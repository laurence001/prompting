# Developing prompting strategies for fact-checking
Supporting materials for the paper "Developing Prompting Strategies for Fact-Checking." This repository includes prompt templates, task definitions, and prompt formulations used in a comparative evaluation of large language models (LLMs) for three fact-checking tasks such as summarisation, verdict formulation, and headline generation. 

## Tasks:
- **Condensation**: Summarising fact-checks into concise leads.
- **Evaluation**: Providing verdicts based on evidence.
- **Generation**: Creating headlines reflecting the claim and verdict.

This dataset supports reproducibility and further research in prompt engineering.
