FC_01;Bullet points;Story of wolf and scared boys reaches Christiansborg Palace. But it's a cat, experts say; 1. Two schoolboys from Esbjerg had to sit scared in a tree for an hour and a half, hiding from a wolf that was circling below them. 2. JydskeVestkysten writes this in an article, where they also include the boys' own video recording of the animal.3. The incident has sparked a lot of debate on social media and among politicians. But according to experts, it wasn't a wolf at all that the boys encountered, but a big cat. ;"Two boys aged 11 and 12 from Esbjerg had an experience on Thursday last week that made them ""really scared"". While they were killing time climbing trees near their school, they suddenly saw a wolf approaching. The boys climbed four meters up the tree, where they had to wait for an hour and a half while the wolf circled below them.  This is reported by JydskeVestkysten , which also publishes a video of the roaming predator that the boys have recorded.  The article is being widely shared on social media, where it is overflowing with comments from people who are angry and outraged that the wolf is getting so close to children. The story has even reached Christiansborg Palace.  The Danish People's Party shares the story on X with the message of regaining security, and Liberal Party member of parliament Anni Matthiesen reports on Facebook about the boys' experience.  The same is done by the Social Democratic member of parliament Anders Kronborg on Facebook, where he writes that “HUMANS come before WOLF”. Anders Kronborg is also a former city council member in Esbjerg Municipality, an open advocate for regulating wolves, and one of the two boys is his nephew. But it seems that it was not a wolf at all that the boys sought refuge from and filmed. JydskeVestkysten has also clarified their article and, among other things, changed the headline.  A Facebook user shares the video and points out that doubts have been raised about whether it is actually a wolf.Not a wolf, but a catTjekDet has been in contact with two of Denmark's leading wolf experts, who assess that it is not a wolf that appears in the boys' video recording of the incident. They both assess that it is another animal that the boys have seen. ""It is certainly not a wolf seen in the film. Judging from the animal's size and movements, it is a cat. Probably a long-haired one,"" says Peter Sunde, professor and wolf expert at the Department of Ecoscience at Aarhus University. Kent Olsen, wolf expert and scientific director of senior researchers at the Natural History Museum, makes the same assessment. ""I have seen the recording and read the article. The recording shows that it is a cat and not a wolf,"" writes Kent Olsen in an email to TjekDet. In addition to the video that the experts have reviewed and which, according to them, does not show a wolf, JydskeVestkysten also includes a picture in the article that allegedly comes from the video. The picture shows an animal that may well resemble a wolf. The caption states that the picture is a screenshot from the video recording that the boys took from the tree, and that the boys had no doubt that it was a wolf. Sign up for the CheckIt newsletter Louise Lauritsen, editor-in-chief and local editor of JydskeVestkysten in Esbjerg, informs TjekDet that the editorial staff did not take the screenshot from the boys' video themselves. The image was sent by the boys.  JydskeVestkysten has not wanted to release the boys' full-length recording to TjekDet, but says that they are in possession of it.  Following TjekDet's inquiry, JydskeVestkysten has provided a clarification in their article. “The headline of the article was changed on April 14th at 1:30 p.m. after several experts, whom JydskeVestkysten has spoken to, cast doubt on whether it was a wolf that scared the boys,” the media outlet now writes. They have also changed the headline from “Two boys sat up in a tree for an hour and a half while a wolf circled below them” to “Two boys sat up in a tree for an hour and a half out of fear of a wolf” . In an email to TjekDet, Louise Lauritsen acknowledges that JydskeVestkysten should have made more linguistic reservations in the article and not concluded that it was a wolf. She does not answer directly whether they still believe that it is most likely that the boys saw a wolf. Instead, she writes: “We have conveyed the boys' experience of being scared by a wolf. We perceive the children and their parents as credible sources and without alternative motive.” CheckedIs the wasp really more dangerous than the wolf? The original article also reports that the janitor at the nearby school also saw a wolf in the area the day after the two boys. JydskeVestkysten also clarifies this in the updated version. “The school janitor informs JydskeVestkysten that he has seen a dog-like animal in the area,” it now reads. They have also changed the caption to what is allegedly a screenshot from the two boys' video recording. ""They (the boys, ed.) had no doubt that this was a wolf, but experts do not agree,"" JydskeVestkysten has now added to the description. TjekDet has tried unsuccessfully to get in touch with the boys and their parents. CheckedViral appeal is good enough: A fallen sheep can die if it is not helped upWolves on Danish soilAlthough it is in all likelihood not a wolf that the boys have videotaped, wolves have been seen before to come close to people - even in cities.This happened earlier in April, when JydskeVestkysten reported a story about a wolf that had visited Tistrup and Ansager in Varde Municipality on a Saturday. Shortly before, Oksbøl, which is also located in Varde Municipality, had also had a wolf visit.If you like TjekDet's articles and want to make sure you don't miss the latest, follow us on Facebook by clicking here .

FC_02;Bullet points;The Trump circle again makes the false claim that Greenlanders want to be part of the United States;American Trump supporters continue to claim that Greenlanders want to be part of the United States.  But there is nothing to indicate that this is the wish of the Greenlanders.   According to a researcher, the Trump administration is trying to convince a skeptical American public that annexing Greenland is a good idea.  But we do not know the Greenlanders' position on negotiating a cooperation agreement with the United States, and such an option is still on the table.;"This is the fact-check :While US Vice President JD Vance was visiting American soldiers at Pituffik Space Base in northwestern Greenland at the end of March, Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna was on live air on Fox News .Here she said that not only is Greenland a strategically good place for the United States, but ""the Greenlandic population is a big supporter of potentially becoming an American territory.""It is far from the first time that President Donald Trump himself or his circle of supporters have said that Greenlanders would like to be part of the United States. Back in January, the president claimed, in connection with his desire to take over Greenland, for example , that “the Greenlandic people will be with us.”So is there really anything to talk about? Do Greenlanders want to belong to the United States, since the Trump circle keeps repeating it?Live on Fox News, Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna reiterates that Greenlanders want to be American territory.Wants American support""No, there is nothing to suggest that at all,"" says Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen , an associate professor at the Danish Defence Academy's Centre for Arctic Security Studies, referring to a poll by the research institute Verian .The same poll was also used back in January to refute Donald Trump's claim that Greenlanders want to be part of the United States. Verian's poll found that only six percent of Greenlanders want to leave the Commonwealth and instead become part of the United States. A full 85 percent answered no to the same question. Yet Trump supporters seem to be sticking to the claim. The reason for this must be found within American borders, believes Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen.""In the US, the idea of taking over Greenland is also unpopular. The Trump administration is trying to influence public opinion so that it will appear as a good idea. It requires a narrative that the US can really get a lot out of it, and that the Greenlanders are on board with it,"" he says.A new poll from the Pew Research Center shows that there is low support among Americans for Trump's plan to take over Greenland. 54 percent do not believe that the United States should take over Greenland, while 23 percent are in favor.Fraudulent measurementHowever, there is one opinion poll that supports the Trump circle's interpretation of the Greenlanders' position. Back in January, the organization Patriot Polling presented startling figures shortly after Donald Trump Jr.'s visit to Nuuk. A full 57 percent of Greenlanders reportedly supported the idea of Greenland joining the United States.The Trump-loyal podcaster Charlie Kirk, who was with Donald Trump Jr. in Nuuk, circulated the poll and said that Greenlanders want to be part of the United States . However, experts have since denied that the numbers say anything precise about Greenlanders' attitudes.Either the numbers have been tampered with, or they are freely invented , says Ulrik Pram Gad, a senior researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies (DIIS).“I'm not sure they've even spoken to anyone in Greenland. According to the methodology description, Patriot Polling calls landlines. But there are no landlines in Greenland at all,” he says.  The Verian poll is not perfect either, says Ulrik Pram Gad, because it is difficult to conduct polls in Greenland. Verian's Greenlandic respondents were not selected representatively, just as in the aforementioned question they are asked two things at once. That is, both whether they want to leave the Commonwealth and whether they want to join the USA.“It is methodologically fragile, but the answers are so overwhelming that you can take it as a strong indication that Greenlanders do not want to be part of the USA,” says Ulrik Pram Gad.The people of Greenland want to join America! https:";https://www-tjekdet-dk.translate.goog/faktatjek/trump-kredsen-fremsaetter-igen-forkert-paastand-om-groenlaenderne-vil-vaere-en-del-af-usa?_x_tr_sl=da&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=fr&_x_tr_pto=wapp
FC_03;Bullet points;Has Zelensky bought Hitler's old summer residence?;"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has purchased Adolf Hitler's former summer home, according to several posts on social media.  But the story is fabricated and is in all likelihood an example of Russian disinformation.  According to researchers, false allegations about the Ukrainian president have flared up after Donald Trump called the Ukrainian president a ""dictator.""";"This is the fact-checkUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has purchased Adolf Hitler's old summer house, Kehlsteinhaus, also known as the Eagle's Nest, for more than 100 million kroner.This is the claim in several posts on both X and Facebook , which also link the summer house purchase with the aid that Ukraine receives from the United States to wage war on Russia. The posts have been viewed hundreds of thousands of times.The posts include photos of alleged purchase contracts and a video detailing the building's history as Adolf Hitler's summer residence, while explaining that the house has now been sold to an Italian company owned by the Ukrainian president.According to the posts, the story about the summer house purchase comes from ""German media"", but the only German media outlet that TjekDet has been able to find the story from is the unknown Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland .It turns out that the ""German"" media is actually a Russian propaganda outlet. And Zelenskyy did not buy Hitler's summer house.Hitler's summer residenceKehlsteinhaus was given to Hitler in 1939 as a 50th birthday present by German Nazi politician Martin Bormann. The building gets its name because it is located on the top of the Kehlstein mountain, a whopping 1,834 meters above sea level.Hitler's visits to the house were few and far between, however , because he disliked the heights and the elevator that had to be used to reach the house at the time. The risk of lightning strikes was also not a weather forecast that the German dictator liked.The video, now being shared on social media, shows that President Zelenskyy has purchased the building from the state-owned Bavarian company Immobilien Freistaat Bayern (IMBY), whose director, Gerhard Reichel , according to the video, comments on the sale as follows:“Such transactions with historic sites are very rare. However, in this case, due to the high state subsidy required to ensure the ongoing operation (of the building, ed.), it was only a matter of time before a sale would take place,” it says.But the statement and the sale of Kehlsteinhaus are, according to IMBY, pure fabrication.“The Kehlsteinhaus remains in the ownership of the Free State of Bavaria. A sale has not taken place and is not planned. The alleged purchase contract shown in the video is false, as is the alleged quote from the IMBY management,” IMBY states on their website .They also state that they will take legal action against those who spread the false information on the internet.""Volodymyr Zelenskyj bought the Kehlsteinhaus, which previously belonged to Hitler,"" writes the media outlet Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland, which is apparently German. But the website hides a secret. Photo: Screenshot.The arrow points towards RussiaAs mentioned, the false story was published by the “German” media outlet Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland, and it is most likely a website created for the purpose of spreading Russian disinformation.CheckDet has not been able to find any traces of the media website from before December 14, 2024. According to various services that monitor changes to websites, the first activity on the website was seen on that very day. It was also on December 14 that the website was first archived through the Wayback Machine service.If you search for the website on Google, there are no results from before December 2024.The website also appears on the list of 100 fake websites that, among others, the German fact-checking media Correctiv has identified as being created with the aim of spreading Russian disinformation ahead of the German elections on February 23, 2025.Correctiv has dubbed the influence operation Storm-1516, and according to the media outlet, the operation has links to the Russian troll factory Internet Research Agency (IRA) and the Russian military intelligence service GRU.The false story also ties in with many other stories about Volodymyr Zelenskyj, which TjekDet has previously fact-checked. Among other things, the president's wife is said to have acquired a Bugatti , and Zelenskyj himself is said to have bought a hotel casino in Cyprus .And the strategy seems to be the same.The Bugatti story was also published on a newly created website that, like Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland, imitates a real news site, where a few fake ones are planted among a sea of true stories - typically with an angle on Russia. Probably to strengthen credibility.Reaction to Trump's dictator accusationThe news outlet AFP writes that false allegations about Volodymyr Zelensky have flared up after US President Donald Trump, among other things, called the Ukrainian president a ""dictator"".""We have observed a significant resurgence of anti-Ukrainian disinformation on US social media, much of which appears to be recycled content from previous Russian influence campaigns,"" McKenzie Sadeghi, an analyst at disinformation watchdog NewsGuard, told AFP .""Trump's comments appear to have sparked renewed interest in anti-Ukrainian narratives that had previously faded,"" Sadeghi further told AFP .Joseph Bodnar, a researcher at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, explains to AFP that the Russian influence attempts focus on ""creating animosity between the Trump and Zelenskyy administrations.""""Russia wants to convince American negotiators that Ukraine is their enemy, not their ally.

FC_04;Lead;Green trees in February 1722 not proof of climate change;"An old newspaper clipping about green trees in the spring of 1722 is making the rounds on social media, but the content doesn't mean what the spreaders seem to think. And the ""source"" turns out to be suspiciously similar to another text - which is about Germany.";"This is the fact-check :For several years, a newspaper clipping with the headline “In February 1722, all the trees were completely green” has been circulating among climate skeptics on social media. The Source Criticism Agency is investigating the origin of the image – and the truth behind its content.It turns out that the anecdotal article doesn't actually say anything about the climate. And when we dig deeper into the archives, it turns out that large parts of the text aren't even about Swedish conditions – but about the weather in Germany.Post on Facebook with the image April 23, 2024.This is the text in what appears to be a photocopied newspaper article:  In February 1722, all the trees were completely green  . There have certainly been mild winters in the past. Gunnar Carlberg, who is also SMHI's precipitation monitor in Finspång, has looked through old scrapbooks and found the following interesting statistics:  In 1172, the winter was so mild that the trees turned green at the end of January. The birds built their nests and molted in February.  In 1241, the trees were fully leafed out in March.  In 1269, there was no winter at all.  In 1421, the trees bloomed in March and the vines in April, when there were also ripe gooseberries.  In 1538, the trees in the gardens were in full bloom already in December!  In 1585, the corn was in ear at Easter time.  In 1588, the trees turned green in February.  In 1538, 1607, 1617, 1650 and 1659, there was neither snow nor frost.  In 1722, all the trees were green in February.  In 1863, in Skåne, you could pick fully bloomed daisies in February.  NT Wednesday, February 15, 1989 The source criticism agency begins by examining the context in which the image was shared. The first post we find is from 2015 on the blog Klimatupplysningen, which is run by Klimatrealisterna, formerly the Stockholm Initiative. In 2010, the lobby group Stockholm Initiative was named Misleader of the Year by the public education association Vetenskap och Folkbildning . In the book “Upphettning: demokratin i klimatkrisens tid” (published in 2020 by the publisher Fri tanke), the Climate Realists are identified as “the hub of the Swedish denial movement”.  It was on Christmas Eve 2015 that Klimatupplysningen posted the image, stating that it came from a reader. The blog post has 112 comments.Commentary on Klimatupplysningen's blog post 2015.However, it will take five years for the image to truly go viral. Most of the shares we find are from 2020. The newspaper clipping appears on Twitter/X, Facebook and blogs that are skeptical of climate research. The fact that the picture is gaining momentum in the spring of 2020 is probably due to the fact that the spring was warmer and drier than normal that year, according to SMHI's measurements. In the cities of Gothenburg, Nordkoster, Visby and Hoburg, records were broken in the number of hours of sunshine. Weather and climate were on people's lips.But now it's spring again and the latest sharing we can find of the picture is from last week. A man writes on Facebook:It's time to let go of the lies that people's way of life affects the climate... The climate has always varied and this depends, among other things, on the activities of the sun...The post has over 500 interactions on Facebook. “This is something for all our almost religious climate activists to read,” writes one person in the comments section.But is what the post writer claims really true?No, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) writes in its latest report that “human influence, mainly through greenhouse gas emissions, has unequivocally warmed the climate system”. It is also “unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, the ocean and the land”. “The global average temperature has increased faster since 1970 than during any other 50-year period for at least the last 2,000 years.”– According to the UN's climate panel IPCC, the global warming that has occurred since 1980 is mainly caused by anthropogenic greenhouse gases, i.e. the greenhouse gases that humans have added to the atmosphere. But that does not mean that there are also other natural climate variations, explains Sverker Hellström, meteorologist at SMHI.We will return to the science later in the article.The newspaper article from 1989The content of the NT article itself has been quoted by climate skeptics in several editorial media. For example, in articles in the Länstidningen (LT) in Östersund and on the debate page of the newspaper Norra Skånes .But what does the image of the article actually prove? Our review is not going to show much at all.We start with the authenticity of the material. With the naked eye, you can see that the image appears to have been scanned and appears to consist of two parts cut together. A date from the newspaper, “NT Wednesday 5 February 1989” and the news text itself. NT is short for Norrköpings Tidningar, a newspaper founded in 1758 and now Sweden’s oldest daily newspaper still in publication.A number of larger libraries in Sweden have old Swedish newspapers preserved on microfilm.Carolina Rediviva. Photo: Dr. Mirko Junge/Wikimedia commonsAt the Carolina Rediviva University Library in Uppsala, we check to see if an article with the headline ""In February 1722 all the trees were completely green"" was published in the NT on February 15, 1989. And yes, it was.On the local pages for Finspång in NT there is the article, also not signed with a name, just like in the viral image. It is therefore some kind of local news article, but the text has an unusually slangy form for newspaper prose. No quotes, just lists of different years.SMHI's “precipitation monitor”The only source reference in the article is to a Gunnar Carlberg who is stated to be a so-called precipitation monitor for SMHI in Finspång. The title is so unusual that the only results we get when we google “precipitation monitor” are back to the NT article from 1989.There are also no notes at SMHI about a Gunnar Carlberg who worked for the authority. However, there is an Inez Carlberg who was a precipitation observer in Finspång in the 80s.– You can imagine that Gunnar was Inez's husband and that they ran the weather station together, muses Sverker Hellström, meteorologist at SMHI.According to the article, Gunnar is said to have “looked through old music albums and found the following interesting statistics.” It may sound like Gunnar did this in his capacity as a member of some role at SMHI, but that is not the case, states Sverker Hellström.Post on Facebook with the newspaper article 2020.A precipitation monitor checks the rain gauge once a day, but the job does not involve any further analysis of the weather and wind – and certainly not going back in time. Gunnar (or someone else) would have collected his clips as a private person, not as an employee of SMHI.– You might get the feeling that the information in the article comes from SMHI, but that is not the case, says Sverker Hellström to Källkritikbyrån.Which ""clip albums"" Gunnar Carlberg would have looked at is also not clear from the NT article. The source reference itself is weak to say the least. Clip albums often refer to newspaper clippings, but the oldest Swedish newspaper, Post- och Inrikestidningar, was founded in 1645 – that is, long after several of the years mentioned in the article.Weather measurements started in 1722The NT article itself basically consists of just a list of mild seasons from different seasons. The first weather note dates back to 1172. But in 1172 no weather measurements were made in Sweden.Comment on Facebook March 13.It was also only in the 17th and 18th centuries that humans invented measuring tools for temperature and climate. And the oldest Swedish weather observations in Sweden date back to 1722. They were made at the weather station in Uppsala.– The measurement series began in 1722 and it was professors Anders Celsius and Eric Burman who initiated them, says Erik Sahlée, senior lecturer in meteorology at Uppsala University and responsible for Uppsala University's weather observations.Are these the oldest weather observations in Sweden?– Yes, that's it.But the information that appears in the NT article, can't it be true anyway?– It may be that they are correct. But this is just a snapshot, scattered years. Even if they were correct as individual weather observations, they say nothing about what it looks like over time. A weather station's data for a certain year says nothing about what the climate was like. Here, you jump from year to year and do not describe any longer measurement series, says Erik Sahlée.Search result on Pettersson's blog 2018.The weather notes in the text actually say nothing about the climate, but describe local weather at a certain time. And the question is, are they even about Swedish conditions?From a magazine for American SwedesA private individual conducted his own viral review of the image in January 2020 in a local Facebook group. He believes that the article text comes from a clip from March 2, 1944, from the newspaper Vestkusten, a weekly newspaper for Swedes on the Pacific coast.Comment on Facebook January 5, 2020.According to Wikipedia, Vestkusten is actually a newspaper that existed. It was originally a Swedish-language newspaper that was published in California from 1887 to 2007. The newspaper is preserved in digital form at the California Digital Newspaper Collection .Peace talks, bombing raids and ration cards are some of the topics covered on the newspaper's front page on March 2, 1944. There is still full-scale war in Europe and between the USA and Japan.Vestkusten front page March 2, 1944We search through article by article in the digitized newspaper – and a few pages in we actually find a text that is confusingly similar to that published in the NT.This is what Vestkusten writes:Speaking of the mild winter, Sv. Landsbygden has collected the following rather unusual statistics about mild winters:In 1172 the winter was so mild that the trees turned green at the end of January and the birds built their nests and moulted in February.In 1241 the trees were fully leafed out in March, i.e. six weeks earlier than usual.In 1269 there was no winter at all, the temperature was so warm that the girls in the Rhine region could adorn themselves with violet wreaths at Christmas time.In 1289 there was no winter either and the temperature was as mild as the latter year at the same time. In1421 the trees bloomed in March and the vines in April, when there were also ripe gooseberries.In 1538 the gardens were in full bloom in December.In 1572 the trees already bore leaves in February, just like in 1172.In 1588 the trees were green in February.In 1538, 1607 and 1659 there was neither snow nor frost.In 1601 and 1609 there was no winter in southern Germany.In 1662 the winter was so mild that even in northern Germany people did not light fires in tiled stoves and the trees bloomed in February.In 1722 all the trees were green in February.In 1807 Bore did not come to visit at all.In 1834 the winter was as mild as the last mentioned.In 1863 in Skåne you could pick fully bloomed daisies in February. In 1870 New Year's Day was celebrated in Petersburg at a temperature of eight degrees.From the newspaper Vestkusten, March 2, 1944It is largely the same text that was published in NT 45 years later. But here the reference is to Sv. Landsbygden and not to any rainfall monitor in Finspång. Sv. Landsbygden is probably short for the newspaper Svenska Landsbygden. We have received confirmation from the Royal Library (KB) that the newspaper existed at this time.About German weatherFurthermore, the text in the West Coast is somewhat longer than that in the NT, and several of the dates refer to conditions in Germany.– It is not clear in the NT article that the notes come from any particular place. In 1863 it says about Skåne itself and then we had started our own measurements. But otherwise it does not say where it took place, so it could be in Germany, says Sverker Hellström at SMHI.According to SMHI's records, the average temperature in Skåne in January and February 1863 was plus degrees.– It was certainly experienced as warm then. But if you compare it to today, for example, the average temperature in Lund in 2020 was three degrees warmer than it was in 1863.The information in the form of a submission in Folkbladet 2022 .We cannot say for sure if it is the same text that is reused in the NT, but there is much evidence to suggest so. Both we ourselves and the Google AI service NootbookLM have difficulty finding differences between the texts.It seems as if someone has taken the original text and edited out certain years, as well as all information about Germany. And suddenly a new story about Swedish springs and winters has been created. A story that is not entirely true – and which is now being used to mislead on the internet.Climate change and weatherSo what was it like now, is there a difference between climate and weather?– Yes, there is a difference between climate and weather. I usually make the following analogy: the climate tells you what clothes to bring and the weather tells you what clothes to wear. The climate is what you expect and the weather is what you get. A climate has a natural weather variation and the variations become larger if we look at a smaller area, says Erik Sahlée at Uppsala University.Comment on Facebook March 13.To describe changes in the climate, weather observations from continuous, longer time series and larger geographical areas are needed. These also exist.– If you look up and compile what we have seen across Europe and the world, the warming global trend is not something to discuss. That it is happening as a result of human influence is also not something to discuss. Now we need to start talking about what we should do about climate change instead – and how we can adapt.How do we know that climate change is due to human influence?– Physics shows that. When you just look at how natural factors affect global temperature, you don't get as strong a warming as we have. We humans have created that amplification.Overall: Many have used the image to contradict the idea that humans are behind the global warming that is currently taking place. But according to research, it is people's way of life that has affected the climate.And as for the photographed article itself, it turned out to have made a remarkable journey across media of different times. An article about German weather from the 1940s was remade in the Swedish local press in the 1980s into something that appears to apply to Sweden and that appears to come from a representative of SMHI – to finally spin around as a screenshot on Facebook in the 2020s.

FC_05;Bullet points;Insects are a new ingredient in the stew of conspiracy theories;Edible insects are being touted as a win for both the climate and the environment. But the insects are provoking the anger of both conspiracy theorists and far-right politicians.;Here is the fact-check paper:A new type of food is slowly creeping into the company of 5G technology and corona vaccines. On social media, in alternative online media and among European politicians on the far right, there is a particular aversion to edible insects.Not only are insects, which fall under the category of novel food, called unappetizing, they are also seen in corners of the internet as part of an international elite's plan to introduce a new world order.Rikke Peters, an associate professor at UCL Business Academy and researcher into conspiracy theories, is new to the idea that edible insects have become a topic in conspiracy circles. But she is not the least bit surprised:“I see several parallels to existing conspiracy theories. The edible insects tap into a fear that an elite will impose some kind of eco-dictatorship and take away our individual food choices,” she says.But how did insects end up in cahoots with people like Bill Gates, and why are they interpreted as part of a socialist takeover of the world?Multi-faceted climate benefitInsects have attracted great interest as a food source because advocates have recognized that they contain large amounts of protein and are therefore suitable as both food and animal feed. Among the more popular edible insects are species such as the grasshopper, mealworm and cricket, and their production emits far less CO2 than the animals we normally eat. According to the National Food Institute at the Technical University of Denmark, for example, the production of cattle emits 100 times more greenhouse gases than the production of edible insects.Among those who care about climate and the environment, we find international organizations such as the UN and the World Economic Forum. The UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) praises insects for being nutritious , sustainable and cheap, and thus a tool to end hunger and help developing countries in a sustainable way.

FC_06;Assertion;Correct, but also a bit misleading about emissions cuts;AssertionDuring the last year of last year, the Labor Party government has cut as much as all the last governments under Ola Svenneby and my lifetime.Astrid Hoem. Youth Party Leader Debate, Arendal Week 2024, 14.08.2024 ConclusionThis is true if we refer to emissions per year, and take 1990 as the starting point compared to 2022 and 2023. Preliminary figures show that greenhouse gas emissions in Norway in 2023 were 4.7 percent lower than the previous year, and 9.1 percent lower than in 1990. In 2022, emissions were 4.6 percent lower than in 1990.;"This is the fact-check:Climate was one of the big topics when the youth party leaders met for a debate at Arendal Week. Among others, AUF's Astrid Hoem and Ola Svenneby from Unge Høyre met for a duel.With increasingly short speaking time, claims were made about whose government had built the most offshore wind turbines and who had cut greenhouse gas emissions the most.Astrid Hoem stated that the Conservative governments have performed poorly on climate, and made the following claim:– During the last year of last year, the Labor Party government has cut as much as all the last governments under Ola Svenneby and my lifetime.Later, the AUF leader repeated the claim that the Labour Party/Socialist Party government has cut more: – Now the numbers are very clear. We have cut as much in one year last year as has been cut during our entire lifetime of government terms. Read more fact checks from the youth party leadership debate:Outdated emission targets from Simen VelleThis shows the emissions figuresWhat do the actual emissions figures show, and is it true that as much was cut in one year in 2023 as under all the last governments in the lifetime of the youth politicians?In any case, it is true that the figures show a clear decrease in Norwegian greenhouse gas emissions in 2023.Statistics Norway's preliminary figures for Norwegian greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 show that greenhouse gas emissions in Norway decreased by 4.7 percent compared to the previous year. In total, emissions ended at 46.6 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalents , which was 2.3 million tonnes lower than in 2022. According to Statistics Norway, emissions decreased, among other things, because there was less activity in industry and fewer emissions from the oil and gas industry – and because Norwegians drove more electric cars.A decrease of 4.7 percent from 2022 to 2023 is greater than the percentage decrease between other individual years from 1990 to the present.If we look at the actual size of the emission cuts per year, there was only one year that had larger cuts: In 2009, emissions decreased by 2.5 million tons.Statistics Norway's figures for 2023 are preliminary, and it is expected that they will change somewhat when final figures are presented in November.– We therefore cannot yet say for sure that 2023 is the year with the largest decline in the time series, emphasizes Trude Melby Bothner, senior advisor at Statistics Norway, to Faktisk.no.9.1 percent down from 19902023 could therefore be the single year with the largest reduction, even though we are still far from the climate goals. But Hoem's statement can be interpreted as meaning that the cut in 2023 was as large as all other emissions cuts from various governments combined.When Faktisk.no contacts AUF and asks about the basis for the claim, they refer to developments since 1990. 1990 is often used as a reference year, because the climate goals and the Paris Agreement are based on this year.Greenhouse gas emissions in 2022 were 4.6 percent lower than in 1990. By 2023, the emission reduction had increased to 9.1 percent. It is therefore true that the cut in 2023 was approximately the same size as the emission cut between 1990 and 2022. But this way of calculating skips all the years between 1990 and 2022. If we look more closely at these years, the picture is more complex.Borgar Aamaas, senior researcher at the Cicero Center for Climate Research, believes that Hoem's statement is both correct and misleading . – If the point is to make it clear that the current government has pursued climate policies that have led to large emissions cuts versus previous governments that have not achieved this, these statements are very misleading, the climate scientist tells Faktisk.no.Climate measures in road traffic and oil and gas extraction, and lower activity in industry, contributed to the decline from 2022 to 2023, according to Statistics Norway. Photo: Tor Erik Schrøder / NTBA challenge with greenhouse gas emissions in Norway is that they increased from the starting year 1990 and stabilized in the 2000s with 2007 as the peak year, before gradually declining with an increasingly steep curve, the researcher explains.– With 1990 as the main year, it can be said that emissions have not decreased significantly, and that the decrease in 2023 is about the same as in 1990-2022.This is not the case if you start from other years. Hoem was born in 1995, and Svenneby in 1997:	Emissions in 1995 were only slightly above the 1990 level, and in that sense Hoem's analysis holds up, with a total decrease of 9.8 percent from 1995 to 2023, explains Aamaas.	In 1997 , emissions were somewhat higher. This gives a decrease of 14.6 percent from 1997 to 2023. Last year's cut will then be a smaller part of the total cut.The peak in emissions was in 2007. Since then, emissions have been reduced by 17.4 percent. Less than a quarter (23%) of this emission reduction came last year.– Thus, one can also argue that the emission reduction while the bourgeois government was in power between 2013-2021 was far greater than what has happened under the current government, based on the same statistics that Hoem has used, says Aamas.– But the current government has not been in office for that long, so it is not surprising that the cut so far is not that large, he adds.Borgar Aamaas is a researcher with a meteorology background at the Center for Climate Research, CICERO. Photo: Baard SalvesenAamaas points out that emissions are influenced by many factors over a long period of time – local and international politics, business and general societal trends that together explain emissions trends.– Furthermore, it can take a long time from when a policy is adopted and implemented until it has an impact on emissions statistics.An example of this is the electric car policy, which we can trace back to the 1990s, but where the effect of the policy has only become truly visible in recent years, the researcher points out.– Who then has the credit for the emissions cuts that are happening now? Similarly, the conservative side can argue that policies they implemented while they were in government are now showing up in the numbers and providing an additional emissions cut, says Aamaas.– The short version is that this is complicated, and it is not the case that any sitting government is fully responsible for emissions trends while they are in power.To summarize, Hoem's claim is correct under certain assumptions, but it is also a bit misleading.It is true that the cuts were as much in 2023 as between 1990 and 2022, but the cuts were more overall during Svenneby's lifetime or during Erna Solberg's government. Nor can the government necessarily take credit for the emissions going down on their watch.Astrid Hoem writes in an email to Faktisk.no that 1990 is the starting point in ""all climate debate"" when talking about climate cuts.– That is the reference year we use. It is a fact that the same amount of cuts were made in 2023 as was done from 1990 until then, she writes.– So I tried to say this in a somewhat funny way. The most important thing for me is that greenhouse gas emissions are cut, and it is no secret that AUF wants to speed things up even more.";https://www-faktisk-no.translate.goog/faktasjekk/riktig-men-ogsa-litt-misvisende-om-utslippskutt/102711?_x_tr_sl=no&_x_tr_tl=fr&_x_tr_hl=fr&_x_tr_pto=wapp
FC_07;Bullet points;Posts about anthropogenic CO2 in the atmosphere use partially correct figures to draw completely wrong conclusions;Man-made CO2 constitutes such a tiny fraction of the atmosphere that it has absolutely no impact on climate change. This is what several Facebook posts say, where CO2's share of the atmosphere is stated to be only 0.04 percent and humans' contribution to only 0.0016 percent of the total CO2 concentration. The numbers in the posts are partially correct. But the conclusion is not, researchers tell TjekDet.;"This is the fact-check: How can one ever believe that humans have any influence on the climate in the big picture, when man-made CO2 only constitutes a “vanishingly small fraction” of 0.0016 percent of the total CO2 concentration in the atmosphere of 0.04 percent?This is what is stated in numerous Facebook posts , where the claim is used to downplay the role of humans in climate change. The conclusion in the posts is that the man-made CO 2 in the atmosphere has absolutely no influence.Along with the claims, a graph is shared that supposedly illustrates the composition of the gases that make up the atmosphere. Here, human-caused CO2 emissions - the tiny white dot in the right corner - are compared with the total CO2 concentration - the green dots - in the Earth's atmosphere.ZeroPhoto: Screenshot of Facebook postBut neither the graph nor the numbers are proof that humans' spread of CO 2 in the atmosphere is insignificant. Because even a small change in the amount of CO 2  has an impact on global warming, shows a previous fact check from TjekDet , which includes some of the same claims.CO2 emissions in the big picturePeter Langen , a professor at the Department of Environmental Science at Aarhus University, told TjekDet last year that it is correct that 0.04 percent of the air molecules in the atmosphere are CO2 molecules . But even though the percentage may seem quite small, its significance cannot be ignored. ""Before we humans started changing things, there was between 0.02 and 0.03 percent CO 2 in the atmosphere. We humans have caused the concentration to increase to 0.04 percent. And this change has contributed greatly to the increase in temperature on Earth,"" Peter Langen explained to TjekDet.He has previously come across the figure 0.04 percent, where it is used as an argument that human CO2 emissions have no significance in the big picture. So is Sebastian Mernild , who is professor and head of the SDU Climate Cluster at the University of Southern Denmark.He explained to TjekDet that a different unit of measurement is typically used, namely parts per million (ppm), which refers to the concentration of - in this case - CO2 molecules per million molecules in the air. And according to Sebastian Mernild, it will typically fluctuate naturally between 180 ppm when we have an ice age, and 280 ppm when we have an interglacial period , which we have now.CheckedThe rise in CO2 in the atmosphere has caused temperatures to rise. And there is no doubt that human interference plays a significant role, say researchers.

But they are ""deepfakes"" made by scammers to sell a fake drug.";"This is the fact-check : The Source Criticism Agency has previously noted that Lars Wallentin, a senior professor of cardiology in Uppsala, was exploited in a hoax video in which he allegedly made revelations about the Covid-19 vaccine. – Total fake, completely out of touch with reality, the real Lars Wallentin commented on the video in May. That video has since been taken down, but another video is also being spread in which Wallentin is alleged to have been murdered, shot in his car. From deepfake hoax video on Facebook April 22. The new video has been viewed nearly 9,000 times so far, according to Facebook's counter.The fraudsters behind the videos have used AI to make it look like real people are acting in front of the camera, so-called deepfakes . What appears to be SVT news anchor Lisbeth Åkerman is seen in the video reporting on a news event.This is what the AI clone of Åkerman says:A terrible tragedy occurred in Stockholm this morning. The well-known cardiologist Lars Wallentin was shot dead in his car at a busy intersection. The police have found empty shells from a firearm. Everything indicates that it was a carefully planned attack. An eyewitness, a young woman, tearfully described how the doctor was hit by three shots and fell over the steering wheel. The day before his death, Lars Wallentin revealed shocking information about the Swedish healthcare system to our reporter – information that cost him his life. What was it about? Listen on.From deepfaked video on Facebook April 22 Then, an AI-generated copy of Lars Wallentin begins to tell us how he created a pill that can ""clean the vessels"" and prevent premature death, but also more common health problems such as headaches, fatigue, swelling and varicose veins. From deepfake hoax video on Facebook April 22. The AI clone says he has received threats, but that he “will not remain silent,” and describes the pharmaceutical industry as a “mafia.” “Lars Wallentin” says this:It's your choice. It's your pain. It's your death. I'm not bought by anyone. I'm a scientist who has finally given people something they've never had before. A real way to survive. At my age, I've cleared my vessels and feel amazing. You can do it too if you dare to take the step.From deepfaked video on Facebook April 22 Differences from the previous videoIn the previous video, a connection was made to the Covid-19 vaccine and various incorrect claims about it, but these have been completely removed this time.The video is being shared by a different account than the previous one, but it looks almost exactly the same, with the same images and descriptions. The account claims to be an American advertising agency. The account on Facebook. The video refers to where you can read more, but this time there is no link. It did when the second video was spread – anyone who clicked on it then came to a fake SVT page. Fake SVT site. There, the reader was given a tip, again by “Lars Wallentin”, about a kind of capsule with dietary supplements, “Frank & Frey CBD Capsules”. The tablets were supposed to clear your blood vessels, give you enormous strength and perfect vision. Källkritikbyrån has been in contact with Lars Wallentin after he was allegedly murdered.The “Sun Doctor” also affectedMikael Sandström, a doctor and TV personality known as the “sun doctor,” has also been exploited by scammers in a similar video.In what appears to be a news broadcast from SVT, it is alleged that Sandström ""had his apartment in Stockholm burned down by the pharmaceutical mafia."" From deepfake hoax video on Facebook April 28. AI has then been used to make it appear as if Sandström is being interviewed and then says that the bombing was an attempt to silence him by pharmaceutical companies. “Sandström” then begins to advocate a miracle cure.We have developed a new unique cream formula made exclusively from natural ingredients. This cream instantly relieves inflammation and in just a few weeks completely restores joints and promotes cartilage regeneration. You will forget about arthritis, osteoarthritis, back and joint pain forever.Excerpt from hoax video April 28  From deepfake hoax video on Facebook April 28. Mikael Sandström has previously been interviewed in Aftonbladet and said in January that he was then contacted daily by elderly people who had been scammed by various online fraudsters in his name.– It is incredibly sad and I feel desperate, he told Aftonbladet . The Source Criticism Agency has contacted Sandström.The claims in the videoIn addition to the fact that the fraudsters AI-generated Lars Wallentin and Mikael Sandström, the claims made about cardiovascular diseases themselves are false, according to doctors that Källkritikbyrån spoke to. Taking a tablet to clear the vessels is physiologically a very stupid idea, states Jakob Johansson, chief physician at the healthcare company Aleris. – Hypothetically, if this agent were to cause these plaques, which are a coating on the vessel wall, to loosen, it would lead to a lot of clots going all over the body. But if they mean that this would clear it up so that it just magically disappears, well, then it would be useful. Are there any such pills that “clear the vessels”?– No, that sounds completely unlikely. There is a huge amount of research done on atherosclerosis and there is good treatment for it, but no single “magic bullet” that solves everything, in this way, says Jakob Johansson at Aleris. The Facebook page has been blocked from posting ads. The video claims that the miracle cure would start working after three days. – Sure, an Alvdeon starts working after twenty minutes, but that this would have an effect on something as complex as atherosclerosis is, in my opinion, completely impossible. This is what the voice in the video says:Everyone has it. Stroke, heart attack, paralysis. It's just a matter of time.From deepfake hoax video on Facebook April 22. – No, not everyone is affected by it. It is common in many cultures to get atherosclerosis to a greater or lesser degree, but it does not cause symptoms such as a heart attack or stroke in the majority, no. From Facebook's ad library. The video claims that by the age of 50, the blood vessels are already damaged. How accurate is that?– No, of course that's not true. The vascular tree is exposed to stress, but the majority of the population is not affected, especially not with an impact on circulation. What do you think about this kind of claim being spread like this?– As with all forms of quackery, it's sad because it can lead to people not taking the medical treatment and making the lifestyle changes that we know can reduce atherosclerosis. So it's sad if just one person goes through this, says Johansson.How the films are distributedThe video is still up on Facebook at the time of writing. The account spreading the video has posted 45 ads since March, all of which have been taken down for violating Meta’s rules. The page also appears to have been blocked from posting ads. Ads with the false claims about “sun doctor” Mikael Sandström have not led to any action being taken against one of the pages that spread them: the Facebook page “Hälsosam lässig” (Healthy Lifestyle), which is trying to target Swedish users. Post on Facebook March 26. Overall:  The videos are made with AI and neither the news anchors nor the doctors in the stories are real. They are real, but they have nothing to do with the story. The claims about the remedy that the scammers are trying to sell are false – it is a scam.

FC_09;Bullet points;False claim about the death of 14,000 infants in Gaza spread in media worldwide - including in Danish;14,000 infants in Gaza are at risk of dying from malnutrition within two days, UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher said on Tuesday. But the information is not correct, TjekDet's research shows, and the UN itself acknowledges that Tom Fletcher should have phrased it differently. However, the UN emphasizes that the situation in Gaza is critical and that thousands of children are at risk of dying from malnutrition over the next year;"This is the fact-check:This was reported  in several media outlets  both at home  and abroad on Tuesday , and  politicians and  social media users are reporting the startling figure. The information about the 14,000 infants also found its way into the closing debate of the Folketing on Wednesday.The figure comes from the head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), Tom Fletcher, who appeared on  the BBC's Radio 4 Today programme on Tuesday morning , where he advocated for the need for UN trucks to be allowed to deliver emergency aid to Gaza.""Let me explain what's on those trucks. It's baby food. Baby nutrition. 14,000 babies will die in the next 48 hours if we can't get to them,"" says Tom Fletcher on the BBC program.But it is not correct that 14,000 infants in Gaza are in acute danger of dying within 48 hours. Tom Fletcher's wording was unclear, explains Jens Lærke, spokesperson for OCHA, to TjekDet.“He should have said that 14,000 babies are very likely to suffer from severe acute malnutrition. This means that they are in danger of death and urgently need our help,” says Jens Lærke.Already on Tuesday, the BBC asked where Tom Fletcher got the startling figure.“We point to the urgent need to get supplies in to save the estimated 14,000 infants suffering from severe acute malnutrition in Gaza, as the IPC partnership has warned. We need to get the supplies in as quickly as possible, preferably within the next 48 hours,”  OCHA responded, according to the BBC .Jens Lærke confirms to TjekDet that the figure comes from the IPC, which assesses food security worldwide and with which the UN cooperates.  On May 12, the IPC issued a statement about acute food insecurity in Gaza.It states regarding emergency aid to Gaza that “immediate action is essential to prevent further deaths, hunger and acute malnutrition, and a move towards famine.”However, it does not say that 14,000 infants will die within two days.To TjekDet, the IPC explains that OCHA's interpretation is ""inaccurate."" Instead, the IPC estimates that 14,100 children in Gaza under the age of five will be at risk of severe acute malnutrition. According to the IPC, this means that they risk dying from malnutrition within the next year if they do not receive treatment, but not within 48 hours, as Tom Fletcher said.Aid agencies have long reported widespread famine in Gaza. And although the UN now acknowledges that Tom Fletcher should have expressed himself differently, they emphasize that the situation in Gaza is critical and that thousands of children are at risk of dying from malnutrition over the next year.CheckDet has asked OCHA why Tom Fletcher sets 48 hours as the limit for emergency aid to arrive on time, when the IPC in their report mentions a period from April 2025 to March 2026. It is a  figure of speech , says Jens Lærke from OCHA.""This is to emphasize that it has to be done quickly. We have been told by Israel that the current window for sending aid into Gaza is temporary. It is not necessarily 48 hours, because they have not set a time frame, but it is urgent,"" he says.Jens Lærke says that, to his knowledge, there is no official denial coming from the UN, but that it cannot be ruled out that one will come. He adds that OCHA has explained itself to many media outlets and in doing so has attempted to correct Tom Fletcher's statement.On Tuesday, a number of Danish media outlets published an article from Ritzau claiming that 14,000 infants in Gaza could die within two days.On Wednesday morning, Ritzau published a new article stating that the IPC's projection concerns children under five years of age, and that it concerns a period of one year and not two days.";https://www-tjekdet-dk.translate.goog/faktatjek/forkert-paastand-om-14000-spaedboerns-doed-i-gaza-spredte-sig-i-medier-verden-over-ogsaa?_x_tr_sl=da&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=fr&_x_tr_pto=wapp
FC_10;Bullet points;Images of Danish school classes are misused in international propaganda;Two class photos from Danish schools are going around the world these months. In one class photo, which is of a 9th grader from the school year 2010;"This is the fact to check: Two class photos from Danish schools, which are seen by millions of users on social media, especially abroad, are being misused as documentation that there is apparently a population replacement in Denmark.  ""This is how you change a country. See the difference between 2010 and 2025 at a school in Denmark,"" reads a caption for a post on the social media X.  “Same country, same city, same school, same class, but ten years apart,” reads another post.  The class photos have also been shared by the X-profile Radio Genoa, one of the most well-known voices critical of immigrants on the platform. The profile is followed by more than a million users. Across social media, the photos have been seen by millions of people.  But the pictures cannot be used to document that there is a population change in Denmark. They are neither the same class nor the same school, and there is also a good explanation for the difference in the student composition in the two pictures.  This also suggests that people in Russia are involved in the dissemination of the images. We will return to that part. Zero This is what the post from Radio Genoa looks like on the X platform. The post has been viewed by almost half a million users. CheckIt has chosen to blur the faces in the pictures. Different schools with different students However, it is correct that both images originate from Danish schools.  The first - with the ethnically Danish students - was taken by 9A at Bjerregrav School west of Randers in the school year 2010/2011. The school is a regular elementary school.  The second photo is also taken by a 9th grader, but from an international private school near Copenhagen that has many Muslim students. It was taken in connection with the 2017/2018 school year, according to the school's website - and is therefore not from 2025, as claimed in the posts.  It is therefore not surprising that a primary school in Randers has fewer students with a background other than Danish than an international school near Copenhagen.  Headmaster at Bjerregrav School, Marlene Ankjær, tells TjekDet that she is upset that a picture from her school is being used in misinformation.  ""It is very unfortunate that we are being used in a context that is intended to create concern and division. Therefore, we have of course also reported the user on Facebook who is making this form of fake news,"" she says.  It has not been possible for TjekDet to get a comment from the international school near Copenhagen.  But what does the development of the numbers actually look like?  The Ministry of Children and Education calculates the distribution of students in Danish schools based on ""cultural circles"", which include the categories 'Denmark', 'Western' and 'non-Western'.  At Bjerregrav School in the 2010/2011 school year, when the photos of the 9th grade students were taken, non-Western students made up 2.6 percent. In the 2023/2024 school year, the figure is zero percent. Here, the student composition has therefore gone in the opposite direction to what the postings on X claim.  Nationally, there has been a slight increase in the number of non-Western students. In the 2023/2024 school year, students with a non-Western background made up 11.8 percent of students in the country's primary, secondary and private schools. In the 2010/2011 school year, the proportion was 9.1 percent. Checked Who are the non-Western foreigners everyone is talking about? From TikTok to Russian propaganda TjekDet has not been able to trace the first sharing of the misleading comparison between the two class photos with certainty. The earliest we have been able to find dates from April 15 on X and Instagram. On Instagram, the photos were shared by the far-right page “Europe on Top”. The post has more than 32,000 likes.  However, the text on the images reveals that they originally came from TikTok - this can be seen in the distinctive font.  In other similar posts on X, you can see that the pictures of the school classes are taken as screenshots from TikTok. At the bottom right, you can see that the post on TikTok, where the screenshot was taken, has a whopping 378,000 likes.  TjekDet has not been able to find the images on TikTok.  However, we can see that a few days later the images are being spread as Russian propaganda on Russian websites and by major channels on Telegram.  Among others, by Russian senator Alexey Pushkov, who writes about the photos:  “School class photos in Denmark in 2010 and 2025. The point of no return has been reached.” Checked How five dirty men and a 'Middle Eastern' family ended up in the same photo Another pro-Russian channel on Telegram with more than half a million followers writes about the images:  “A bit of horror. This is how the graduating classes in Denmark have changed over 15 years. If we don't stop the development, we'll soon have the same thing here.”  It is no coincidence that the images have been picked up by pro-Russian actors. The images support a theory of population replacement, which states that Danes will be outnumbered in Denmark in the future in favor of a Muslim majority.  A theory that Russia has often  promoted  because it serves as an example of Western decay for Russia, while at the same time the theory is used to create national cohesion within Russia.  Sign up for the CheckIt newsletter The theory has existed for many years, and is also known internationally as “ The Great Replacement ” - which is perhaps why the posts about schools in Denmark have been shared by so many people on social media.  This is not the first time that Danish schoolchildren have been abused to create a similar false narrative. TjekDet has previously reported how a video of students on a field trip was abused to claim that the students had converted to Islam.";https://www-tjekdet-dk.translate.goog/faktatjek/billeder-af-danske-skoleklasser-misbruges-i-international-propaganda?_x_tr_sl=da&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=fr&_x_tr_pto=wapp
FC_11;Bullet points;Has your Big Mac gotten significantly smaller since the 1980s?; Several viral posts on social media claim that the McDonald's Big Mac has shrunk by 40 percent since 1980.      A picture of a Big Mac, supposedly from the 1980s, is used as documentation.      But TjekDets research shows that there is no indication that the popular burger has shrunk in recent decades. ;This is the fact to chek: A sure winner among hangover-stricken Danes on January 1st is McDonalds - and many probably swear by one of their signature burgers - the Big Mac. But would you have been fuller if you had sunk your teeth into a Big Mac back in the 1980s? At least that's what several posts on Facebook claim, which are currently being seen by thousands of users. The posts claim that the burger has shrunk significantly in size , while at the same time increasing significantly in price . The claim is widespread in both Danish and English Facebook posts . One of the English posts has 29,000 shares , while another has been shared more than 9,000 times . Some of the posts claim that the burger has become 40 percent smaller . As documentation, many of the posts use the same image, which shows two Big Macs. One is supposedly from the 1980s, while the other is from 2024. If the image is to be believed, then there is a significant size difference. This image is repeated in numerous posts, where it is claimed that McDonald's Big Mac has shrunk significantly since the happy 80s (Photo: Screenshot of Facebook). But while it might take two Big Macs to cure your hangover today, it wouldn't have been any different in the 1980s According to TjekDet's research, there is no indication that the Big Mac has shrunk since the 1980s. However, it has increased in price - although not very much if you take inflation into account. The price increase According to an article from the Pennsylvania Center for the Book, the Big Mac was first introduced in the 1960s by Jim Delligatti, who owned a number of McDonald's restaurants in Pittsburgh, USA. In 1968, the Big Mac was added to the menu at all McDonald's restaurants in the United States. And the price? It was 45 cents. If you use an inflation converter to calculate what 45 cents in 1968 is worth today, the answer is just over $4. Today, a Big Mac in the USA costs $5.69 - equivalent to just over 40 Danish kroner, while the normal price in Denmark is 39 kroner for one of the popular burgers. From country to country, there is virtually no difference in what a Big Mac looks like. That is why the media outlet “The Economist” has published  the “Big Mac Index” since 1986 as a way to compare price levels across borders and currencies. In 2024,  “The Economist” has calculated that Switzerland will have the world's most expensive Big Mac with a price of $8.17 - equivalent to about 58 Danish kroner. But what about the size? The price is one thing, but what happened to the size of the Big Mac? Some of the posts on social media claim that the burger has become 40 percent smaller since 1980. If you ask McDonald's press department in Denmark, they flatly deny that the Big Mac has changed size. “The size of Big Mac's has not changed since McDonald's came to Denmark in 1981. We are not allowed to do that at all,” says Mads Jensen, a communications officer at McDonald's. Today, McDonald's Danish website states that a Big Mac contains 510 calories. If you look at the American version , it contains 590 calories. But on neither the Danish nor the American website can you see how much a Big Mac weighs. Therefore, TjekDet bought three Big Mac's at three different McDonald's restaurants in Copenhagen and here the weight was 200 grams, 206 grams and 222 grams. By using the Wayback Machine, which is an internet archiving tool, TjekDet has managed to find the content description for a Big Mac in Denmark back in 2001 . Back then, a Big Mac weighed 209 grams and contained 2137 kJ, which corresponds to 511 calories. In terms of both weight and calories, the Big Mac is basically the same today as it was more than 20 years ago, so you shouldn't feel cheated when you sink your teeth into a Big Mac in 2025. However, the number of calories has varied a little. In 2019, McDonald's website stated that there were 503 calories in a Big Mac, while in 2022 there were 487 calories - and as previously mentioned - today there are 510 calories in one of the popular burgers.  In 2020, McDonald's in Denmark had a turnover of 2.7 billion kroner, McDonald's writes on its own website. Photo: Shutterstock More calories in Everything is bigger in the USA sounds like a cool phrase, but when it comes to Big Macs, there isn't much difference between Denmark and the USA. For Big Macs in the US, there are significantly more content designations to dig up than in recent decades, and there is nothing to suggest that the Big Mac has shrunk in size. The biggest difference from Denmark is the number of calories, which is generally higher in the US than in Denmark. In 1996 we can see that there were 530 calories in an American Big Mac , so there are actually more calories in the burger in 2025 than back then - namely 590 calories. In 2003, we can see that the burger weighed 216 grams, which is roughly consistent with the results that TjekDet obtained. Even though we can't go back any further than 1996 for the USA and 2001 for Denmark, there is no documentation that the popular burger has become smaller.;https://www-tjekdet-dk.translate.goog/faktatjek/er-din-big-mac-blevet-markant-mindre-siden-1980erne?_x_tr_sl=da&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=fr&_x_tr_pto=wapp
FC_12;Assertion;Is it true that over half of Ukrainians would give up land for peace?;Assertion The majority of the Ukrainian population now says, according to Gallup, that they want an end to the war. They want peace negotiations, cede territories, rather than continue this war. Conclusion It is true, according to the 2024 poll, that 52 percent of the population wants peace negotiations to end the war as soon as possible. However, it is not true that half the population wants to cede territories. The survey only asked respondents who already wanted peace negotiations whether they were open to ceding territories. Here again, 52 percent answered yes.;"This is the fact-check: During NRK's ​​""Debatten"" on May 20, the leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), Marielle Leraand, brought up an opinion poll conducted by the American analysis agency Gallup . The agency regularly conducts surveys in Ukraine as part of its World Poll .Leraand claimed that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country.We have reviewed the numbers to find out if her claim is true.It is true that over half (52 percent) of those surveyed said they wanted Ukraine to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible.However, it is not true that the majority have said they want to give up land. The survey only asked the question of whether Ukraine should give up land to those who responded that they wanted peace negotiations. Of these, 52 percent responded that they wanted to give up land in negotiations. 38 percent responded that they did not want this, and nine percent were unsure or refrained from answering.When asked first whether Ukraine should negotiate or continue fighting, 38 percent said the country should continue fighting until it wins the war. This is a decrease from Gallup's previous surveys from 2023 and 2022. In 2022, 73 percent were in favor of continuing to fight, and 63 percent said the same in 2023.Both VG and NRK have investigated several of the allegations that emerged during the Debate.The Gallup poll was conducted in August and October 2024, with the figures published in November of the same year. It is reported that the agency is unable to conduct the surveys in occupied territories due to lack of coverage by Ukrainian telecom operators. This means that approximately 10–12 percent of the population is excluded from the surveys.The agency has regularly conducted surveys in Ukraine. In an article, they explain the challenges involved in conducting surveys in a war zone .Professor at the Department of Political Science at the University of Oslo, Jørgen Bølstad, tells Faktisk.no that even though the surveys were conducted in a country at war, we can read something from them.Bølstad also explains that there is consistency between the surveys from Gallup and other surveys, including those from the Kyiv Institute of Sociology  (KIIS).– Findings from KIIS indicate that around 38 percent are willing to give up land to get a quick peace agreement, while 51 percent are not, says Bølstad.– This also illustrates that the wording of the questions is absolutely crucial. It is not surprising that a people at war can imagine peace. The big question is what kind of peace they want, and at what price. It is unlikely that many people want the West to stop sending aid.He also says that it is important to take into account that the surveys were conducted a few months ago, and that things may have changed in the meantime.– Difficult to explain all the detailsFOR leader Marielle Leraand writes in an email to Faktisk.no that the format of the Debate made it difficult to explain all the details of the survey.– The answer options in the survey were “Ukraine should continue fighting until it wins the war”. 38 percent thought this. The Norwegian public has created the impression that an overwhelming majority of Ukrainians will continue to fight.– But 52 percent thought that: “Ukraine should seek to negotiate an ending to the war as soon as possible”. That is what we in FOR think. We do not have a specific opinion about what the negotiation result should be.";https://www-faktisk-no.translate.goog/faktasjekk/stemmer-det-at-over-halvparten-av-ukrainere-vil-gi-fra-seg-land-for-fred/125465?_x_tr_sl=no&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=fr&_x_tr_pto=wapp
FC_13;Assertion;Claims that ski wax pollutes Oslo's drinking water;Assertion:In areas where a lot of ski lubrication is used, there is extra PFAS (a type of synthetic substance). It ends up in Maridalsvannet and is not cleaned. I can guarantee you that the water you get from the tap contains a lot of crap.Thomas Thrap Huse (Pimp Lotion), republished by @vannrenser.no on TikTokConclusion:The drinking water in Oslo undergoes rigorous testing, is monitored weekly, and meets all requirements of the Drinking Water Regulations. It is safe to drink, and a water filter is not necessary. PFAS can occur in drinking water, but the levels are well below safe limits.;"According to influencer and artist Thomas Thrap Huse (Pimp Lotion), and the company Vannrenser.no, Oslo's drinking water from Maridalen is so polluted that we are advised to purchase a water filter to purify our drinking water. TikTok user @vannrenser.no is apparently advertising the website of the same name , where you can purchase the filters. According to the website, the so-called reverse osmosis filter is supposed to remove absolutely all contaminants, which in turn can lead to increased energy levels and help us get rid of brain fog. The website Vannrenser.no mentions the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) several times on its website. Faktisk.no has obtained access to emails between Vannrenser.no and FHI, in which the latter asks the company to moderate the references on its website and remove the FHI logo. Get Faktisk.no straight to your inbox.  Click here to sign up for our weekly newsletter . This is what one of the places on the website Vannrenser.no looks like where FHI's name is used. Screenshot Vannrenser.noFollowing the email correspondence, Vannrenser.no has moderated the text somewhat and they have removed the logo and instead written FHI in capital letters - along with other logos.As Marianne Steinberg, senior advisor at FHI, sees it, the company has not complied with FHI's requirements. – In the correspondence a few months ago, FHI asked the website to remove the reference to us through the logo and previous comments on some of Vannrenser.no's professional content that FHI believes gives the wrong impression of what they inform about, says Steinberg. Steinberg clarifies above Faktisk.no what FHI's advice regarding drinking water is:  – It is not necessary to purify drinking water from a waterworks with a filter or other post-treatment. The vast majority of people get their drinking water from a waterworks, which treats the water so that it is safe to drink. But could there be something to be said for a water filter like Pimp Lotion claims in the video posted by the company? The user @vannrenser.no on TikTok uses a clip of Thomas Thrap Huse talking about water quality and water filtration. Screenshot TikTokTests weekly– The drinking water in Oslo, including from Maridalsvannet, is safe and meets all requirements in the drinking water regulations . This is what Toril Giske, functional manager for water quality at the Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration, tells Faktisk.no. She explains that they conduct frequent tests to ensure that the quality of drinking water is always high.– The claims made in the podcast do not provide a balanced or fact-based picture of water quality in Oslo. The Water and Wastewater Agency relies on extensive monitoring and scientific documentation to ensure that the drinking water supplied to Oslo's population is safe and good. She adds: The Norwegian Institute of Public Health:These are PFASPFAS are a large group of man-made synthetic substances, of which there are approximately 10,000.PFAS have been used for over 50 years in a variety of products, including food packaging, non-stick coatings for pots and pans, textile impregnation agents, fire-fighting foams, cleaning products, cosmetics, paints, varnishes and some types of ski lubricants. In addition, fire-fighting foams have been found to be an important source of PFAS in the environment in Norway.PFAS are not produced in Norway. Everything that is traded is imported, either in the form of chemical-technical products or as a component in solid processed products.PFAS are widely distributed in the environment. Animals at the top of the food chain have higher amounts of a number of these substances in their bodies than animals further down the food chain.Source: NIPH and NIVA– This involves weekly sampling at the water treatment plants and in the pipeline network. This is done in accordance with the requirements set for water utility owners in the Drinking Water Regulations.– Found everywhereIn the aforementioned podcast, Thomas Thrap Huse focuses particularly on PFAS (see fact box) in drinking water as one of the main reasons why he believes it is wise to use a reverse osmosis filter. PFAS are substances that are very stable and are therefore referred to as ""forever chemicals."" Cathrine Brecke Gundersen, who researches environmental chemicals at the Norwegian Institute for Water Research (NIVA), tells Faktisk.no. “PFAS are often added to the surface of a product and can be washed off during use and washing. Because PFAS have so many different uses, we find the substances almost everywhere, both outdoors and indoors,” says Gundersen.She points out that virtually all people have PFASs in their blood because some of these substances are found almost everywhere. We do not have thorough data on the harmful effects of all types of PFAS, but several types have been linked to harmful effects that can, among other things, disrupt the immune system, reduce the effectiveness of vaccines, inhibit fetal development and be carcinogenic. Very low levelsThe level of PFAS in drinking water has recently been investigated in Southern Norway, including in Maridalsvannet. Cathrine Brecke Gundersen has a PhD in environmental chemistry and is a researcher at the Norwegian Institute for Water Resources (NIVA). Photo: NIVA. – Not surprisingly, PFAS was found, but at low levels that are below the most stringent international drinking water limits. PFAS in drinking water from public waterworks in southern parts of Norway is low and therefore drinking water is not considered a significant source,  says Gundersen.This is also confirmed by Toril Giske from the Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration. At the same time, she says that it is true that PFAS can be found in some types of ski lubricant: – We regularly monitor water quality and analyze, among other things, for PFAS, which can be found in certain types of ski lubricant. When it comes to PFAS, we analyze quarterly for 17 different compounds at both of our raw water sources, Maridalsvannet and Elvåga. According to Giske, none of these compounds were detected in samples taken at Elvåga in 2024. – In samples from Maridalsvannet, we have found a few of these (3 out of 17), but these are very low values that are well below the prescribed limit value for PFAS compounds in the new drinking water regulations. Giske tells Faktisk.no that the water quality is safe and is continuously monitored.Drinking water not the main sourceShe says that the most important source of PFAS for humans is the food we eat. This is also stated by the EU's EFSA, which carries out risk assessments on the levels of PFAS that humans can ingest. Cathrine Brecke Gundersen at NIVA therefore believes that it is generally not necessary to use a reverse osmosis filter in Norway. – To reduce exposure to PFAS, it is recommended to be aware of which products you buy and surround yourself with. Products marked with the Nordic Ecolabel guarantee to be free of PFAS, says Gundersen.The researcher believes that places where such a filter might be appropriate are at private water sources, such as a well, located near a firefighting training area or at places where PFAS has previously been produced. But Gundersen adds that the water utility is responsible for ensuring that public water supplies are of sufficiently good quality.";https://www-faktisk-no.translate.goog/faktasjekk/hevder-at-skismoring-forurenser-oslos-drikkevann/125261?_x_tr_sl=no&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=fr&_x_tr_pto=wapp

FC_15;Lead;The Swedish Diabetes Association is being exploited to sell fraudulent anti-obesity drugs;The Swedish Diabetes Association is being used in scam ads where the scammers claim to have a miracle cure for weight loss. “Total fake,” says Fredrik Nyström, professor of internal medicine at Linköping University.;"This is the fact-check :A Facebook page claiming to be the Swedish Diabetes Association has posted a before and after photo along with a sad story about two sisters.In the first photo, they are sitting on a sofa with a friend and smiling at the camera. In the second photo, one of the sisters has been replaced by a photo. She has died, only 52 years old.According to the story, the sisters have struggled with their weight for a long time.Kajsa and I have always been the big girls. ""Even in school we knew how to pose to look slimmer - to hold our shirts in front of our stomachs.People said: ""You have such a beautiful face.""And we pretended not to hear.I remember when Kajsa was tying her shoes at Target, and could barely breathe when she got up.She laughed it off: ""I'm just old.""I laughed along, but something inside me froze.Then the call came. I was in the grocery store buying toilet paper.Diana called. ""Kajsa fainted. Heart attack. She passed out.""But, writes the ""Diabetesf�rbundet"", with the help of a dietary supplement, the remaining sister managed to lose weight and in the after picture she really does look slimmer.The post has received over 1,200 likes in two weeks.For anyone who clicks on “Diabetesf�rbundet” and examines the Facebook page, it superficially looks like it could belong to the real Swedish Diabetes Association.There are Swedish address and contact details and the link leads to the real association's website . However, the scammers have only made a copy. Their Facebook page has just over 900 followers and if you search Facebook's search function for Diabetesförbundet you will find the real organization, with 16,000 followers.The Swedish Diabetes Association neither recommends, certifies nor endorses products, services or medicines, writes Bjørn Ehlin, chairman of the real interest organization, to the Source Criticism Agency:In 2025, we have seen an increase in the number of advertisements on social media where advertisers use the names and logos of various organizations and authorities without permission, including the Swedish Diabetes Association and the Swedish Medical Products Agency.We take seriously the creation of accounts and pages on social media with our name and logo, as well as websites We take seriously the creation of accounts and pages on social media with our name and logo, as well as websites/online shops that use our name, logo and material from our website with the aim of making the visitor/buyer believe that we are behind it.We would like to urge everyone to be attentive and critical of the source when they see advertisements on social media. Advertisements with claims that “seem too good to be true” are usually that.From an email from the Swedish Diabetes AssociationThe link that the scammers want you to click on leads to a site with the Swedish Diabetes Association's logo. There you are offered to buy ten bottles of the dietary supplement for 700 kronor and are promised a weight loss of 60 kilos.Scam site.The image of the women appears to have been created using AI and has not been published elsewhere online. Here's our guide on how to investigate a suspicious Facebook post !Fake profiles pepper the comments sectionIn the comments section, there are many people who confirm the weight loss claims and post before and after pictures of themselves. However, if you search with, for example, Google's image search function Lens, it turns out that the pictures are taken from various weight loss success stories online.""Look at me! I've really lost weight! This picture says more than I can ever explain,"" writes a woman who is said to be called Maja Karlsson and lives in Borlänge.Fake profile on Facebook.But Maja's before and after photo belongs to a woman in another part of the world who in April shared her weight loss with the help of the drug Mounjaro on the Reddit forum.Search with Google Lens.Maja's Facebook profile only contains a picture of herself, an illustration, and her friends appear to be from various Asian countries.The same goes for ""Elin Andersson"" who claims in the thread that she got amazing results for a cheap price. Even her before and after pictures are stolen from Reddit.Comment on Facebook June 4.The “cloned” page is controlled from Hong Kong and China, among other places, which may explain why the fake profiles have a “friendship” exclusively from Asian countries.When examining the Facebook page further, it is also discovered that it was started in 2023 as “The KING Photography”, and changed its name to “Diabetesförbundet” only in April this year.From the page transparency section of the scammers' Facebook page.Here you will learn more about how to check out a Facebook page and its ads .Can a pill make you lose weight?The answer is yes, there is – but no, this product that the scammers want to sell you does not have those properties.– There are no dietary supplements that have these effects, it is a total fake, says Fredrik Nyström, a professor who researches risk factors for cardiovascular disease, obesity and diabetes at Linköping University.He is supported by Professor Åke Lernmark, senior professor in experimental diabetes at Lund University.– After many years of miracle pills, we have all learned that dietary supplements such as pills do not lead to weight loss, he tells Källkritikbyrån.However, there are now medications where patients lose weight using pills or injections.More scam ads from the same sender on Facebook.The fake drug in the ad is said to have the same mechanics as the high-profile drugs that have appeared in recent years, which regulate blood sugar and affect hunger signals to the brain.But Fredrik Nyström dismisses the idea that this dietary supplement would have those properties.– If it existed, it would be as well-known as possible. There is no chance that pharmaceutical companies would miss a preparation that is just a dietary supplement or some natural product, they would have bought it up a long time ago. You can always just count on it being fake if it is claimed that you will lose 20 kilos with this dietary supplement.Nyström is concerned that the fake ads are spreading and that the fraudsters are using increasingly technologically advanced methods.– It's a new and difficult chapter. People are really going for it!Åke Lernmark at Lund University thinks the hoax campaign is regrettable.– It's tragic that so many are easily fooled and that manufacturers of dietary supplements are more or less unscrupulous.More scam ads from the same sender on Facebook.Björn Ehlin, chairman of the Swedish Diabetes Association, urges you to talk to your doctor.– It is claimed that it does not affect other medications, but there is always a risk that dietary supplements can have an impact depending on the content and which medication you are taking. So you should always check with your doctor whether the particular dietary supplement you are thinking of taking has an impact on the medications you are taking.Uses experts and authoritiesThe fake “Diabetesförbundet” has had 18 active ad campaigns on Facebook since the beginning of May, with various made-up stories and stolen images.Several public figures, such as various Swedish heart and obesity researchers, and Olivia Wigzell, Director General of the Public Health Agency, have been exploited by the scammers in the ads.Fake profile on Facebook.Fredrik Nyström, a professor at Linköping University, has himself been affected.– They have faked advertisements with me that are very similar to this theme. “For this many hundreds a month you will lose this much weight”. And that's me in the picture, there are even films sometimes.Källkritikbyrån has previously reported on how Lars Wallentin, a senior professor of cardiology in Uppsala, was deep-faked, i.e. remade with AI in a film .
