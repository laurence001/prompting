FC_01;Bullet point summary;Story of wolf and scared boys reaches Christiansborg Palace. But it's a cat, experts say; 1. Two schoolboys from Esbjerg had to sit scared in a tree for an hour and a half, hiding from a wolf that was circling below them. 2. JydskeVestkysten writes this in an article, where they also include the boys' own video recording of the animal.3. The incident has sparked a lot of debate on social media and among politicians. But according to experts, it wasn't a wolf at all that the boys encountered, but a big cat. ;Two boys aged 11 and 12 from Esbjerg had an experience on Thursday last week that made them really scared. While they were killing time climbing trees near their school, they suddenly saw a wolf approaching. The boys climbed four meters up the tree, where they had to wait for an hour and a half while the wolf circled below them.  This is reported by JydskeVestkysten , which also publishes a video of the roaming predator that the boys have recorded.  The article is being widely shared on social media, where it is overflowing with comments from people who are angry and outraged that the wolf is getting so close to children. The story has even reached Christiansborg Palace.  The Danish People's Party shares the story on X with the message of regaining security, and Liberal Party member of parliament Anni Matthiesen reports on Facebook about the boys' experience.  The same is done by the Social Democratic member of parliament Anders Kronborg on Facebook, where he writes that “HUMANS come before WOLF”. Anders Kronborg is also a former city council member in Esbjerg Municipality, an open advocate for regulating wolves, and one of the two boys is his nephew. But it seems that it was not a wolf at all that the boys sought refuge from and filmed. JydskeVestkysten has also clarified their article and, among other things, changed the headline.  A Facebook user shares the video and points out that doubts have been raised about whether it is actually a wolf.Not a wolf, but a catTjekDet has been in contact with two of Denmark's leading wolf experts, who assess that it is not a wolf that appears in the boys' video recording of the incident. They both assess that it is another animal that the boys have seen. It is certainly not a wolf seen in the film. Judging from the animal's size and movements, it is a cat. Probably a long-haired one, says Peter Sunde, professor and wolf expert at the Department of Ecoscience at Aarhus University. Kent Olsen, wolf expert and scientific director of senior researchers at the Natural History Museum, makes the same assessment. I have seen the recording and read the article. The recording shows that it is a cat and not a wolf, writes Kent Olsen in an email to TjekDet. In addition to the video that the experts have reviewed and which, according to them, does not show a wolf, JydskeVestkysten also includes a picture in the article that allegedly comes from the video. The picture shows an animal that may well resemble a wolf. The caption states that the picture is a screenshot from the video recording that the boys took from the tree, and that the boys had no doubt that it was a wolf. Sign up for the CheckIt newsletter Louise Lauritsen, editor-in-chief and local editor of JydskeVestkysten in Esbjerg, informs TjekDet that the editorial staff did not take the screenshot from the boys' video themselves. The image was sent by the boys.  JydskeVestkysten has not wanted to release the boys' full-length recording to TjekDet, but says that they are in possession of it.  Following TjekDet's inquiry, JydskeVestkysten has provided a clarification in their article. “The headline of the article was changed on April 14th at 1:30 p.m. after several experts, whom JydskeVestkysten has spoken to, cast doubt on whether it was a wolf that scared the boys,” the media outlet now writes. They have also changed the headline from “Two boys sat up in a tree for an hour and a half while a wolf circled below them” to “Two boys sat up in a tree for an hour and a half out of fear of a wolf” . In an email to TjekDet, Louise Lauritsen acknowledges that JydskeVestkysten should have made more linguistic reservations in the article and not concluded that it was a wolf. She does not answer directly whether they still believe that it is most likely that the boys saw a wolf. Instead, she writes: “We have conveyed the boys' experience of being scared by a wolf. We perceive the children and their parents as credible sources and without alternative motive.” CheckedIs the wasp really more dangerous than the wolf? The original article also reports that the janitor at the nearby school also saw a wolf in the area the day after the two boys. JydskeVestkysten also clarifies this in the updated version. “The school janitor informs JydskeVestkysten that he has seen a dog-like animal in the area,” it now reads. They have also changed the caption to what is allegedly a screenshot from the two boys' video recording.

Claim being verified: The claim being verified is that two boys in Esbjerg, Denmark, were scared by a wolf, which they filmed while perched in a tree for an hour and a half. The boys were convinced it was a wolf, but experts are questioning this identification.2. Main evidence: The main evidence used to refute the claim is the video the boys recorded, which was reviewed by wolf experts. Two leading experts assessed the footage and determined that the animal in question was not a wolf but a cat, likely a long-haired one. Additionally, the boys' description and the image they sent to the media were examined, and the media outlet later updated the article based on expert feedback.3. Verdict: Mixed. The fact-checking reveals that the boys' fear was based on their perception of a wolf, but expert analysis suggests it was not a wolf. However, the clarification does not outright disprove the boys' experience, as they genuinely believed it was a wolf.

Claim being evaluated: The claim being evaluated is that two boys in Esbjerg, Denmark, were scared by a wolf they filmed while sitting in a tree for over an hour, as they believed the animal was a wolf circling below them. The central assertion is that the boys encountered a wolf.2. Main evidence provided: The key evidence used to assess the claim includes the video recorded by the boys, which was reviewed by two prominent wolf experts. Both experts—Peter Sunde, a professor at Aarhus University, and Kent Olsen, a director at the Natural History Museum—examined the footage and concluded that the animal in the video was not a wolf, but rather a long-haired cat. Furthermore, the media outlet, JydskeVestkysten, updated their article and clarified the situation based on expert opinions. The photo sent by the boys was also questioned, as it resembled a wolf, but experts asserted it could not definitively prove the presence of a wolf.3. Verdict: Mixed. The fact-check concludes that the claim that the boys encountered a wolf is false based on expert analysis, which identified the animal as a cat. However, the boys' belief that they saw a wolf is understood as genuine, given their reaction and the initial confusion. The media outlet updated its article to reflect expert opinions but did not fully dismiss the boys' experience, recognizing the fear they felt in the moment. Therefore, while the claim about the animal's identity is false, the boys' experience of fear is valid.;1. Identify the claim being evaluated:  The claim being evaluated is that two boys from Esbjerg encountered a wolf while climbing trees near their school. They allegedly filmed the wolf as it circled beneath them, and the incident was widely reported, with public outcry regarding the proximity of the wolf to the children.2. Review the key evidence provided to assess the claim:  - Expert Opinion: Two wolf experts, Peter Sunde and Kent Olsen, reviewed the video footage taken by the boys and both concluded that the animal in question was not a wolf but a cat, likely a long-haired one. This expert analysis directly contradicts the claim that the boys encountered a wolf.  - Media Clarification: After receiving input from experts, JydskeVestkysten, the news outlet that first reported the incident, updated its article. They changed the headline to reflect the uncertainty about the animal's identity, stating that the boys had feared a wolf but that experts disagreed with this assessment. The article acknowledged that it was not definitively a wolf.  - Witness Accounts: Despite expert analysis, the boys and the school janitor still believed they saw a wolf, and the media initially reported it as such. This belief reflects the fear and confusion of the witnesses, but it does not align with the expert assessments of the footage.3. Based on this evidence, determine whether the claim is True, False, or Mixed:  The final verdict is False.  Justification:  - The primary evidence against the claim is the expert analysis, which confirms that the animal in the footage is not a wolf but a cat. This directly contradicts the boys' belief and the initial report.  - The clarification by the media outlet further supports this conclusion, as they updated the article and headline to reflect the uncertainty about the animal's identity after consulting experts.  - While the boys and the school janitor believed the animal was a wolf, expert opinion is based on a thorough review of the footage, which led to the conclusion that the animal was not a wolf.Therefore, the claim that the boys encountered a wolf is False, as it is contradicted by expert analysis and subsequent media clarification.;Fact-Check: Boys' Wolf Encounter Debunked - Experts Say It Was a Cat (Verdict: False);1. Identify and explain the claim being evaluated:  The central claim being evaluated is that two boys in Esbjerg encountered a wolf while climbing trees near their school. The initial report by JydskeVestkysten presented this as a factual event, detailing how the boys were really scared and had to wait in a tree for an hour and a half as the wolf circled below. This claim triggered significant public reaction and even reached political circles.2. Examine the main evidence provided:  The primary evidence used to assess the claim comes from the expert analysis of the video recorded by the boys. Fact-checking organization TjekDet contacted two leading Danish wolf experts, Peter Sunde and Kent Olsen, who both independently reviewed the video. Their expert opinion was that the animal in the video was not a wolf but a long-haired cat, based on its size and movements. Additionally, JydskeVestkysten's own subsequent clarifications, including changing the headline and acknowledging expert doubts, serve as evidence against the initial claim. The fact that the newspaper did not directly take the screenshot included in their article from the video themselves, but received it from the boys, also suggests a potential for misinterpretation.3. Conclude with the verdict and key reasons:  The verdict of this fact-check is effectively False regarding the initial identification of the animal as a wolf. The key reasons for this verdict are:   Expert Identification: Two independent and highly qualified wolf experts explicitly stated that the animal in the boys' video is a cat, not a wolf, based on observable characteristics like size and movement.   News Outlet's Clarification: JydskeVestkysten itself revised its reporting by changing the headline and adding clarifications that experts doubt it was a wolf. This indicates an acknowledgment of the likely inaccuracy of the initial report.   Focus on the Boys' Experience: While the news outlet emphasizes the credibility of the boys' fear, they do not definitively maintain that the animal was a wolf, instead focusing on conveying the boys' emotional experience. This shift in framing supports the idea that the initial identification was likely incorrect.;Okay, let's break down this fact-check step by step to arrive at the verdict.1. Identify the claim being evaluated.  The central claim being evaluated is that two boys in Esbjerg had a frightening encounter with a wolf while climbing trees near their school, leading them to stay up in the tree for an hour and a half as the wolf circled below. This claim was initially reported by JydskeVestkysten and subsequently shared widely on social media, even drawing attention from politicians.2. Review the key evidence provided to assess the claim.  The key evidence includes:   The Boys' Account: The initial report from JydskeVestkysten details the boys' experience of seeing what they believed to be a wolf and feeling really scared. They recorded a video of the animal.   Video Footage: The existence of a video recorded by the boys is mentioned, and a screenshot allegedly from this video was included in the initial report.   Expert Analysis: Two leading Danish wolf experts independently reviewed the boys' video recording. Both concluded that the animal in the video is not a wolf, but rather a cat, likely a long-haired one, based on its size and movements.   News Outlet's Response: JydskeVestkysten has since updated their article. They changed the headline from explicitly stating a wolf was present to saying the boys were scared out of fear of a wolf. They also added a clarification noting that experts doubt it was a wolf.   Screenshot Origin: The news outlet clarified that they did not take the screenshot themselves, it was sent by the boys. The caption of the screenshot was also updated to reflect the experts' disagreement with the boys' identification.   Janitor's Account Revision: A report of a school janitor seeing a wolf in the area was changed to the janitor seeing a dog-like animal.   Lack of Full Video Access: The fact-checking organization, TjekDet, was not provided with the full-length video for independent analysis.   News Outlet's Stance: While acknowledging the experts' doubts, JydskeVestkysten states they perceive the children and their parents as credible sources regarding their feeling of being scared.3. Based on this evidence, determine whether the claim is True, False, or Mixed or another suitable verdict. Justify your decision with relevant facts.  The verdict for this fact-check is False.  Justification:  The overwhelming evidence from the expert analysis of the video directly contradicts the central claim that the boys encountered a wolf. Two independent and leading wolf experts identified the animal in the boys' own video recording as a cat based on its physical characteristics and behavior.  While the boys' experience of being scared is acknowledged by the news outlet, their identification of the animal as a wolf is not supported by the available visual evidence as analyzed by experts. The subsequent changes and clarifications made by JydskeVestkysten to their article and the image caption further indicate that the initial claim of a wolf encounter is likely inaccurate.  The fact that the core element of the story – the presence of a wolf – has been refuted by expert analysis of the primary evidence (the video) makes the initial claim demonstrably false, regardless of the boys' genuine fear or the news outlet's assessment of their credibility regarding their emotional experience.;Danish boys' 'wolf' encounter was actually a cat, experts say;1. Claim being evaluated:The claim being evaluated is that two boys in Esbjerg, Denmark were scared by a wolf that circled below them while they were climbing a tree. The core statement is that a wolf was present and caused the boys to be scared.2. Main evidence:The main evidence provided to assess the truthfulness of this claim includes:  A video recording taken by the boys, which has been reviewed by two of Denmark's leading wolf experts, Peter Sunde and Kent Olsen.  The experts' assessments that the animal in the video is not a wolf, but a cat, likely a long-haired one.  The media outlet's (JydskeVestkysten) own clarification and update of their article, which acknowledges that experts have cast doubt on whether the animal was a wolf.  A photo allegedly taken from the video, which was sent by the boys to the media outlet and may have contributed to the initial identification of the animal as a wolf.3. Verdict and justification:The verdict given in the fact-check is False. The reasons for this conclusion are:  The video recording, which shows an animal that experts identify as a cat, not a wolf.  The experts' assessments that the animal's size and movements are consistent with a cat, not a wolf.  The media outlet's own clarification and update of their article, which suggests that they may have been too quick to conclude that the animal was a wolf.  The fact that the boys and their parents may have misidentified the animal as a wolf, and that there is no conclusive evidence to support the claim that a wolf was present.Overall, the fact-check concludes that there is no evidence to support the claim that a wolf was present and scared the two boys, and that the animal in the video is more likely to be a cat.;Here are the steps to determine the verdict:1. Identify the claim being evaluated.The claim being evaluated is that two boys in Esbjerg, Denmark were scared by a wolf that circled below them while they were climbing a tree.2. Review the key evidence provided to assess the claim.The key evidence provided is a video recording taken by the boys, which was reviewed by two leading wolf experts, Peter Sunde and Kent Olsen. They concluded that the animal in the video is not a wolf, but a cat, likely a long-haired one.3. Based on this evidence, determine whether the claim is True, False, or Mixed or another suitable verdict. Justify your decision with relevant facts.Based on the evidence, the verdict is: FalseThe experts' assessment of the video recording provides strong evidence that the animal in question is a cat, not a wolf. This contradicts the boys' claim that they were scared by a wolf. There is no evidence to suggest that a wolf was present, and the experts' conclusion is based on a visual assessment of the video recording. Therefore, the claim is considered false.The verdict is not Mixed because there is no ambiguity or uncertainty in the evidence. The experts' conclusion is clear and direct, and it directly contradicts the boys' claim. There is no evidence to support the claim that a wolf was present, and therefore, the claim is considered false;Experts Debunk Claim of Wolf Stalking Boys in Esbjerg: It Was a Cat;1. Identifying and Explaining the Claim Being EvaluatedThe claim being evaluated is that two boys, aged 11 and 12, in Esbjerg, Denmark, encountered a wolf that circled below them for an hour and a half while they were hiding in a tree, as reported by the news outlet JydskeVestkysten. This core assertion suggests that a wolf, a wild predator, was present and posed a threat to the boys, prompting them to climb a tree out of fear and record the animal.2. Examining the Main Evidence Provided to Assess the ClaimThe fact-check presents several pieces of evidence to assess the truthfulness of the claim:  Video Footage Analysis: The boys recorded a video of the animal, which was reviewed by two leading wolf experts in Denmark: Peter Sunde, a professor at Aarhus University’s Department of Ecoscience, and Kent Olsen, scientific director at the Natural History Museum. Both experts independently concluded that the animal in the video was not a wolf but a cat, likely long-haired, based on its size and movements.  Screenshot from the Video: JydskeVestkysten published a screenshot allegedly from the boys’ video, which depicted an animal resembling a wolf. However, the outlet clarified that this image was provided by the boys, not directly extracted by the editorial staff, raising questions about its authenticity or context.  Updated Reporting by JydskeVestkysten: Following inquiries from TjekDet, JydskeVestkysten revised their article on April 14, changing the headline from stating a wolf was present to reflecting the boys’ fear of a wolf. They also noted that a school janitor, initially reported to have seen a wolf, described seeing a “dog-like animal” instead. The outlet acknowledged to TjekDet that they should have used more cautious language and not concluded it was a wolf.  Context of Wolf Sightings: While wolves have been sighted in Denmark, including in nearby Varde Municipality, this does not directly support the claim of a wolf in this specific incident, as the evidence points to a different animal.3. Concluding with the Verdict and JustificationsVerdict: FalseThe fact-check concludes that the claim of the boys encountering a wolf is false. The key reasons justifying this verdict are:  Expert Consensus: The definitive assessment by two wolf experts, based on the boys’ video, confirmed that the animal was a cat, not a wolf. Their expertise in wolf behavior and physical characteristics provides strong evidence against the claim.  JydskeVestkysten’s Revisions: The outlet’s updates to the article, including the headline change and clarification about the janitor’s sighting, reflect acknowledgment of the expert findings and retract the initial assertion of a wolf’s presence. Their admission of insufficient caution in the original reporting further undermines the claim.  Ambiguity of the Screenshot: The screenshot’s unclear origin and its reliance on the boys’ submission, rather than direct verification by the outlet, weaken its reliability as evidence of a wolf.  Boys’ Credible Fear vs. Misidentification: While the boys’ fear and belief that they saw a wolf are acknowledged as genuine, the expert analysis indicates a misidentification, likely due to the cat’s appearance or the boys’ unfamiliarity with wolves.  This combination of expert testimony, revised reporting, and questionable secondary evidence supports the conclusion that the animal was not a wolf, rendering the original claim false.;1. Claim Being Evaluated:The claim is that two boys, aged 11 and 12, in Esbjerg, Denmark, encountered a wolf that circled below them for an hour and a half while they hid in a tree, as reported by JydskeVestkysten.2. Key Evidence Provided:  Expert Analysis: Two wolf experts, Peter Sunde (Aarhus University) and Kent Olsen (Natural History Museum), reviewed the boys’ video and concluded the animal was a cat, likely long-haired, based on its size and movements.  Screenshot Uncertainty: JydskeVestkysten published a screenshot, allegedly from the video, resembling a wolf, but it was provided by the boys and not directly verified by the outlet.  Media Revisions: JydskeVestkysten updated their article, changing the headline to reflect the boys’ fear rather than a confirmed wolf, noting a janitor saw a “dog-like animal,” and admitting to TjekDet they should have been more cautious in claiming it was a wolf.3. Verdict and Justification:Verdict: False.The claim is false because expert analysis conclusively identified the animal as a cat, not a wolf, based on the video evidence. The unverified screenshot’s questionable origin and JydskeVestkysten’s revisions, including their acknowledgment of premature conclusions, further support this finding. The boys’ fear was genuine, but the evidence indicates they misidentified a cat, likely due to unfamiliarity or the animal’s appearance, making the claim of a wolf encounter incorrect.
FC_01;Bullet point summary;Story of wolf and scared boys reaches Christiansborg Palace. But it's a cat, experts say; 1. Two schoolboys from Esbjerg had to sit scared in a tree for an hour and a half, hiding from a wolf that was circling below them. 2. JydskeVestkysten writes this in an article, where they also include the boys' own video recording of the animal.3. The incident has sparked a lot of debate on social media and among politicians. But according to experts, it wasn't a wolf at all that the boys encountered, but a big cat. ;Two boys aged 11 and 12 from Esbjerg had an experience on Thursday last week that made them really scared. While they were killing time climbing trees near their school, they suddenly saw a wolf approaching. The boys climbed four meters up the tree, where they had to wait for an hour and a half while the wolf circled below them.  This is reported by JydskeVestkysten , which also publishes a video of the roaming predator that the boys have recorded.  The article is being widely shared on social media, where it is overflowing with comments from people who are angry and outraged that the wolf is getting so close to children. The story has even reached Christiansborg Palace.  The Danish People's Party shares the story on X with the message of regaining security, and Liberal Party member of parliament Anni Matthiesen reports on Facebook about the boys' experience.  The same is done by the Social Democratic member of parliament Anders Kronborg on Facebook, where he writes that “HUMANS come before WOLF”. Anders Kronborg is also a former city council member in Esbjerg Municipality, an open advocate for regulating wolves, and one of the two boys is his nephew. But it seems that it was not a wolf at all that the boys sought refuge from and filmed. JydskeVestkysten has also clarified their article and, among other things, changed the headline.  A Facebook user shares the video and points out that doubts have been raised about whether it is actually a wolf.Not a wolf, but a catTjekDet has been in contact with two of Denmark's leading wolf experts, who assess that it is not a wolf that appears in the boys' video recording of the incident. They both assess that it is another animal that the boys have seen. It is certainly not a wolf seen in the film. Judging from the animal's size and movements, it is a cat. Probably a long-haired one, says Peter Sunde, professor and wolf expert at the Department of Ecoscience at Aarhus University. Kent Olsen, wolf expert and scientific director of senior researchers at the Natural History Museum, makes the same assessment. I have seen the recording and read the article. The recording shows that it is a cat and not a wolf, writes Kent Olsen in an email to TjekDet. In addition to the video that the experts have reviewed and which, according to them, does not show a wolf, JydskeVestkysten also includes a picture in the article that allegedly comes from the video. The picture shows an animal that may well resemble a wolf. The caption states that the picture is a screenshot from the video recording that the boys took from the tree, and that the boys had no doubt that it was a wolf. Sign up for the CheckIt newsletter Louise Lauritsen, editor-in-chief and local editor of JydskeVestkysten in Esbjerg, informs TjekDet that the editorial staff did not take the screenshot from the boys' video themselves. The image was sent by the boys.  JydskeVestkysten has not wanted to release the boys' full-length recording to TjekDet, but says that they are in possession of it.  Following TjekDet's inquiry, JydskeVestkysten has provided a clarification in their article. “The headline of the article was changed on April 14th at 1:30 p.m. after several experts, whom JydskeVestkysten has spoken to, cast doubt on whether it was a wolf that scared the boys,” the media outlet now writes. They have also changed the headline from “Two boys sat up in a tree for an hour and a half while a wolf circled below them” to “Two boys sat up in a tree for an hour and a half out of fear of a wolf” . In an email to TjekDet, Louise Lauritsen acknowledges that JydskeVestkysten should have made more linguistic reservations in the article and not concluded that it was a wolf. She does not answer directly whether they still believe that it is most likely that the boys saw a wolf. Instead, she writes: “We have conveyed the boys' experience of being scared by a wolf. We perceive the children and their parents as credible sources and without alternative motive.” CheckedIs the wasp really more dangerous than the wolf? The original article also reports that the janitor at the nearby school also saw a wolf in the area the day after the two boys. JydskeVestkysten also clarifies this in the updated version. “The school janitor informs JydskeVestkysten that he has seen a dog-like animal in the area,” it now reads. They have also changed the caption to what is allegedly a screenshot from the two boys' video recording. They (the boys, ed.) had no doubt that this was a wolf, but experts do not agree, JydskeVestkysten has now added to the description. TjekDet has tried unsuccessfully to get in touch with the boys and their parents. CheckedViral appeal is good enough: A fallen sheep can die if it is not helped upWolves on Danish soilAlthough it is in all likelihood not a wolf that the boys have videotaped, wolves have been seen before to come close to people - even in cities.This happened earlier in April, when JydskeVestkysten reported a story about a wolf that had visited Tistrup and Ansager in Varde Municipality on a Saturday. Shortly before, Oksbøl, which is also located in Varde Municipality, had also had a wolf visit.If you like TjekDet's articles and want to make sure you don't miss the latest, follow us on Facebook by clicking here .

The Claim: The claim being assessed is that two boys in Esbjerg, Denmark, were frightened by a wolf while climbing trees near their school. The boys recorded a video of the animal and believed it was a wolf circling beneath them.2. The Evidence: The main evidence includes the video recorded by the boys, which was analyzed by two wolf experts, Peter Sunde and Kent Olsen. Both experts concluded that the animal in the video was not a wolf but a long-haired cat. Additionally, the media outlet JydskeVestkysten revised their article after consulting experts, changing the headline and clarifying that the animal might not have been a wolf. The boys’ description of the incident and their belief that they saw a wolf were also considered in the fact-check.3. The Verdict: Mixed. The claim that the boys encountered a wolf is false based on expert analysis, which identified the animal as a cat. However, the boys' fear and belief in encountering a wolf is understood as genuine. The updated media article acknowledges the boys' experience while correcting the misidentification of the animal.;1. What is the claim being assessed?  The claim being assessed is that two boys from Esbjerg encountered a wolf while climbing trees near their school. The boys reportedly climbed the tree to escape the animal, which they believed to be a wolf, and filmed it while waiting for it to leave.2. What is the verdict (True;Fact-Check: Boys' Wolf Scare Debunked - Experts Identify Animal as Cat (Verdict: False);1. The Claim: The initial claim, reported by JydskeVestkysten, was that two boys in Esbjerg were really scared after encountering a wolf while climbing trees, forcing them to stay up the tree for an hour and a half as it circled below. This event garnered significant social media and political attention.2. The Evidence: The main evidence used to evaluate this claim is the expert analysis of the video recorded by the boys. Two leading Danish wolf experts independently reviewed the video and concluded that the animal shown was a long-haired cat, based on its size and movements, and not a wolf. Additionally, JydskeVestkysten itself issued a clarification, changed its headline, and acknowledged doubts from experts regarding the initial identification.3. The Verdict: The implicit verdict is False regarding the identification of the animal as a wolf. The rationale is based on the unanimous assessment of two wolf experts who identified the animal in the video as a cat. The news outlet's subsequent revisions to their reporting further support the conclusion that the boys likely misidentified the animal.;Alright, having carefully read the fact-check, here's the final verdict:1. What is the claim being assessed?  The primary claim being assessed is that two boys in Esbjerg, Denmark, were frightened by a wolf while climbing trees and had to remain there for an hour and a half as the wolf circled below them. This claim, based on the boys' experience and their video recording, was initially reported by JydskeVestkysten and gained significant attention.2. What is the verdict?  The verdict is False.3. What reasoning or evidence supports this decision?  The verdict of False is strongly supported by the following reasoning and evidence presented in the fact-check:   Expert Identification: Two independent, leading wolf experts in Denmark reviewed the video recorded by the boys. Both experts concluded that the animal in the video is not a wolf but a cat, likely a long-haired one, based on its size and movements. This directly contradicts the boys' initial identification and the premise of the original claim.   News Outlet's Correction: JydskeVestkysten, the original publisher of the story, has since issued a clarification and significantly altered its reporting. The headline was changed to reflect doubt about the animal being a wolf, and the article now includes the experts' assessment. This indicates that the initial reporting, which supported the claim of a wolf encounter, was inaccurate.   Revised Accounts: The account of a school janitor also changed from seeing a wolf to seeing a dog-like animal, further undermining the initial narrative of a wolf in the area. The caption of the image allegedly from the video was also updated to acknowledge the experts' disagreement.  While the fact-check acknowledges the boys' genuine experience of being scared and the news outlet considers them credible sources regarding their feelings, the objective evidence – the expert analysis of their own video – clearly indicates that the animal they encountered was not a wolf.

FC_01;Bullet point summary;Story of wolf and scared boys reaches Christiansborg Palace. But it's a cat, experts say; 1. Two schoolboys from Esbjerg had to sit scared in a tree for an hour and a half, hiding from a wolf that was circling below them. 2. JydskeVestkysten writes this in an article, where they also include the boys' own video recording of the animal.3. The incident has sparked a lot of debate on social media and among politicians. But according to experts, it wasn't a wolf at all that the boys encountered, but a big cat. ;Two boys aged 11 and 12 from Esbjerg had an experience on Thursday last week that made them really scared. While they were killing time climbing trees near their school, they suddenly saw a wolf approaching. The boys climbed four meters up the tree, where they had to wait for an hour and a half while the wolf circled below them.  This is reported by JydskeVestkysten , which also publishes a video of the roaming predator that the boys have recorded.  The article is being widely shared on social media, where it is overflowing with comments from people who are angry and outraged that the wolf is getting so close to children. The story has even reached Christiansborg Palace.  The Danish People's Party shares the story on X with the message of regaining security, and Liberal Party member of parliament Anni Matthiesen reports on Facebook about the boys' experience.  The same is done by the Social Democratic member of parliament Anders Kronborg on Facebook, where he writes that “HUMANS come before WOLF”. Anders Kronborg is also a former city council member in Esbjerg Municipality, an open advocate for regulating wolves, and one of the two boys is his nephew. But it seems that it was not a wolf at all that the boys sought refuge from and filmed. JydskeVestkysten has also clarified their article and, among other things, changed the headline.  A Facebook user shares the video and points out that doubts have been raised about whether it is actually a wolf.Not a wolf, but a catTjekDet has been in contact with two of Denmark's leading wolf experts, who assess that it is not a wolf that appears in the boys' video recording of the incident. They both assess that it is another animal that the boys have seen. It is certainly not a wolf seen in the film. Judging from the animal's size and movements, it is a cat. Probably a long-haired one, says Peter Sunde, professor and wolf expert at the Department of Ecoscience at Aarhus University. Kent Olsen, wolf expert and scientific director of senior researchers at the Natural History Museum, makes the same assessment. I have seen the recording and read the article. The recording shows that it is a cat and not a wolf, writes Kent Olsen in an email to TjekDet. In addition to the video that the experts have reviewed and which, according to them, does not show a wolf, JydskeVestkysten also includes a picture in the article that allegedly comes from the video. The picture shows an animal that may well resemble a wolf. The caption states that the picture is a screenshot from the video recording that the boys took from the tree, and that the boys had no doubt that it was a wolf. Sign up for the CheckIt newsletter Louise Lauritsen, editor-in-chief and local editor of JydskeVestkysten in Esbjerg, informs TjekDet that the editorial staff did not take the screenshot from the boys' video themselves. The image was sent by the boys.  JydskeVestkysten has not wanted to release the boys' full-length recording to TjekDet, but says that they are in possession of it.  Following TjekDet's inquiry, JydskeVestkysten has provided a clarification in their article. “The headline of the article was changed on April 14th at 1:30 p.m. after several experts, whom JydskeVestkysten has spoken to, cast doubt on whether it was a wolf that scared the boys,” the media outlet now writes. They have also changed the headline from “Two boys sat up in a tree for an hour and a half while a wolf circled below them” to “Two boys sat up in a tree for an hour and a half out of fear of a wolf” . In an email to TjekDet, Louise Lauritsen acknowledges that JydskeVestkysten should have made more linguistic reservations in the article and not concluded that it was a wolf. She does not answer directly whether they still believe that it is most likely that the boys saw a wolf. Instead, she writes: “We have conveyed the boys' experience of being scared by a wolf. We perceive the children and their parents as credible sources and without alternative motive.” CheckedIs the wasp really more dangerous than the wolf? The original article also reports that the janitor at the nearby school also saw a wolf in the area the day after the two boys. JydskeVestkysten also clarifies this in the updated version. “The school janitor informs JydskeVestkysten that he has seen a dog-like animal in the area,” it now reads. They have also changed the caption to what is allegedly a screenshot from the two boys' video recording. They (the boys, ed.) had no doubt that this was a wolf, but experts do not agree, JydskeVestkysten has now added to the description. TjekDet has tried unsuccessfully to get in touch with the boys and their parents. CheckedViral appeal is good enough: A fallen sheep can die if it is not helped upWolves on Danish soilAlthough it is in all likelihood not a wolf that the boys have videotaped, wolves have been seen before to come close to people - even in cities.This happened earlier in April, when JydskeVestkysten reported a story about a wolf that had visited Tistrup and Ansager in Varde Municipality on a Saturday. Shortly before, Oksbøl, which is also located in Varde Municipality, had also had a wolf visit.If you like TjekDet's articles and want to make sure you don't miss the latest, follow us on Facebook by clicking here .

Sign up for the newsletter here .;Role;Experts Debunk Claims of Wolf Encounter: Boys Likely Mistook Cat for Wolf in Viral Video;Claim: The claim being evaluated is that two boys in Esbjerg, Denmark, were scared by a wolf they filmed while sitting in a tree for an hour and a half.Evidence: The main evidence consists of a video recorded by the boys, which was reviewed by two wolf experts. Both experts, Peter Sunde and Kent Olsen, concluded that the animal in the video was not a wolf but a long-haired cat. The media outlet JydskeVestkysten updated its article after consulting these experts, changing its headline and clarifying that the animal might not have been a wolf. Despite this, the boys' belief that they encountered a wolf was considered genuine, as they were genuinely frightened by the animal.Verdict: Mixed. The claim that the boys encountered a wolf is false based on expert analysis, which identified the animal as a cat. However, the boys' fear and their belief that they saw a wolf are understood as genuine, so the fact-check recognizes the validity of their experience, even though the animal was misidentified.;1. Claim Being Assessed: The claim is that two boys from Esbjerg were scared by a wolf, which circled below them while they were climbing a tree. This incident was initially reported as involving a wolf, but later evidence raised doubts about the animal's identity.2. Final Verdict: Mixed.3. Explanation: The evidence shows that the boys’ experience of being scared by an animal while in a tree is credible, but the animal they encountered was likely not a wolf. Experts, including two prominent wolf specialists, analyzed the video and concluded that the creature seen in the recording was more likely a cat, possibly a long-haired one, based on its size and movements. However, the boys and their parents maintained that it appeared to be a wolf at the time. Furthermore, while there were reports of wolves being sighted nearby, the specific animal in the boys’ video did not match the characteristics of a wolf. In response to expert analysis, the local media outlet (JydskeVestkysten) modified the headline and acknowledged the doubts regarding the identity of the animal, clarifying that the boys were scared but that the actual animal might not have been a wolf. This reflects a mix of perspectives: the boys’ belief it was a wolf and expert analysis suggesting it was likely a different animal. Therefore, while the fear experienced by the boys is valid, the claim that they were actually scared by a wolf is not fully substantiated.;Fact-Check: Boys' Wolf Encounter Debunked - Experts Identify Feline Foe (Verdict: False);1. Claim: The initial report stated that two boys in Esbjerg were scared by a wolf that approached them while they were climbing trees, causing them to remain in the tree for an hour and a half as it circled below.2. Evidence: Two leading Danish wolf experts reviewed the video taken by the boys and concluded that the animal depicted was a long-haired cat, not a wolf, based on its size and movements. The news outlet that initially reported the story, JydskeVestkysten, subsequently issued a clarification and changed its headline to reflect doubts about the animal being a wolf.3. Verdict: The claim that the boys encountered a wolf is false. The expert analysis of the video provides strong evidence that the animal was a cat, leading to the conclusion that the boys likely misidentified the animal.;Here's my professional fact-check verdict:1. What is the claim being assessed?  The claim being assessed is that two boys in Esbjerg, Denmark, had a frightening encounter with a wolf while climbing trees near their school, causing them to remain in the tree for an hour and a half as the wolf circled below.2. What is the final verdict?  False.3. Explain how the evidence supports the verdict in a clear and concise manner.  The verdict of False is supported by the expert analysis of the video recorded by the boys. Two leading Danish wolf experts independently examined the footage and concluded that the animal depicted is a cat, likely long-haired, based on its size and movements. This directly contradicts the boys' initial identification of the animal as a wolf. Furthermore, the news outlet that originally reported the story, JydskeVestkysten, has since published a clarification and changed its headline to reflect the doubts raised by these experts, acknowledging that it was likely not a wolf that scared the boys. This retraction and the expert consensus on the animal's identity definitively disprove the central claim of a wolf encounter.;Video Doesn't Show Wolf: Boys' Tree Scare Was Actually a Cat;Claim: Two boys in Esbjerg, Denmark were scared by a wolf that circled below them while they were climbing a tree.Evidence: A video recording taken by the boys, which was reviewed by two leading wolf experts, Peter Sunde and Kent Olsen. They concluded that the animal in the video is not a wolf, but a cat, likely a long-haired one.Verdict: False. The claim that a wolf was present and scared the two boys is not supported by the evidence.

The media outlet's subsequent clarification and update of their article also supports this verdict.;False: Esbjerg Boys Mistook Cat for Wolf in Tree-Climbing Scare;Claim: The fact-check examines a report by JydskeVestkysten claiming that two boys, aged 11 and 12, in Esbjerg, Denmark, encountered a wolf that circled below them for an hour and a half while they hid in a tree out of fear.Evidence: Key evidence includes:  Two wolf experts, Peter Sunde from Aarhus University and Kent Olsen from the Natural History Museum, reviewed the boys’ video and concluded the animal was a cat, likely long-haired, based on its size and movements.  A screenshot published by JydskeVestkysten, which resembled a wolf, was provided by the boys but not directly verified by the outlet.  JydskeVestkysten updated their article, changing the headline to reflect the boys’ fear rather than a confirmed wolf, noting a janitor saw a “dog-like animal,” and admitting they should have been more cautious in claiming it was a wolf.Verdict: False. The claim is false because expert analysis confirmed the animal was a cat, not a wolf. The unverified screenshot and JydskeVestkysten’s revisions, including their acknowledgment of premature conclusions, support the experts’ findings. The boys likely misidentified a cat due to fear or unfamiliarity, leading to the incorrect initial report of a wolf.;1.

FC_02;Bullet point summary;The Trump circle again makes the false claim that Greenlanders want to be part of the United States;American Trump supporters continue to claim that Greenlanders want to be part of the United States.  But there is nothing to indicate that this is the wish of the Greenlanders.   According to a researcher, the Trump administration is trying to convince a skeptical American public that annexing Greenland is a good idea.  But we do not know the Greenlanders' position on negotiating a cooperation agreement with the United States, and such an option is still on the table.;This is the fact-check :While US Vice President JD Vance was visiting American soldiers at Pituffik Space Base in northwestern Greenland at the end of March, Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna was on live air on Fox News .Here she said that not only is Greenland a strategically good place for the United States, but the Greenlandic population is a big supporter of potentially becoming an American territory.It is far from the first time that President Donald Trump himself or his circle of supporters have said that Greenlanders would like to be part of the United States. Back in January, the president claimed, in connection with his desire to take over Greenland, for example , that “the Greenlandic people will be with us.”So is there really anything to talk about? Do Greenlanders want to belong to the United States, since the Trump circle keeps repeating it?Live on Fox News, Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna reiterates that Greenlanders want to be American territory.Wants American supportNo, there is nothing to suggest that at all, says Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen , an associate professor at the Danish Defence Academy's Centre for Arctic Security Studies, referring to a poll by the research institute Verian .The same poll was also used back in January to refute Donald Trump's claim that Greenlanders want to be part of the United States. Verian's poll found that only six percent of Greenlanders want to leave the Commonwealth and instead become part of the United States. A full 85 percent answered no to the same question. Yet Trump supporters seem to be sticking to the claim. The reason for this must be found within American borders, believes Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen.In the US, the idea of taking over Greenland is also unpopular. The Trump administration is trying to influence public opinion so that it will appear as a good idea. It requires a narrative that the US can really get a lot out of it, and that the Greenlanders are on board with it, he says.A new poll from the Pew Research Center shows that there is low support among Americans for Trump's plan to take over Greenland. 54 percent do not believe that the United States should take over Greenland, while 23 percent are in favor.Fraudulent measurementHowever, there is one opinion poll that supports the Trump circle's interpretation of the Greenlanders' position. Back in January, the organization Patriot Polling presented startling figures shortly after Donald Trump Jr.'s visit to Nuuk.

Polls, such as the one conducted by Verian, show overwhelming opposition to such a move, with only 6% of Greenlanders in favor. Claims from Trump supporters, including the Patriot Polling survey, have been discredited due to flawed methodology and lack of reliable data. Therefore, the assertion that Greenlanders want to join the U.S. is false.;Fact-Check: Claim That Greenlanders Want to Be US Territory Is False;Claims by Republican figures like Anna Paulina Luna and Donald Trump suggesting widespread support among Greenlanders for becoming a US territory are not supported by reliable polling data. A Verian poll indicated only 6% of Greenlanders favor this idea, with 85% opposed. One poll from Patriot Polling claimed 57% support, but experts have dismissed its methodology as flawed, suggesting potentially tampered or fabricated data due to its claim of using non-existent landlines in Greenland. While some, like podcaster Charlie Kirk, interpret the increased support for the Naleraq party in Greenlandic elections as a sign of growing pro-US sentiment, experts like Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen point out that the more Trump-skeptical Demokraatit party actually won the election. Although Greenlandic politicians have rejected the idea of becoming a US territory following Trump's statements, they remain open to exploring other forms of closer partnership with the United States, though recent political developments suggest a more cautious approach.;Based on the evidence presented in the fact-check, the verdict is False.The claim that the Greenlandic population is a big supporter of potentially becoming an American territory is directly contradicted by reliable polling data, which shows overwhelming opposition to the idea. The only poll suggesting otherwise has been discredited by experts due to significant methodological flaws.;Fact-Check: Claim That Greenlanders Support Becoming U.S. Territory is False;Greenlanders' Views on U.S. Territory: Claims by U.S. political figures, including Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna and former President Donald Trump, that Greenlanders want to become part of the U.S. are contradicted by polls. A recent Verian poll indicates that only 6% of Greenlanders support this idea, while 85% oppose it.  Skepticism Toward Polling Methods: The legitimacy of a poll by Patriot Polling, which claimed 57% support for U.S. annexation, has been questioned by experts due to methodological flaws, including the lack of landlines in Greenland for polling.  Political Landscape and U.S. Relations: Following recent parliamentary elections, Greenlandic parties have distanced themselves from U.S. annexation ideas, with some expressing a desire for independence from Denmark instead. Current political sentiments suggest a more cautious approach to potential U.S. partnerships.;The claim that the Greenlandic population is a big supporter of potentially becoming an American territory is false.Polling data indicates that only a small percentage of Greenlanders (6%) support leaving the Commonwealth to become part of the United States, while 85% oppose this idea. Furthermore, claims from Trump supporters suggesting significant support for U.S. annexation are based on discredited polling methods and have been denied by experts. While there are some political movements in Greenland that are pro-U.S., the overall sentiment among Greenlanders does not support the idea of becoming part of the United States.In conclusion, the claim lacks factual support and misrepresents the views of the Greenlandic population.;Fact-Check: Claims of Greenlanders Wanting U.S. Territory Status Are False;Claims by Trump supporters, including Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna and Charlie Kirk, that Greenlanders want to join the United States are unsupported by reliable polls, with a Verian survey showing only 6% of Greenlanders favor becoming a U.S. territory, while 85% oppose it.A questionable Patriot Polling survey, cited by Trump allies, claimed 57% of Greenlanders support U.S. annexation, but experts like Ulrik Pram Gad dismiss it as likely fabricated or methodologically flawed, noting Greenland lacks landlines, which the poll supposedly used.Greenland's recent parliamentary elections saw gains for the Trump-skeptical Demokraatit party, and the new coalition government has adopted a more reserved stance toward U.S. cooperation, despite interest in potential agreements, amid Trump's repeated annexation rhetoric.;The verdict for the fact-check is False.The claim that Greenlanders want to become part of the United States, as repeatedly stated by Trump supporters like Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna and Charlie Kirk, is not supported by credible evidence.

But there is nothing to indicate that this is the wish of the Greenlanders.   According to a researcher, the Trump administration is trying to convince a skeptical American public that annexing Greenland is a good idea.  But we do not know the Greenlanders' position on negotiating a cooperation agreement with the United States, and such an option is still on the table.;This is the fact-check :While US Vice President JD Vance was visiting American soldiers at Pituffik Space Base in northwestern Greenland at the end of March, Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna was on live air on Fox News .Here she said that not only is Greenland a strategically good place for the United States, but the Greenlandic population is a big supporter of potentially becoming an American territory.It is far from the first time that President Donald Trump himself or his circle of supporters have said that Greenlanders would like to be part of the United States. Back in January, the president claimed, in connection with his desire to take over Greenland, for example , that “the Greenlandic people will be with us.”So is there really anything to talk about?

Verian's poll found that only six percent of Greenlanders want to leave the Commonwealth and instead become part of the United States. A full 85 percent answered no to the same question. Yet Trump supporters seem to be sticking to the claim. The reason for this must be found within American borders, believes Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen.In the US, the idea of taking over Greenland is also unpopular.

Patriot Polling's survey (promoted by Trump supporters) claims that 57% of Greenlanders favor joining the US, but this poll is heavily criticized for methodological flaws, such as calling landlines when Greenland has virtually no landlines.  Expert Opinions:    Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen and Ulrik Pram Gad, experts on Arctic issues, argue that there is no real evidence supporting the claim that Greenlanders want to become part of the US.  Election Results and Political Positions:    Greenland’s parliamentary elections show that pro-independence and skeptical parties, such as Demokraatit, are making significant gains, indicating a lack of support for American annexation. Greenlandic party leaders also distanced themselves from Trump's claims.    While there is interest in closer cooperation with the US, Greenlandic politicians have shown more caution toward direct political integration, especially following Trump’s statements.Verdict and Key Reasons: Verdict: FalseThe claim that Greenlanders want to become part of the United States is not supported by credible evidence.

While there is interest in a closer partnership with the US, Greenlanders have consistently rejected the notion of full political integration with the US.;Claim Being Verified: The claim being verified is that Greenlanders support the idea of becoming part of the United States, as stated by figures like Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna and President Donald Trump’s supporters.Final Verdict: FalseEvidence or Reasoning Supporting This Verdict:  Poll Results: A poll by Verian found that only 6% of Greenlanders want to leave the Commonwealth and join the United States, while 85% oppose it.  Expert Analysis: Experts like Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen and Ulrik Pram Gad argue that there is no evidence to support the claim that Greenlanders want to join the US, citing the flawed methodology of a competing poll (Patriot Polling) that suggested otherwise.  Election Results: The results of recent Greenlandic parliamentary elections show significant support for pro-independence parties and skepticism toward US integration, further indicating that Greenlanders do not desire to become part of the US.  Political Distancing: Greenlandic political leaders have distanced themselves from Trump's statements about annexing Greenland, and the general sentiment is more focused on seeking closer cooperation rather than full political integration with the US.;Fact-Check: No Evidence Greenlanders Want to Become Part of the U.S.;1.

The claim being verified is whether the Greenlandic population supports the idea of becoming an American territory, as suggested by Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna and previously by President Donald Trump and his supporters.2. What is the main evidence used to support or refute this claim?  The main evidence used to refute the claim is a poll conducted by the research institute Verian, which found that only 6% of Greenlanders want to leave the Commonwealth and become part of the United States, while 85% answered no. Additionally, the fact-check highlights the questionable methodology of a poll by Patriot Polling, which claimed a majority of Greenlanders supported joining the US, noting that it reportedly used landline polling in a country with no landlines. The statements of experts like Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen and Ulrik Pram Gad, who interpret election results and polling data as indicating a lack of support for becoming part of the US, also serve as key evidence.3. What is the verdict given in the fact-check, and what are the key reasons behind this verdict?  The verdict is essentially false. The key reasons behind this verdict are:   A credible poll by Verian shows overwhelming opposition (85%) among Greenlanders to becoming part of the United States.   Experts have discredited the only poll suggesting support for the idea, citing potentially tampered or fabricated data and flawed methodology.   Greenlandic party leaders have publicly distanced themselves from Donald Trump's statements about annexing Greenland.   While a closer partnership with the US is not entirely off the table for some Greenlandic politicians, this is distinct from wanting to become an American territory, and no polls exist on specific partnership models.

Claim Being Evaluated:The claim being evaluated in this fact-check is that Greenlanders want to become part of the United States. This assertion has been repeated by various individuals, including Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, who stated on Fox News that Greenlanders are supportive of potentially becoming an American territory. The claim has also been endorsed by figures such as former President Donald Trump and his supporters, with some suggesting that Greenlanders are interested in joining the U.S.2. Examination of Evidence:The evidence provided in the fact-check presents several pieces of information that both support and contradict this claim:Supporting Evidence:  Patriot Polling (January 2025): A poll conducted by Patriot Polling claimed that 57% of Greenlanders supported the idea of Greenland becoming part of the United States. This result was circulated by Trump-supporting figures, such as podcaster Charlie Kirk, who argued that it showed Greenlanders' support for joining the U.S.  Political Interpretations: Proponents of the claim, like Charlie Kirk, interpret the recent political climate in Greenland, especially the rise of the Naleraq party, as evidence that Greenlanders are more receptive to the idea of joining the U.S.Contradictory Evidence:  Verian Poll (2024): The Verian poll, cited by experts like Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen and Ulrik Pram Gad, found that only 6% of Greenlanders supported leaving the Commonwealth to become part of the United States, while 85% rejected this idea. This poll was widely used to counter the claims made by Trump and his supporters.  Methodological Issues with Patriot Polling: Experts, including Ulrik Pram Gad, questioned the validity of the Patriot Polling results. They pointed out that the methodology used by Patriot Polling was flawed, as they relied on landline calls, which are nonexistent in Greenland. This raises doubts about whether the poll truly captured Greenlanders' opinions.  Election Results: Following the 2025 Greenlandic parliamentary elections, the pro-independence and Commonwealth-friendly parties, like Demokraatit, made significant gains, while the pro-U.S. Naleraq party did not see the expected surge. This is interpreted by Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen as a sign that Greenlanders are not particularly inclined to pursue closer ties with the United States, undermining the idea that Greenlanders want to become part of the U.S.Contextual Factors:  Political Climate: Some Greenlandic politicians, particularly in the Demokraatit party, have distanced themselves from the idea of Greenland becoming an American territory due to Trump’s previous statements. This shift in political sentiment suggests that Greenlanders might be increasingly wary of American involvement, particularly in light of Trump’s overtures.3. Conclusion:The final verdict of the fact-check is that there is no evidence to suggest that Greenlanders want to become part of the United States. The Verian poll, which shows overwhelming opposition to this idea, provides a strong counterpoint to the claims made by Trump’s supporters. Additionally, the methodological flaws in the Patriot Polling survey further undermine its credibility. While there are some political figures in Greenland who are open to closer cooperation with the U.S., the population at large does not appear to support the notion of Greenland becoming an American territory. The evidence from the Greenlandic elections and political discourse indicates that Greenlanders are more interested in maintaining their autonomy and strengthening ties with Denmark rather than pursuing U.S. territorial status.Key Explanations Leading to the Verdict:  The Verian poll, with its clear results showing overwhelming opposition, is a critical piece of evidence that contradicts the claim.  The questionable methodology of the Patriot Polling survey casts doubt on the legitimacy of its findings.  Political trends in Greenland, as reflected in election results and public statements by party leaders, suggest that Greenlanders are not inclined to seek U.S. annexation. Instead, they are more focused on maintaining or increasing their independence and autonomy.;1. Identify the Claim Being Evaluated:The claim being evaluated is that Greenlanders want to become part of the United States. This claim has been reiterated by various individuals, including Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna and figures in Donald Trump's circle, suggesting that Greenlanders are in favor of the idea of Greenland becoming a U.S. territory.2. Review the Key Evidence Provided to Assess the Claim:Evidence Supporting the Claim:  Patriot Polling (January 2025): This poll, cited by Trump supporters like podcaster Charlie Kirk, reported that 57% of Greenlanders supported the idea of Greenland joining the United States. This result is used by those advocating for closer U.S.-Greenland ties to support their claim.  Political Movements in Greenland: Proponents of the claim point to the rise of the Naleraq party, which is seen as more pro-American. They interpret this as a sign that Greenlanders might be growing more open to the idea of U.S. involvement or even becoming part of the U.S.Evidence Contradicting the Claim:  Verian Poll (2024): This poll found that only 6% of Greenlanders wanted to leave the Commonwealth of Denmark and join the United States, with 85% of respondents rejecting the idea. This robust finding directly contradicts the claim of widespread support for U.S. annexation.  Methodological Issues with Patriot Polling: Experts, including Ulrik Pram Gad, questioned the reliability of the Patriot Polling survey. They noted that it used landline phone calls, which are virtually nonexistent in Greenland, suggesting the poll could not have accurately represented the views of the Greenlandic population.  Election Results and Political Shifts: After the 2025 Greenlandic elections, pro-independence and Commonwealth-friendly parties, like Demokraatit, made significant gains, while the pro-U.S. Naleraq party did not see the expected surge. This suggests that Greenlanders are not overwhelmingly inclined to pursue closer ties with the U.S., weakening the argument that there is broad support for U.S. annexation.  Statements from Greenlandic Politicians: Following Trump’s statements, many Greenlandic political leaders distanced themselves from the idea of Greenland becoming a U.S. territory, indicating a lack of support for such a proposal.3. Verdict: FalseBased on the evidence reviewed, the claim that Greenlanders want to become part of the United States is false.Justification:  The Verian poll shows overwhelming opposition to the idea, with only 6% of Greenlanders expressing support for becoming part of the U.S. and 85% rejecting the idea. This is a clear and significant majority against the claim.  The Patriot Polling survey, which reported a 57% support for joining the U.S., has serious methodological flaws, such as using landlines, which are not present in Greenland, casting doubt on its reliability.  The Greenlandic election results further contradict the claim, as the pro-independence and Commonwealth-friendly parties gained ground, while pro-U.S. sentiments did not see significant growth.  Statements from Greenlandic politicians also reflect a reluctance to consider U.S. annexation, distancing themselves from the notion, and expressing more interest in maintaining or enhancing their relationship with Denmark.In conclusion, the claim is not supported by credible evidence and is, therefore, false.;Fact-Check: Claim That Greenlanders Want to Be US Territory Is False;The Claim: The core claim being evaluated is that the Greenlandic population is a big supporter of potentially becoming an American territory, as stated by Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna on Fox News. This claim is also supported by statements from Donald Trump and his circle.2. The Evidence: Verian Poll:   This poll found that only 6% of Greenlanders support becoming part of the United States, while 85% reject the idea. This poll is used to refute the claim. Patriot Polling:   This poll claimed that 57% of Greenlanders support joining the United States. However, experts have discredited this poll, citing methodological flaws, such as claiming to use landline phone calls in a place where landlines are not common, and the possibility of data tampering or fabrication. Pew Research Center Poll:   This poll showed that within the United States, 54% of Americans do not believe the US should take over Greenland, while only 23% are in favor. Greenlandic Election Results:   The recent Greenlandic parliamentary elections saw the Demokraatit party, which is considered Trump-skeptical, winning. This result contradicts the idea of growing pro-US sentiment in Greenland.   Also, all Greenlandic party leaders have distanced themselves from Trumps statements regarding annexation. Expert Opinions:   Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen from the Danish Defence Academy and Ulrik Pram Gad from the Danish Institute for International Studies (DIIS) both provide expert analysis that contradicts the claim.   Tom Dans, former US Arctic Commissioner, stated that because no concrete offers have been given to Greenland, that the question of Greenland becoming a US territory is a false choice. Greenlands current political climate:   The current coalition agreement between Greenlandic political parties has taken a more reserved tone towards the United states.3. The Verdict: The fact-check concludes that there is no evidence to support the claim that Greenlanders want to become part of the United States. The Verian poll, expert opinions, and the Greenlandic election results all strongly indicate that the majority of Greenlanders do not support this idea. The Patriot Polling data is considered unreliable. The political climate in Greenland has shown a push back against trumps statements, and a more reserved approach to a potential agreement with the US. Therefore, the claims made by Anna Paulina Luna and Donald Trump are deemed to be false.;Absolutely. Let's break down the verdict determination:1. Identify the Claim:   The claim is that the Greenlandic population is a big supporter of potentially becoming an American territory.2. Review the Key Evidence:   Verian Poll: Overwhelmingly shows that the vast majority (85%) of Greenlanders reject the idea, with only 6% in favor.   Patriot Polling: Claimed a majority in favor, but is widely discredited by experts due to methodological flaws and potential fabrication.   Greenlandic Election Results: The success of the Trump-skeptical Demokraatit party contradicts the claim of growing pro-US sentiment.   Expert Opinions: Experts consistently refute the claim, highlighting the unreliability of the supporting poll and the clear results of the opposing poll.   Political Statements: Greenlandic political leaders have publicly distanced themselves from the idea of becoming a US territory.   Political climate: Greenland's current political climate has become more reserved in terms of any agreement with the US.3. Determine the Verdict:   Based on the overwhelming evidence, the claim is false.   Justification:     The Verian poll, considered the most reliable source, directly contradicts the claim.     The poll that supports the claim is heavily discredited.     The results of the Greenlandic elections do not support the claim.     The experts and political leaders all contradict the claim.     The political climate is moving away from the idea.   Therefore, the assertion that Greenlanders largely support becoming a US territory is not supported by credible evidence.;Claim that Greenlanders want to be part of the US is FALSE;1. Claim being evaluated: The claim is that the Greenlandic population wants to become an American territory or part of the United States. This claim has been repeated by President Donald Trump, his supporters, and some US media personalities, including Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna and podcaster Charlie Kirk.2. Main evidence provided: The fact-check presents several pieces of evidence to assess the truthfulness of this claim:  A poll by the research institute Verian found that only 6% of Greenlanders want to leave the Commonwealth and become part of the United States, while 85% answered no to this question.  An associate professor at the Danish Defence Academy's Centre for Arctic Security Studies, Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen, states that there is no evidence to suggest that Greenlanders want to be part of the United States.  A senior researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies (DIIS), Ulrik Pram Gad, questions the methodology of a poll by Patriot Polling that claimed 57% of Greenlanders supported joining the United States, suggesting that the numbers may be tampered with or invented.  The fact-check also notes that Greenlandic politicians have distanced themselves from Donald Trump's statements about annexing Greenland.  A new poll from the Pew Research Center shows that there is low support among Americans for Trump's plan to take over Greenland.3. Verdict and justification: The verdict of the fact-check is that there is no evidence to suggest that the Greenlandic population wants to become an American territory or part of the United States. The Verian poll and expert opinions from Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen and Ulrik Pram Gad all indicate that the claim is unfounded. The fact-check concludes that the Trump circle's interpretation of the Greenlanders' position is likely a narrative to influence public opinion in the United States, rather than a reflection of actual Greenlandic sentiment. The fact-check also notes that while Greenlanders may be interested in exploring a closer partnership with the US, their recent statements and actions suggest a more reserved approach due to Trump's previous statements about annexing Greenland.;Fact-Check Verdict:Claim: The Greenlandic population wants to become an American territory or part of the United States.Verdict: FALSEJustification:  Claim Identification: The claim being evaluated is whether the Greenlandic population wants to become an American territory or part of the United States. This claim has been repeated by President Donald Trump, his supporters, and some US media personalities.  Key Evidence Review:    A Verian poll found that only 6% of Greenlanders want to leave the Commonwealth and become part of the United States, while 85% answered no.    Experts, including Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen and Ulrik Pram Gad, question the validity of claims that a significant portion of Greenlanders want to join the US, citing methodological flaws in opposing polls.    Greenlandic politicians have distanced themselves from Donald Trump's statements about annexing Greenland.    A Pew Research Center poll shows low support among Americans for Trump's plan to take over Greenland.  Verdict Determination: Based on the evidence, the claim that the Greenlandic population wants to become an American territory or part of the United States is false. The substantial majority of Greenlanders, as indicated by reliable polling and expert analysis, do not support this idea. Misleading or methodologically flawed polls suggesting otherwise do not change the overall conclusion. Therefore, the claim is categorized as false.;Fact-Check: Trump Allies’ Claim That Greenlanders Want U.S. Territory Status Is False;1. Identify and explain the claim being evaluated in this fact-check The claim being evaluated is that Greenlanders want to become part of the United States as an American territory. This assertion has been repeatedly made by Trump supporters, including Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna during a Fox News appearance, President Donald Trump in statements about acquiring Greenland, and podcaster Charlie Kirk, who cited a poll and Greenland’s election results to support the claim. The core statement is that the Greenlandic population strongly supports or is receptive to the idea of joining the United States, a narrative pushed by Trump’s circle to justify U.S. interest in Greenland.2. Examine the main evidence provided to assess the truthfulness of this claim The fact-check presents several pieces of evidence to assess the claim: - Verian Poll: A poll conducted by the research institute Verian found that only 6% of Greenlanders want to leave the Danish Commonwealth and join the United States, while 85% explicitly oppose this idea. This poll is cited as a reliable indicator of Greenlandic sentiment, despite some methodological limitations (non-representative sampling and a dual-question format). Experts like Ulrik Pram Gad note that the overwhelming results still provide a strong indication of opposition. - Patriot Polling Survey: A survey by Patriot Polling, promoted by Trump allies like Charlie Kirk, claimed 57% of Greenlanders support U.S. annexation. However, experts, including Ulrik Pram Gad from the Danish Institute for International Studies, discredit this poll, arguing it is either tampered with or entirely fabricated. The survey’s methodology, which supposedly involved calling landlines, is deemed implausible since Greenland lacks landline infrastructure. - Greenland’s Parliamentary Elections: The fact-check analyzes recent election results in Greenland, noting that the Trump-skeptical Demokraatit party won, signaling a lack of support for U.S.-aligned policies. While the Naleraq party, described by Kirk as “pro-USA” due to its role in arranging Donald Trump Jr.’s visit, made gains, its progress was less significant than Demokraatit’s. Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen from the Danish Defence Academy interprets this as evidence that Greenlanders are not receptive to U.S. annexation. - Political Statements and Context: Greenlandic party leaders across the political spectrum have publicly rejected Trump’s annexation rhetoric post-election. Additionally, the new coalition agreement between Demokraatit, Inuit Ataqatigiit, Siumut, and Atassut is described as more reserved toward U.S. cooperation compared to previous strategies, reflecting caution due to Trump’s aggressive statements. - U.S. Public Opinion: A Pew Research Center poll shows low American support for Greenland annexation (54% oppose, 23% support), suggesting the Trump circle’s narrative may be an attempt to sway U.S. public opinion by falsely claiming Greenlandic support, as per Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen. These sources collectively challenge the claim, with the Verian poll and election outcomes providing the strongest counterevidence, while the Patriot Polling survey is dismissed as unreliable.3. Conclude with the verdict given in the fact-check The verdict of the fact-check is False. The reasons justifying this conclusion are: - Overwhelming Poll Evidence: The Verian poll’s results (6% support, 85% opposition) provide a clear and strong indication that Greenlanders do not want to join the United States, directly contradicting the claim. Despite minor methodological flaws, the poll’s findings are considered robust due to the decisive margin. - Discredited Counterclaim: The Patriot Polling survey, which supports the Trump circle’s narrative, is deemed unreliable by experts due to its implausible methodology (landlines in Greenland) and potential fabrication, undermining its credibility. - Political Rejection in Greenland: The success of the Trump-skeptical Demokraatit party in Greenland’s elections, combined with the new coalition’s reserved stance toward U.S. cooperation and explicit rejections of annexation by Greenlandic leaders, demonstrates a lack of local support for the idea. - Misleading Narrative: The fact-check suggests the Trump circle’s persistence in claiming Greenlandic support is a strategic effort to influence U.S. public opinion, as Greenland annexation is unpopular domestically. This context further weakens the claim’s validity, as it appears driven by political motives rather than evidence. In summary, the claim is false because credible data (Verian poll), political developments (elections and leadership statements), and expert analysis consistently show that Greenlanders overwhelmingly reject the idea of becoming a U.S. territory, and the sole supporting poll is not trustworthy.;1. Identify the claim being evaluated The claim being evaluated is that Greenlanders want to become part of the United States as an American territory. This assertion has been made by Trump supporters, including Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna on Fox News, President Donald Trump in statements about acquiring Greenland, and podcaster Charlie Kirk, who cited a poll and Greenland’s election results to support the claim.2. Review the key evidence provided to assess the claim The fact-check provides several pieces of evidence to assess the claim’s validity: - Verian Poll: A poll by the research institute Verian found that only 6% of Greenlanders support leaving the Danish Commonwealth to join the United States, while 85% oppose it. Despite methodological limitations (non-representative sampling and a dual-question format), experts like Ulrik Pram Gad consider the results a strong indication of Greenlandic opposition due to the overwhelming margin. - Patriot Polling Survey: A survey by Patriot Polling, promoted by Trump allies like Charlie Kirk, claimed 57% of Greenlanders support U.S. annexation. Experts, including Ulrik Pram Gad from the Danish Institute for International Studies, dismiss this poll as likely fabricated or flawed, noting that it supposedly relied on landlines, which do not exist in Greenland. - Greenland’s Parliamentary Elections: Recent elections saw the Trump-skeptical Demokraatit party win, suggesting limited support for U.S.-aligned policies. While the Naleraq party, described as “pro-USA” by Kirk for facilitating Donald Trump Jr.’s visit, made gains, its progress was less significant than Demokraatit’s. Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen from the Danish Defence Academy interprets this as evidence that Greenlanders are not receptive to U.S. annexation. - Political Statements: Post-election, all Greenlandic party leaders rejected Trump’s annexation rhetoric. The new coalition government (Demokraatit, Inuit Ataqatigiit, Siumut, and Atassut) has adopted a more reserved stance toward U.S. cooperation compared to prior strategies, reflecting caution due to Trump’s statements. - U.S. Context: A Pew Research Center poll shows 54% of Americans oppose Greenland annexation, with only 23% in favor. Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen suggests the Trump circle’s claims are an attempt to sway U.S. public opinion by falsely asserting Greenlandic support.3. Determine the verdict and justify the decision The verdict is False. Justification: - The Verian poll provides credible evidence that only 6% of Greenlanders support joining the U.S., while 85% oppose it, directly contradicting the claim. The poll’s methodological issues are minor compared to the decisive results, as confirmed by experts. - The Patriot Polling survey, the only evidence supporting the claim, is discredited due to its implausible methodology (landlines in Greenland) and potential fabrication, rendering it unreliable. - Greenland’s political landscape, marked by the electoral success of the Trump-skeptical Demokraatit party and unanimous rejection of annexation by party leaders, further undermines the claim. The coalition’s cautious approach to U.S. cooperation reflects a lack of enthusiasm for the idea. - The Trump circle’s persistence in claiming Greenlandic support appears motivated by a desire to influence U.S. public opinion, as annexation is unpopular domestically. This context suggests the claim is a strategic narrative rather than a fact-based assertion. Based on the robust Verian poll, discredited counterevidence, and Greenland’s political rejection of U.S. annexation, the claim that Greenlanders want to join the United States is false.
FC_02;Bullet point summary;The Trump circle again makes the false claim that Greenlanders want to be part of the United States;American Trump supporters continue to claim that Greenlanders want to be part of the United States.  But there is nothing to indicate that this is the wish of the Greenlanders.   According to a researcher, the Trump administration is trying to convince a skeptical American public that annexing Greenland is a good idea.  But we do not know the Greenlanders' position on negotiating a cooperation agreement with the United States, and such an option is still on the table.;This is the fact-check :While US Vice President JD Vance was visiting American soldiers at Pituffik Space Base in northwestern Greenland at the end of March, Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna was on live air on Fox News .Here she said that not only is Greenland a strategically good place for the United States, but the Greenlandic population is a big supporter of potentially becoming an American territory.It is far from the first time that President Donald Trump himself or his circle of supporters have said that Greenlanders would like to be part of the United States. Back in January, the president claimed, in connection with his desire to take over Greenland, for example , that “the Greenlandic people will be with us.”So is there really anything to talk about? Do Greenlanders want to belong to the United States, since the Trump circle keeps repeating it?Live on Fox News, Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna reiterates that Greenlanders want to be American territory.Wants American supportNo, there is nothing to suggest that at all, says Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen , an associate professor at the Danish Defence Academy's Centre for Arctic Security Studies, referring to a poll by the research institute Verian .The same poll was also used back in January to refute Donald Trump's claim that Greenlanders want to be part of the United States. Verian's poll found that only six percent of Greenlanders want to leave the Commonwealth and instead become part of the United States. A full 85 percent answered no to the same question. Yet Trump supporters seem to be sticking to the claim. The reason for this must be found within American borders, believes Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen.In the US, the idea of taking over Greenland is also unpopular. The Trump administration is trying to influence public opinion so that it will appear as a good idea. It requires a narrative that the US can really get a lot out of it, and that the Greenlanders are on board with it, he says.A new poll from the Pew Research Center shows that there is low support among Americans for Trump's plan to take over Greenland. 54 percent do not believe that the United States should take over Greenland, while 23 percent are in favor.Fraudulent measurementHowever, there is one opinion poll that supports the Trump circle's interpretation of the Greenlanders' position. Back in January, the organization Patriot Polling presented startling figures shortly after Donald Trump Jr.'s visit to Nuuk. A full 57 percent of Greenlanders reportedly supported the idea of Greenland joining the United States.The Trump-loyal podcaster Charlie Kirk, who was with Donald Trump Jr. in Nuuk, circulated the poll and said that Greenlanders want to be part of the United States . However, experts have since denied that the numbers say anything precise about Greenlanders' attitudes.Either the numbers have been tampered with, or they are freely invented , says Ulrik Pram Gad, a senior researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies (DIIS).“I'm not sure they've even spoken to anyone in Greenland. According to the methodology description, Patriot Polling calls landlines. But there are no landlines in Greenland at all,” he says.  The Verian poll is not perfect either, says Ulrik Pram Gad, because it is difficult to conduct polls in Greenland. Verian's Greenlandic respondents were not selected representatively, just as in the aforementioned question they are asked two things at once. That is, both whether they want to leave the Commonwealth and whether they want to join the USA.“It is methodologically fragile, but the answers are so overwhelming that you can take it as a strong indication that Greenlanders do not want to be part of the USA,” says Ulrik Pram Gad.The people of Greenland want to join America! https:;Contextual;Claim That Greenlanders Want to Join the U.S. is False, Polls and Experts Confirm;The Claim:  The claim being assessed is that Greenlanders want to become part of the United States. Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, as well as others in Trump’s circle, have repeatedly stated that Greenland’s population supports the idea of becoming an American territory. This claim gained traction after statements made by former President Donald Trump, and it was reinforced by a poll circulated by Trump supporters, suggesting that Greenlanders want to join the U.S.2. The Evidence:  - Verian Poll (January 2025): A credible poll showed that only 6% of Greenlanders supported leaving the Commonwealth and becoming part of the U.S., while 85% rejected the idea. This poll strongly suggests that Greenlanders do not want to become part of the U.S.  - Patriot Polling (January 2025): This poll, cited by Trump supporters, claimed that 57% of Greenlanders supported joining the U.S., but experts have dismissed this as unreliable. The methodology was flawed, as it involved calling landlines, which are virtually nonexistent in Greenland.  - Election Results: The results of Greenland’s parliamentary elections show that the pro-independence party Demokraatit, which is skeptical of U.S. control, performed well, while the pro-U.S. Naleraq party did not gain significant ground. This suggests a general reluctance among Greenlanders toward U.S. control.  - Expert Opinions: Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen and Ulrik Pram Gad, experts on Greenland’s politics, emphasized that the majority of Greenlanders do not favor U.S. annexation. Tom Dans, a former U.S. Arctic Commissioner, also indicated that most Greenlanders desire independence from Denmark rather than integration into the U.S.3. The Verdict:  The claim that Greenlanders want to become part of the United States is false. The evidence, including credible polls and expert opinions, overwhelmingly shows that the majority of Greenlanders do not support joining the U.S. While some political factions in Greenland may be open to closer cooperation with the U.S., the notion of annexation or becoming a U.S. territory is not supported by the population. The claims from Trump’s circle, particularly based on flawed polling, are not substantiated by reliable evidence.;Final Verdict  The Claim Being Assessed: The claim being assessed is that Greenlanders support the idea of becoming part of the United States. This assertion has been made by figures like Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna and others in Donald Trump’s circle, suggesting that Greenland’s population is in favor of the U.S. taking control of Greenland.  The Verdict: False  Reasoning and Evidence: The claim is false based on several key pieces of evidence:    Verian Poll (January 2025): This credible poll showed that only 6% of Greenlanders want to leave the Commonwealth and become part of the U.S., while 85% reject the idea. This provides strong evidence that Greenlanders do not support becoming U.S. territory.    Patriot Polling (January 2025): This poll, which suggested 57% support for joining the U.S., has been dismissed as unreliable. Experts criticized the methodology, noting that it relied on calling landlines in Greenland, where landline usage is nearly nonexistent.    Election Results: The political landscape in Greenland, with parties like Demokraatit (which is skeptical of U.S. control) performing well in elections, further suggests that Greenlanders are not interested in U.S. annexation.    Expert Testimonies: Experts such as Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen and Ulrik Pram Gad point out that the majority of Greenlanders do not want to become part of the U.S. Tom Dans, former U.S. Arctic Commissioner, emphasized that Greenlanders overwhelmingly desire independence from Denmark rather than integration with the U.S.Given this evidence, the repeated claims by Trump supporters are unsubstantiated and fail to reflect the views of the Greenlandic population.;Fact-Check: Claim That Greenlanders Want to Be US Territory - FALSE;1. The Claim: Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna and other Trump supporters have asserted that the Greenlandic population largely supports becoming an American territory.2. The Evidence:   A poll by Verian found that only 6% of Greenlanders support joining the United States, while 85% oppose it.   Experts discredit a poll by Patriot Polling, which claimed 57% support, citing methodological flaws and potential manipulation.   Analysis of recent Greenlandic elections indicates that parties skeptical of close ties with the U.S. performed well.   Greenlandic party leaders have publicly distanced themselves from Trump's annexation statements.   Experts like Ulrik Pram Gad highlight that the Verian poll, while not perfect, provides a strong indication of Greenlandic sentiment.   Tom Dans, former US Arctic Commissioner, states that no concrete benefits of US annexation have been explained to Greenlanders, making the current debate a false choice.   The coalition agreement of the newly elected Greenlandic government shows a more reserved stance towards the United States than previous foreign policy strategies.3. The Verdict: The claim is false. The overwhelming evidence, including multiple polls and expert analysis, indicates that the vast majority of Greenlanders do not want to become part of the United States. While there is interest in cooperation with the US, particularly in a form of free association, the idea of becoming a US territory is widely rejected.;Absolutely. Here's the final verdict based on the fact-check:1. What is the claim being assessed?   The claim being assessed is whether the Greenlandic population supports becoming an American territory, as asserted by Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna and other Trump supporters.2. What is the verdict?   The verdict is false.3. What reasoning or evidence supports this decision?   The primary evidence refuting the claim is a poll conducted by Verian, which found that only a small minority (6%) of Greenlanders support becoming part of the United States, while a large majority (85%) oppose it.   Experts have discredited a contrasting poll from Patriot Polling, citing methodological flaws and potential manipulation.   Analysis of recent Greenlandic election results indicates that parties favoring closer ties with Denmark, and skeptical of close ties with the US, performed well.   Greenlandic political leaders have publicly rejected the idea of being annexed by the United States.   Experts, like Ulrik Pram Gad, consider the Verian poll to be a strong indicator of the population's opinion, despite its methodological limitations.   Tom Dans, former US Arctic Commissioner, indicates that there has not been a proper proposition of the benefits of becoming a US territory to the Greenlandic people.   The newly formed coalition agreement of the Greenlandic government has shown a more reserved stance towards the US, than previous foreign policy agreements.   Therefore, the consensus of reliable polling and expert analysis is that the claim is not supported by evidence.;Claim that Greenlanders Want to be Part of the US: FALSE - Evidence Shows Majority Oppose Annexation;The Claim: The claim being assessed is that the Greenlandic population wants to become an American territory or part of the United States. This claim has been repeated by US President Donald Trump, his supporters, and some media outlets.The Evidence: The main evidence provided to evaluate the claim includes: A poll by the research institute Verian, which found that only 6% of Greenlanders want to leave the Commonwealth and become part of the United States, while 85% answered no. A poll by Patriot Polling, which claimed that 57% of Greenlanders supported the idea of Greenland joining the United States, but experts have questioned the methodology and legitimacy of this poll. Statements from Greenlandic politicians, including the new Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen, who have distanced themselves from Donald Trump's statements about annexing and having control over Greenland. The outcome of the Greenlandic parliamentary elections, which saw the Demokraatit party, opposed to Trump's ideas, win.The Verdict: The verdict is that the claim is false. There is no evidence to suggest that the majority of Greenlanders want to become an American territory or part of the United States. In fact, the Verian poll and statements from Greenlandic politicians indicate that the opposite is true. The claim appears to be a misrepresentation or manipulation of public opinion, possibly to influence American public opinion and support for US plans to increase its presence in Greenland.;1. The Claim: The claim being assessed is that the Greenlandic population wants to become an American territory or part of the United States. This claim has been repeated by US President Donald Trump, his supporters, and some media outlets, including Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna and podcaster Charlie Kirk.2. The Verdict: The verdict is FALSE.3. The Reasoning or Evidence: The claim is false because: A Verian poll found that only 6% of Greenlanders want to leave the Commonwealth and become part of the United States, while 85% answered no. Experts have questioned the legitimacy of a Patriot Polling survey that claimed 57% of Greenlanders supported the idea of Greenland joining the United States, citing methodological flaws and potential tampering with the data. Greenlandic politicians, including party leaders, have strongly distanced themselves from Donald Trump's statements about annexing and having control over Greenland. The outcome of the Greenlandic parliamentary elections suggests that the population is skeptical of Trump's plans, with the Demokraatit party, opposed to Trump's ideas, winning.Overall, the evidence suggests that there is no basis for the claim that the majority of Greenlanders want to become an American territory or part of the United States.;Fact-Check: Claim That Greenlanders Want to Be U.S. Territory Is False;1. The Claim: The fact-check assesses the claim that Greenlanders want to become part of the United States as an American territory. This assertion has been repeatedly made by Trump supporters, including Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna on Fox News, President Donald Trump in statements about acquiring Greenland, and podcaster Charlie Kirk, who cited a poll and election results to support the claim.2. The Evidence: The primary evidence refuting the claim is a Verian poll showing only 6% of Greenlanders support joining the U.S., while 85% oppose it. Despite minor methodological flaws, experts like Ulrik Pram Gad consider the results robust. A Patriot Polling survey, cited by Trump allies claiming 57% support, is dismissed as likely fabricated or flawed, as it relied on nonexistent landlines in Greenland. Greenland’s recent parliamentary elections, where the Trump-skeptical Demokraatit party won and the new coalition adopted a reserved stance toward U.S. cooperation, further contradict the claim. All Greenlandic party leaders rejected Trump’s annexation rhetoric. A Pew Research Center poll indicates 54% of Americans oppose Greenland annexation, suggesting the claim is a strategic narrative to sway U.S. opinion, per Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen.3. The Verdict: The verdict is False. The claim is unsupported because the credible Verian poll shows overwhelming Greenlandic opposition, the Patriot Polling survey is unreliable, and Greenland’s political developments, including election results and leadership statements, demonstrate no desire for U.S. annexation. The Trump circle’s persistence likely reflects an attempt to influence U.S. public opinion rather than evidence of Greenlandic support.;1. What is the claim being assessed? The claim being assessed is that Greenlanders want to become part of the United States as an American territory.

Key evidence from multiple polls, including one by Verian, reveals that only a small percentage (6%) of Greenlanders support becoming part of the U.S., with a large majority (85%) opposed. Furthermore, the Patriot Polling survey, which claimed significant support for U.S. annexation, is criticized for flawed methodology. Greenland's recent elections show no surge in pro-U.S. sentiment, with the Demokraatit party, which is more cautious toward U.S. involvement, securing a victory. While Greenlandic leaders may be open to closer cooperation with the U.S., they firmly reject the idea of becoming an American territory. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence and is deemed false.;1. Claim being evaluated: The claim is that Greenlanders want to become part of the United States, as asserted by Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna and some Trump supporters.2. Verdict: The claim is false.3. Evidence or reasoning:  - A Verian poll found that only 6% of Greenlanders want to leave the Commonwealth and join the U.S., while 85% opposed the idea.  - The Patriot Polling survey, which claimed that 57% of Greenlanders support U.S. annexation, is criticized for having flawed methodology, such as using landline calls, which aren't practical in Greenland.  - Recent Greenlandic election results show no growing support for U.S. annexation, with the Demokraatit party, which is skeptical of the U.S., winning the election.  - Greenlandic leaders have distanced themselves from the idea of becoming part of the U.S. after Trump's remarks, signaling that the claim does not reflect the views of the population. Final verdict:Based on the evidence, the claim that Greenlanders want to become part of the United States is false. The surveys and recent political trends indicate that a large majority of Greenlanders do not support such a move, and the methodology behind claims supporting the idea has been seriously questioned.;Fact-Check: Claim That Greenlanders Want to Be US Territory is False;The claim that the Greenlandic population wants to become an American territory is false. The assertion, frequently repeated by figures in Donald Trump's circle, is contradicted by a credible Verian poll showing overwhelming opposition (85%) to such a move, with only 6% in favor. Experts have dismissed the only poll suggesting majority support as methodologically unsound, even suggesting it might be fabricated. Furthermore, immediately following the recent Greenlandic elections, all party leaders explicitly rejected Trump's suggestions of annexation. While one party considered pro-USA did gain some support, the overall election results, with a more Trump-skeptical party winning, indicate a lack of widespread desire among Greenlanders to become part of the United States. Even Trump's former Arctic Commissioner acknowledges that no concrete proposal or benefits have been presented to Greenlanders, making the claim of their support unfounded.;Here's the verdict for the fact-check:1. What is the claim being evaluated? The claim being evaluated is that the Greenlandic population is largely supportive of becoming an American territory.2. Based on the evidence provided, is the claim true, false, mixed or another verdict category? False.3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict? The evidence overwhelmingly refutes the claim. A Verian poll showed that only 6% of Greenlanders support becoming part of the US, while 85% are against it. Experts have discredited the only poll suggesting majority support due to its flawed methodology. Furthermore, Greenlandic political leaders have publicly rejected the idea of becoming an American territory.Final Verdict: The claim that the Greenlandic population is largely supportive of becoming an American territory is false, based on the provided evidence.;False claim: Most Greenlanders do not want to be part of the United States;The claim that Greenlanders want to be part of the United States is false. According to a poll by Verian, only 6% of Greenlanders want to leave the Commonwealth and become part of the United States, while a significant majority (85%) answered no. Experts, including Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen from the Danish Defence Academy, have found no evidence to suggest that Greenlanders are interested in becoming part of the United States. In contrast, a poll by Patriot Polling that claimed a majority of Greenlanders supported joining the United States was deemed to be unreliable, with some experts suggesting that the numbers may have been tampered with or invented. The Greenlandic population has consistently distanced themselves from statements about annexing and having control over Greenland, and politicians have become more reserved towards some kind of agreement with the United States following Donald Trump's statements about making Greenland an American territory. Overall, the evidence suggests that the claim is unfounded and that Greenlanders do not want to be part of the United States.;"Here are the brief answers to each question:1. Claim being evaluated: The claim being evaluated is that Greenlanders want to be part of the United States or the Greenlandic population is a big supporter of potentially becoming an American territory.2. Verdict: The claim is false.3. Evidence and reasoning: The verdict is based on the following evidence and reasoning:	 A Verian poll found that only 6% of Greenlanders want to leave the Commonwealth and become part of the United States, while 85% answered no.	 Experts, including Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen, have found no evidence to suggest that Greenlanders are interested in becoming part of the United States.	 A Patriot Polling that claimed a majority of Greenlanders supported joining the United States was deemed to be unreliable, with some experts suggesting that the numbers may have been tampered with or invented.	 The Greenlandic population has consistently distanced themselves from statements about annexing and having control over Greenland.Final Verdict: The claim that Greenlanders want to be part of the United States is false. This verdict is based on the overwhelming evidence that shows the majority of Greenlanders do not support becoming part of the United States. The Verian poll, which is considered reliable, found that only 6% of Greenlanders support this idea, while experts have found no credible evidence to suggest that Greenlanders are interested in becoming part of the United States. In contrast, claims that suggest a majority of Greenlanders support joining the United States have been deemed unreliable or fabricated. Therefore, the claim is false.";Fact-Check: Claim That Greenlanders Want U.S. Territory Status Proven False;The fact-check evaluates the claim that Greenlanders want to become a U.S. territory, promoted by Trump supporters including Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, President Donald Trump, and podcaster Charlie Kirk. The evidence strongly refutes this claim: a Verian poll indicates only 6% of Greenlanders support joining the U.S., while 85% oppose it, despite minor methodological flaws. A Patriot Polling survey, cited by Trump allies to claim 57% support, is discredited as likely fabricated due to its reliance on nonexistent landlines in Greenland. Additionally, Greenland’s recent parliamentary elections saw the Trump-skeptical Demokraatit party prevail, and all Greenlandic party leaders rejected U.S. annexation, with the new coalition adopting a reserved stance toward U.S. cooperation. A Pew Research Center poll showing 54% American opposition to annexation suggests the claim is a strategic effort to sway U.S. public opinion. Based on the credible Verian poll, the discredited counterevidence, and Greenland’s political rejection of the idea, the verdict is False, as there is no evidence supporting the assertion that Greenlanders want to join the United States.;I'm sorry, but I'm unable to respond to the request about Greenlanders reject U.S. territory claim. Please feel free to ask about another topic, and I'll do my best to assist you.
FC_02;Bullet point summary;The Trump circle again makes the false claim that Greenlanders want to be part of the United States;American Trump supporters continue to claim that Greenlanders want to be part of the United States.  But there is nothing to indicate that this is the wish of the Greenlanders.   According to a researcher, the Trump administration is trying to convince a skeptical American public that annexing Greenland is a good idea.  But we do not know the Greenlanders' position on negotiating a cooperation agreement with the United States, and such an option is still on the table.;This is the fact-check :While US Vice President JD Vance was visiting American soldiers at Pituffik Space Base in northwestern Greenland at the end of March, Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna was on live air on Fox News .Here she said that not only is Greenland a strategically good place for the United States, but the Greenlandic population is a big supporter of potentially becoming an American territory.It is far from the first time that President Donald Trump himself or his circle of supporters have said that Greenlanders would like to be part of the United States. Back in January, the president claimed, in connection with his desire to take over Greenland, for example , that “the Greenlandic people will be with us.”So is there really anything to talk about? Do Greenlanders want to belong to the United States, since the Trump circle keeps repeating it?Live on Fox News, Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna reiterates that Greenlanders want to be American territory.Wants American supportNo, there is nothing to suggest that at all, says Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen , an associate professor at the Danish Defence Academy's Centre for Arctic Security Studies, referring to a poll by the research institute Verian .The same poll was also used back in January to refute Donald Trump's claim that Greenlanders want to be part of the United States. Verian's poll found that only six percent of Greenlanders want to leave the Commonwealth and instead become part of the United States. A full 85 percent answered no to the same question. Yet Trump supporters seem to be sticking to the claim. The reason for this must be found within American borders, believes Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen.In the US, the idea of taking over Greenland is also unpopular. The Trump administration is trying to influence public opinion so that it will appear as a good idea. It requires a narrative that the US can really get a lot out of it, and that the Greenlanders are on board with it, he says.A new poll from the Pew Research Center shows that there is low support among Americans for Trump's plan to take over Greenland. 54 percent do not believe that the United States should take over Greenland, while 23 percent are in favor.Fraudulent measurementHowever, there is one opinion poll that supports the Trump circle's interpretation of the Greenlanders' position. Back in January, the organization Patriot Polling presented startling figures shortly after Donald Trump Jr.'s visit to Nuuk. A full 57 percent of Greenlanders reportedly supported the idea of Greenland joining the United States.The Trump-loyal podcaster Charlie Kirk, who was with Donald Trump Jr. in Nuuk, circulated the poll and said that Greenlanders want to be part of the United States . However, experts have since denied that the numbers say anything precise about Greenlanders' attitudes.Either the numbers have been tampered with, or they are freely invented , says Ulrik Pram Gad, a senior researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies (DIIS).“I'm not sure they've even spoken to anyone in Greenland. According to the methodology description, Patriot Polling calls landlines. But there are no landlines in Greenland at all,” he says.  The Verian poll is not perfect either, says Ulrik Pram Gad, because it is difficult to conduct polls in Greenland. Verian's Greenlandic respondents were not selected representatively, just as in the aforementioned question they are asked two things at once. That is, both whether they want to leave the Commonwealth and whether they want to join the USA.“It is methodologically fragile, but the answers are so overwhelming that you can take it as a strong indication that Greenlanders do not want to be part of the USA,” says Ulrik Pram Gad.The people of Greenland want to join America! https:;Role;Fact-Check: Claim That Greenlanders Support U.S. Annexation is False, Polls Show Overwhelming Rejection;Claim: Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna and others in the Trump circle assert that Greenlanders support the idea of Greenland becoming a U.S. territory.Evidence: - A poll by Verian found that only 6% of Greenlanders support leaving the Commonwealth to become part of the U.S., with 85% rejecting the idea.- A poll by Patriot Polling, circulated by Trump supporters, claimed 57% of Greenlanders supported joining the U.S., but experts questioned the legitimacy of this poll, citing flawed methodology (e.g., calling landlines in a country where landlines are rare).- Greenland’s recent elections showed limited support for U.S. ties, with the Trump-skeptical Demokraatit party gaining the most seats.- Political leaders in Greenland have distanced themselves from the idea of U.S. annexation, with some expressing interest in other forms of cooperation with the U.S. rather than territorial integration.Verdict: False. The evidence overwhelmingly suggests that Greenlanders do not want to become part of the U.S. as a territory. The widely cited Verian poll and the skepticism surrounding the Patriot Polling numbers support the conclusion that Greenlanders are largely opposed to the idea. Additionally, political trends in Greenland reflect a more reserved stance towards closer U.S. ties, especially after Trump's proposals.;1. Claim Being Assessed: The claim is that Greenlanders support the idea of Greenland becoming a U.S. territory, as asserted by Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna and others in the Trump circle.2. Final Verdict: False.3. Explanation of Evidence: The evidence clearly contradicts the claim. A Verian poll found that only 6% of Greenlanders want to become part of the U.S., while 85% oppose it. Additionally, the credibility of another poll by Patriot Polling, which claimed 57% support, was questioned due to methodological flaws (e.g., calling landlines in Greenland where they are scarce). Furthermore, the results of Greenland's recent parliamentary elections and the stance of its political parties indicate a reluctance toward becoming a U.S. territory. Greenland's political leaders have distanced themselves from the idea of annexation, making it clear that the majority of Greenlanders do not want to join the U.S.;Fact-Check: Claim That Greenlanders Want to Be Part of the U.S. is False;1. Claim: Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, along with figures in Donald Trump's circle, asserted that the Greenlandic population largely supports becoming an American territory.2. Evidence:   A poll by Verian showed that only 6% of Greenlanders support becoming part of the United States, while 85% oppose it.   Another poll from Patriot Polling, which claimed 57% support, was discredited by experts due to methodological flaws, including alleged use of landline phone polling in a region where landlines are not common.   Analysis of recent Greenlandic parliamentary elections showed that parties favoring closer ties with Denmark, and those skeptical of Trump's annexation ideas, performed well.   Greenlandic political leaders have publicly distanced themselves from Trump's statements about acquiring Greenland.   Experts like Ulrik Pram Gad and Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen analyzed the polls and election results, concluding that the majority of Greenlanders do not wish to become part of the USA.   Tom Dans, former US Arctic Commissioner, stated that the idea of Greenland becoming part of the US is a false choice.3. Verdict: False. The overwhelming evidence from credible polls and expert analysis indicates that the vast majority of Greenlanders do not want to become part of the United States. Claims stating otherwise are based on flawed or discredited information.;Absolutely. Here's a clear verdict based on the fact-check:1. Claim Being Assessed: The claim is that the Greenlandic population largely supports the idea of becoming an American territory.2. Final Verdict: False.3. Explanation: The evidence overwhelmingly contradicts the claim. A credible poll (Verian) shows that the vast majority of Greenlanders (85%) oppose becoming part of the United States, with only a small minority (6%) in favor. The only poll supporting the claim (Patriot Polling) has been discredited by experts due to significant methodological flaws, thus rendering it unreliable. Furthermore, recent Greenlandic election results and statements from Greenlandic political leaders strongly indicate a lack of support for becoming a U.S. territory. Therefore, the weight of credible evidence clearly demonstrates that the claim is false.;Claim that Most Greenlanders Want to Join the US is False;Claim: The claim being evaluated is that the majority of Greenlanders want to become part of the United States.Summary of Evidence:  A poll by the research institute Verian found that only 6% of Greenlanders want to leave the Commonwealth and become part of the United States, while 85% answered no to the same question. An associate professor at the Danish Defence Academy's Centre for Arctic Security Studies, Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen, stated that there is no evidence to suggest that Greenlanders want to belong to the United States. A poll by Patriot Polling, which claimed that 57% of Greenlanders supported the idea of Greenland joining the United States, was deemed to be methodologically flawed and likely fabricated. Experts, including Ulrik Pram Gad, a senior researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies, questioned the validity of the Patriot Polling results, citing issues such as the lack of landlines in Greenland and the flawed methodology. The recent Greenlandic parliamentary elections did not indicate a shift in public opinion towards joining the United States, with the winning party, Demokraatit, being described as Trump-skeptical.Verdict: Based on the evidence, the claim that the majority of Greenlanders want to become part of the United States is false. The Verian poll, which is considered to be the most reliable, shows that a small minority of Greenlanders support the idea of joining the United States, while the majority do not. The lack of credible evidence supporting the claim, combined with the flawed methodology of the Patriot Polling results, leads to the conclusion that the claim is unfounded.;1. Claim being assessed: The claim being assessed is that the majority of Greenlanders want to become part of the United States.2. Final Verdict: False3. Explanation:The verdict is False because the evidence overwhelmingly suggests that the majority of Greenlanders do not want to become part of the United States. A reliable poll by Verian found that only 6% of Greenlanders support the idea, while 85% oppose it. In contrast, a poll by Patriot Polling that claimed 57% of Greenlanders supported the idea was deemed methodologically flawed and likely fabricated. Furthermore, Greenlandic politicians have distanced themselves from Donald Trump's statements about annexing Greenland, and recent parliamentary elections did not indicate a shift in public opinion towards joining the United States. The evidence clearly indicates that the claim is unfounded and false.;Fact-Check: Trump Supporters’ Claim That Greenlanders Want U.S. Territory Status Is False;Claim: The fact-check evaluates the assertion that Greenlanders want to become part of the United States as an American territory. This claim has been made by Trump supporters, including Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, President Donald Trump, and podcaster Charlie Kirk.Evidence: The primary evidence refuting the claim is a Verian poll showing only 6% of Greenlanders support joining the U.S., while 85% oppose it. Though the poll has minor methodological flaws, experts like Ulrik Pram Gad consider its results reliable due to the clear majority. A Patriot Polling survey, cited by Trump allies to claim 57% support, is discredited as likely fabricated, as it relied on nonexistent landlines in Greenland. Greenland’s recent parliamentary elections saw the Trump-skeptical Demokraatit party win, and all party leaders rejected U.S. annexation, with the new coalition adopting a cautious stance toward U.S. ties. A Pew Research Center poll showing 54% American opposition to annexation suggests the claim is a strategic narrative to influence U.S. opinion.Verdict: The verdict is False. The Verian poll’s strong evidence of Greenlandic opposition, the discredited Patriot Polling survey, and the political rejection of annexation by Greenland’s leaders and electorate demonstrate that the claim lacks credible support. The evidence clearly shows Greenlanders do not want to join the U.S., and the claim appears driven by political motives rather than facts.;1. What is the claim being assessed? The claim being assessed is that Greenlanders want to become part of the United States as an American territory, as stated by Trump supporters including Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, President Donald Trump, and podcaster Charlie Kirk.2. What is the final verdict (true, false, mixed, another relevant verdict category)? The final verdict is False.3. Explain how the evidence supports the verdict in a clear and concise manner. The verdict is supported by robust evidence refuting the claim. A Verian poll shows only 6% of Greenlanders support joining the U.S., while 85% oppose it, providing a clear indication of public sentiment despite minor methodological issues. A Patriot Polling survey claiming 57% support is dismissed as likely fabricated, as it relied on nonexistent landlines in Greenland. Greenland’s recent elections favored the Trump-skeptical Demokraatit party, and all party leaders rejected U.S. annexation, with the new coalition adopting a reserved stance toward U.S. cooperation. Additionally, a Pew Research Center poll indicates 54% American opposition to annexation, suggesting the claim is a strategic narrative. This evidence—credible polling, discredited counterclaims, and Greenland’s political stance—conclusively shows the claim is false, as there is no support for the assertion that Greenlanders want to join the U.S.

While interest in US cooperation exists, the specific claim of wanting to become US territory is overwhelmingly contradicted by the evidence.
FC_03;Bullet point summary;Has Zelensky bought Hitler's old summer residence?;Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has purchased Adolf Hitler's former summer home, according to several posts on social media.  But the story is fabricated and is in all likelihood an example of Russian disinformation.  According to researchers, false allegations about the Ukrainian president have flared up after Donald Trump called the Ukrainian president a dictator.;This is the fact-checkUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has purchased Adolf Hitler's old summer house, Kehlsteinhaus, also known as the Eagle's Nest, for more than 100 million kroner.This is the claim in several posts on both X and Facebook , which also link the summer house purchase with the aid that Ukraine receives from the United States to wage war on Russia. The posts have been viewed hundreds of thousands of times.The posts include photos of alleged purchase contracts and a video detailing the building's history as Adolf Hitler's summer residence, while explaining that the house has now been sold to an Italian company owned by the Ukrainian president.According to the posts, the story about the summer house purchase comes from German media, but the only German media outlet that TjekDet has been able to find the story from is the unknown Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland .It turns out that the German media is actually a Russian propaganda outlet. And Zelenskyy did not buy Hitler's summer house.Hitler's summer residenceKehlsteinhaus was given to Hitler in 1939 as a 50th birthday present by German Nazi politician Martin Bormann. The building gets its name because it is located on the top of the Kehlstein mountain, a whopping 1,834 meters above sea level.Hitler's visits to the house were few and far between, however , because he disliked the heights and the elevator that had to be used to reach the house at the time. The risk of lightning strikes was also not a weather forecast that the German dictator liked.The video, now being shared on social media, shows that President Zelenskyy has purchased the building from the state-owned Bavarian company Immobilien Freistaat Bayern (IMBY), whose director, Gerhard Reichel , according to the video, comments on the sale as follows:“Such transactions with historic sites are very rare. However, in this case, due to the high state subsidy required to ensure the ongoing operation (of the building, ed.), it was only a matter of time before a sale would take place,” it says.But the statement and the sale of Kehlsteinhaus are, according to IMBY, pure fabrication.“The Kehlsteinhaus remains in the ownership of the Free State of Bavaria. A sale has not taken place and is not planned. The alleged purchase contract shown in the video is false, as is the alleged quote from the IMBY management,” IMBY states on their website .They also state that they will take legal action against those who spread the false information on the internet.Volodymyr Zelenskyj bought the Kehlsteinhaus, which previously belonged to Hitler, writes the media outlet Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland, which is apparently German. But the website hides a secret. Photo: Screenshot.The arrow points towards RussiaAs mentioned, the false story was published by the “German” media outlet Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland, and it is most likely a website created for the purpose of spreading Russian disinformation.CheckDet has not been able to find any traces of the media website from before December 14, 2024. According to various services that monitor changes to websites, the first activity on the website was seen on that very day. It was also on December 14 that the website was first archived through the Wayback Machine service.If you search for the website on Google, there are no results from before December 2024.The website also appears on the list of 100 fake websites that, among others, the German fact-checking media Correctiv has identified as being created with the aim of spreading Russian disinformation ahead of the German elections on February 23, 2025.Correctiv has dubbed the influence operation Storm-1516, and according to the media outlet, the operation has links to the Russian troll factory Internet Research Agency (IRA) and the Russian military intelligence service GRU.The false story also ties in with many other stories about Volodymyr Zelenskyj, which TjekDet has previously fact-checked.

The posts have been viewed hundreds of thousands of times.The posts include photos of alleged purchase contracts and a video detailing the building's history as Adolf Hitler's summer residence, while explaining that the house has now been sold to an Italian company owned by the Ukrainian president.According to the posts, the story about the summer house purchase comes from German media, but the only German media outlet that TjekDet has been able to find the story from is the unknown Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland .It turns out that the German media is actually a Russian propaganda outlet. And Zelenskyy did not buy Hitler's summer house.Hitler's summer residenceKehlsteinhaus was given to Hitler in 1939 as a 50th birthday present by German Nazi politician Martin Bormann. The building gets its name because it is located on the top of the Kehlstein mountain, a whopping 1,834 meters above sea level.Hitler's visits to the house were few and far between, however , because he disliked the heights and the elevator that had to be used to reach the house at the time. The risk of lightning strikes was also not a weather forecast that the German dictator liked.The video, now being shared on social media, shows that President Zelenskyy has purchased the building from the state-owned Bavarian company Immobilien Freistaat Bayern (IMBY), whose director, Gerhard Reichel , according to the video, comments on the sale as follows:“Such transactions with historic sites are very rare. However, in this case, due to the high state subsidy required to ensure the ongoing operation (of the building, ed.), it was only a matter of time before a sale would take place,” it says.But the statement and the sale of Kehlsteinhaus are, according to IMBY, pure fabrication.“The Kehlsteinhaus remains in the ownership of the Free State of Bavaria.

It is a means for the Kremlin to obtain favorable terms in any peace agreement that may come.;Chain-of-Thought;False Claim Spreads That Zelenskyy Bought Hitler’s Former Summer Home — No Sale Took Place, Says Bavarian Authorities;1. The Claim Being Evaluated: The core claim being evaluated is that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has purchased Adolf Hitler’s former summer house, the Kehlsteinhaus (Eagle’s Nest), for more than 100 million kroner. The claim further suggests that the purchase is linked to financial aid Ukraine receives from the United States, implying misuse of funds and unethical behavior by Zelenskyy.2. Evidence Used to Assess the Claim: - Official Denial: The Bavarian state-owned company Immobilien Freistaat Bayern (IMBY), which owns the Kehlsteinhaus, explicitly stated that no sale has taken place, nor is one planned. - Fabricated Documents and Quotes: The supposed purchase contracts and quotes from IMBY officials featured in the video spreading the claim were proven to be false and fabricated. - Disinformation Source Identified: The original story was traced to Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland, a website falsely posing as a German media outlet. Investigations revealed it was created in December 2024 and is linked to a Russian disinformation operation called Storm-1516. This operation is associated with the Internet Research Agency (IRA) and GRU, Russia’s military intelligence service. - Broader Pattern: The claim fits into a wider pattern of anti-Zelenskyy and anti-Ukrainian disinformation, including similar false stories previously debunked, such as Zelenskyy’s wife allegedly buying a Bugatti or him acquiring a hotel in Cyprus.3. Final Verdict and Reasoning: Verdict: False The claim is completely untrue. It is based on fabricated documents, non-existent sources, and originates from a Russian disinformation campaign aimed at undermining Ukraine and its leadership. The Kehlsteinhaus is still owned by the Free State of Bavaria, and all evidence cited in the viral posts has been thoroughly debunked by credible fact-checking sources and the property's rightful owner. The story serves as part of a broader influence effort to sow distrust and spread falsehoods about Ukraine in Western media and political spheres.;1. Claim Being Evaluated: The claim is that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy purchased Adolf Hitler’s former summer residence, the Kehlsteinhaus (Eagle’s Nest), for over 100 million kroner, allegedly using financial aid funds received from the United States.2. Key Evidence Provided: - Official Denial from Property Owner: The Kehlsteinhaus is owned by the Bavarian state through the company Immobilien Freistaat Bayern (IMBY), which has publicly stated that no sale has occurred and that the building remains state-owned. - Fabrication of “Proof”: The purchase contract and quotes circulating online were determined to be fake. IMBY confirmed that the statements attributed to its management were fabricated. - Source of the Claim: The story was published by a website called Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland, which was revealed to be a fake media outlet tied to a Russian disinformation campaign known as Storm-1516, linked to the GRU and the Internet Research Agency (IRA). - Disinformation Pattern: The claim fits into a known pattern of anti-Zelenskyy propaganda, similar to previously debunked stories (e.g., about luxury purchases allegedly made by Zelenskyy or his family).3. Verdict and Justification: Verdict: False The claim is demonstrably false. It is based on fabricated documents, non-existent quotes, and was spread by a fake news site operating as part of a Russian disinformation campaign. The legitimate property owner, IMBY, has provided clear, verifiable evidence that no sale occurred. There is no factual basis for the claim, and it is part of a broader effort to discredit Ukrainian leadership and influence public opinion through misinformation.;Zelenskyy's Purchase of Hitler's 'Eagle's Nest' Debunked as False;1. Identify and explain the claim:  The central claim being evaluated is that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy purchased Adolf Hitler's former summer house, the Kehlsteinhaus (also known as the Eagle's Nest), for more than 100 million kroner. This claim appeared in several posts on social media platforms like X and Facebook, often linking the supposed purchase to the financial aid Ukraine receives from the United States. The posts sometimes included alleged purchase contracts and a video detailing the history of the building.2. Examine the main evidence:  The fact-check presents several pieces of evidence that contradict this claim:   Official Statement: Immobilien Freistaat Bayern (IMBY), the Bavarian state-owned company that actually owns the Kehlsteinhaus, explicitly stated on their website that the property remains under their ownership. They confirmed that no sale has occurred and that no sale is planned.   Fabricated Documents: IMBY also asserted that the alleged purchase contract shown in the shared video is false, as is the purported quote from their management regarding the sale.   Source Discrediting: The story originated from a website called Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland, which, despite its German-sounding name, is identified as a newly created Russian propaganda outlet. This website showed no activity before December 14, 2024, and is listed among fake websites associated with Russian disinformation campaigns.   Pattern of Disinformation: This false claim aligns with other previously debunked stories about President Zelenskyy, such as his wife supposedly buying a Bugatti and him purchasing a casino in Cyprus, suggesting a coordinated effort to spread misinformation.3. Conclude with the verdict and reasoning:  The final verdict of the fact-check is false. The claim that Volodymyr Zelenskyy purchased Hitler's Kehlsteinhaus is untrue due to the following key reasons:   The actual owner of the property, IMBY, has authoritatively denied the sale and identified the alleged evidence as fabricated.   The source of the information is a website strongly linked to Russian disinformation efforts, making its claims highly unreliable.   The claim fits a pattern of other debunked false stories targeting President Zelenskyy, indicating a likely disinformation campaign.In essence, the fact-check thoroughly debunks the claim by providing direct evidence from the property owner and exposing the questionable and likely malicious origin of the information.;Understood, let's break down the fact-check to determine the verdict:1. Identify the claim being evaluated:  The claim being evaluated is that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy purchased Adolf Hitler's former summer residence, the Kehlsteinhaus (also known as the Eagle's Nest), for more than 100 million kroner.2. Review the key evidence provided to assess the claim:   The primary evidence against the claim comes from the Immobilien Freistaat Bayern (IMBY), the Bavarian state-owned company that owns the Kehlsteinhaus. They explicitly stated that the property remains in their ownership and no sale has occurred or is planned. They also declared the alleged purchase contract and quotes to be false.   The fact-check identifies the source of the claim as a website called Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland, which is strongly suspected to be a Russian propaganda outlet created to spread disinformation. This website has no significant history prior to the claim's emergence.   The claim is presented as part of a broader pattern of disinformation targeting President Zelenskyy, with previous false stories about luxury purchases also traced to dubious sources.3. Based on this evidence, determine the verdict:  Based on the overwhelming evidence, the claim is False.  Justification:  The official owners of the Kehlsteinhaus have directly and unequivocally denied the sale, labeling the alleged evidence as fabricated. Furthermore, the claim originates from a website identified as likely being part of a Russian disinformation campaign. The context of similar debunked claims against President Zelenskyy further supports the conclusion that this is a fabricated story intended to spread misinformation.;Volodymyr Zelensky did not buy Hitler's summer house;1. Claim Being Evaluated The claim being evaluated is that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has purchased Adolf Hitler's old summer house, Kehlsteinhaus (also known as the Eagle's Nest), for over 100 million kroner. This claim suggests that Zelensky has acquired a property with historical significance, previously owned by Hitler, and has done so using a substantial amount of money. 2. Main Evidence Provided The main evidence provided to assess the truthfulness of this claim includes: Statement from the Owner: A statement from the state-owned Bavarian company Immobilien Freistaat Bayern (IMBY), which owns the property, denying that a sale has taken place. Denial of Authenticity: IMBY's denial of the authenticity of an alleged purchase contract and a quote from their management that was presented in a video. Source of the Claim: The source of the claim, Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland, is a Russian propaganda outlet created to spread disinformation, with links to the Russian troll factory Internet Research Agency (IRA) and the Russian military intelligence service GRU. Website History: The website Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland has no history or credibility, and was only created in December 2024, suggesting it was created specifically to spread false information. 3. Verdict and Justification The verdict given in the fact-check is FALSE. The reasons for this conclusion are: Owner's Denial: The owner's explicit denial of the sale, combined with the lack of credible evidence supporting the claim, strongly suggests that the claim is false. Suspicious Source: The claim originated from a Russian propaganda outlet with a history of spreading disinformation, which suggests that the claim is part of a larger effort to spread false information about Ukraine and its leadership. Lack of Credible Evidence: The alleged purchase contract and quote from IMBY's management were found to be false, further supporting the conclusion that the claim is false.Overall, the fact-check concludes that the claim is false, and that it is part of a broader disinformation campaign aimed at undermining Ukraine and its president.; Step 1: Identify the claim being evaluatedThe claim being evaluated is that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has purchased Adolf Hitler's old summer house, Kehlsteinhaus, also known as the Eagle's Nest, for more than 100 million kroner. 2: Review the key evidence provided to assess the claimThe key evidence provided includes:- The claim was made by several posts on social media platforms X and Facebook.- These posts included photos of alleged purchase contracts and a video detailing the building's history.- The posts claimed the story came from German media, specifically mentioning Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland.- However, investigations revealed that Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland is likely a Russian propaganda outlet created to spread disinformation.- The Bavarian company Immobilien Freistaat Bayern (IMBY), which manages the Kehlsteinhaus, stated that the building remains in the ownership of the Free State of Bavaria, and no sale has taken place or is planned.- The alleged purchase contract and quote from IMBY's management were found to be false. 3: Determine the verdict based on the evidenceGiven the evidence, the claim that Volodymyr Zelensky purchased Hitler's summer house is false. The German media outlet cited is actually a Russian propaganda site with no credibility, and the company responsible for the Kehlsteinhaus confirms that no sale has occurred.The final answer is: $\boxed{False}$;Zelensky Did Not Buy Hitler’s Eagle’s Nest: Russian Disinformation Debunked;1. Claim Being Evaluated:  The core claim being evaluated is that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky purchased Adolf Hitler's former summer house, Kehlsteinhaus (also known as the Eagle's Nest), for more than 100 million kroner. This assertion, widely circulated on social media platforms like X and Facebook, further suggests a connection between the alleged purchase and U.S. financial aid provided to Ukraine for its war against Russia, implying misuse of these funds. The claim is accompanied by alleged purchase contracts, a video detailing the building’s history, and references to a supposed sale to an Italian company owned by Zelensky, reportedly covered by German media.2. Main Evidence Provided:  - Statement from Immobilien Freistaat Bayern (IMBY): IMBY, the Bavarian state-owned company that owns Kehlsteinhaus, issued a clear statement on their website denying any sale of the property. They confirmed that Kehlsteinhaus remains in their ownership, no sale is planned, and the alleged purchase contract and a quoted statement from their director, Gerhard Reichel, are fabricated. IMBY also announced plans to take legal action against those spreading the false information.  - Identification of Disinformation Source: The claim originates from a supposed German media outlet, Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland, which was found to be a Russian propaganda website. Fact-checkers, including TjekDet and Correctiv, determined that this site was created on December 14, 2024, with no prior activity or credibility. It is part of the Storm-1516 operation, linked to the Russian Internet Research Agency (IRA) and GRU, aimed at spreading disinformation ahead of the German elections on February 23, 2025.  - Lack of Credible Corroboration: No reputable German media outlets or other reliable sources support the claim. The only source, Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland, is a disinformation platform mimicking legitimate news sites, a tactic used to blend false stories with real ones to gain credibility.  - Broader Context of Anti-Ukrainian Disinformation: The fact-check highlights similar false narratives targeting Zelensky, such as claims about his wife purchasing a Bugatti or Zelensky buying a hotel casino in Cyprus. These stories follow a pattern of Russian disinformation campaigns, as noted by analysts from NewsGuard and the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, which aim to discredit Zelensky and strain Ukraine’s alliances, particularly with the U.S. The resurgence of such narratives was linked to comments by U.S. President Donald Trump calling Zelensky a dictator.3. Verdict and Justification:  - Verdict: False  - Reasons and Arguments:   - Authoritative Denial: IMBY’s unequivocal statement that Kehlsteinhaus has not been sold and that the documents and statements are fabricated provides direct evidence refuting the claim. As the property’s owner, IMBY is the most credible source on this matter.   - Disinformation Source: The claim’s origin from Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland, a recently created Russian propaganda outlet with no journalistic legitimacy, undermines its validity. Its inclusion in Correctiv’s list of 100 fake websites tied to Russian disinformation efforts further confirms its unreliability.   - Pattern of Propaganda: The claim fits into a broader Russian strategy to spread false stories about Zelensky, as evidenced by prior debunked claims and expert analysis from NewsGuard and the Institute for Strategic Dialogue. This context strengthens the conclusion that the claim is a deliberate fabrication to weaken Ukraine’s international support.   - No Supporting Evidence: Beyond the fabricated documents and the propaganda outlet, no credible evidence or media coverage supports the claim, making it baseless.  The combination of IMBY’s denial, the exposure of the source as Russian disinformation, and the absence of any verifiable evidence conclusively proves the claim is false. The fact-check also underscores the claim’s role in a larger Russian influence campaign, particularly amplified by U.S. political rhetoric, to sow discord and undermine Ukraine.;1. Claim Being Evaluated:  The claim being evaluated is that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky purchased Adolf Hitler's former summer house, Kehlsteinhaus (also known as the Eagle's Nest), for more than 100 million kroner. The claim, spread through social media posts on X and Facebook, alleges that the purchase was facilitated through an Italian company owned by Zelensky and connects it to U.S. aid provided to Ukraine for its war against Russia, suggesting misuse of funds.2. Key Evidence Provided:  - Statement from Immobilien Freistaat Bayern (IMBY): IMBY, the Bavarian state-owned company that owns Kehlsteinhaus, explicitly stated that the property has not been sold, remains in their ownership, and no sale is planned. They also confirmed that the alleged purchase contract and a quoted statement attributed to their director, Gerhard Reichel, are fabricated. IMBY announced plans to pursue legal action against those spreading the false information.  - Disinformation Source Identified: The claim originates from Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland, a supposed German media outlet identified as a Russian propaganda website created on December 14, 2024. It is part of the Storm-1516 operation, linked to the Russian Internet Research Agency (IRA) and GRU, aimed at spreading disinformation ahead of the German elections on February 23, 2025, as confirmed by the German fact-checking outlet Correctiv.  - Lack of Credible Corroboration: No reputable German media or other reliable sources support the claim. The only source is the aforementioned propaganda outlet, which uses fabricated documents and a misleading video to promote the story.  - Context of Russian Disinformation: The claim aligns with a pattern of false narratives targeting Zelensky, such as claims about luxury purchases (e.g., a Bugatti or a Cyprus casino), which have also been debunked. Analysts from NewsGuard and the Institute for Strategic Dialogue note a resurgence of anti-Ukrainian disinformation, amplified by U.S. President Donald Trump’s remarks calling Zelensky a dictator, aimed at undermining Ukraine’s alliances.3. Verdict and Justification:  - Verdict: False  - Justification:   - Direct Refutation by Property Owner: IMBY’s authoritative statement as the owner of Kehlsteinhaus confirms that no sale has occurred, directly contradicting the claim. Their assertion that the purchase contract and related statements are fabricated eliminates any basis for the claim.   - Unreliable Source: The sole source, Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland, is a Russian disinformation outlet with no journalistic credibility, created specifically to spread propaganda. Its identification as part of a broader Russian influence operation (Storm-1516) by Correctiv further discredits the claim.   - Absence of Supporting Evidence: No credible media, documents, or witnesses corroborate the claim. The reliance on fabricated materials and a propaganda outlet underscores its falsehood.   - Broader Disinformation Pattern: The claim fits into a well-documented Russian strategy to spread false stories about Zelensky to discredit him and weaken Ukraine’s international support, as evidenced by similar debunked claims and expert analysis from NewsGuard and the Institute for Strategic Dialogue.  Based on this evidence, the claim is entirely baseless and part of a deliberate disinformation campaign, justifying the verdict of False.

But the story is fabricated and is in all likelihood an example of Russian disinformation.  According to researchers, false allegations about the Ukrainian president have flared up after Donald Trump called the Ukrainian president a dictator.;This is the fact-checkUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has purchased Adolf Hitler's old summer house, Kehlsteinhaus, also known as the Eagle's Nest, for more than 100 million kroner.This is the claim in several posts on both X and Facebook , which also link the summer house purchase with the aid that Ukraine receives from the United States to wage war on Russia. The posts have been viewed hundreds of thousands of times.The posts include photos of alleged purchase contracts and a video detailing the building's history as Adolf Hitler's summer residence, while explaining that the house has now been sold to an Italian company owned by the Ukrainian president.According to the posts, the story about the summer house purchase comes from German media, but the only German media outlet that TjekDet has been able to find the story from is the unknown Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland .It turns out that the German media is actually a Russian propaganda outlet. And Zelenskyy did not buy Hitler's summer house.Hitler's summer residenceKehlsteinhaus was given to Hitler in 1939 as a 50th birthday present by German Nazi politician Martin Bormann. The building gets its name because it is located on the top of the Kehlstein mountain, a whopping 1,834 meters above sea level.Hitler's visits to the house were few and far between, however , because he disliked the heights and the elevator that had to be used to reach the house at the time. The risk of lightning strikes was also not a weather forecast that the German dictator liked.The video, now being shared on social media, shows that President Zelenskyy has purchased the building from the state-owned Bavarian company Immobilien Freistaat Bayern (IMBY), whose director, Gerhard Reichel , according to the video, comments on the sale as follows:“Such transactions with historic sites are very rare. However, in this case, due to the high state subsidy required to ensure the ongoing operation (of the building, ed.), it was only a matter of time before a sale would take place,” it says.But the statement and the sale of Kehlsteinhaus are, according to IMBY, pure fabrication.“The Kehlsteinhaus remains in the ownership of the Free State of Bavaria. A sale has not taken place and is not planned. The alleged purchase contract shown in the video is false, as is the alleged quote from the IMBY management,” IMBY states on their website .They also state that they will take legal action against those who spread the false information on the internet.Volodymyr Zelenskyj bought the Kehlsteinhaus, which previously belonged to Hitler, writes the media outlet Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland, which is apparently German. But the website hides a secret. Photo: Screenshot.The arrow points towards RussiaAs mentioned, the false story was published by the “German” media outlet Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland, and it is most likely a website created for the purpose of spreading Russian disinformation.CheckDet has not been able to find any traces of the media website from before December 14, 2024. According to various services that monitor changes to websites, the first activity on the website was seen on that very day. It was also on December 14 that the website was first archived through the Wayback Machine service.If you search for the website on Google, there are no results from before December 2024.The website also appears on the list of 100 fake websites that, among others, the German fact-checking media Correctiv has identified as being created with the aim of spreading Russian disinformation ahead of the German elections on February 23, 2025.Correctiv has dubbed the influence operation Storm-1516, and according to the media outlet, the operation has links to the Russian troll factory Internet Research Agency (IRA) and the Russian military intelligence service GRU.The false story also ties in with many other stories about Volodymyr Zelenskyj, which TjekDet has previously fact-checked. Among other things, the president's wife is said to have acquired a Bugatti , and Zelenskyj himself is said to have bought a hotel casino in Cyprus .And the strategy seems to be the same.The Bugatti story was also published on a newly created website that, like Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland, imitates a real news site, where a few fake ones are planted among a sea of true stories - typically with an angle on Russia. Probably to strengthen credibility.Reaction to Trump's dictator accusationThe news outlet AFP writes that false allegations about Volodymyr Zelensky have flared up after US President Donald Trump, among other things, called the Ukrainian president a dictator.We have observed a significant resurgence of anti-Ukrainian disinformation on US social media, much of which appears to be recycled content from previous Russian influence campaigns, McKenzie Sadeghi, an analyst at disinformation watchdog NewsGuard, told AFP .Trump's comments appear to have sparked renewed interest in anti-Ukrainian narratives that had previously faded, Sadeghi further told AFP .Joseph Bodnar, a researcher at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, explains to AFP that the Russian influence attempts focus on creating animosity between the Trump and Zelenskyy administrations.Russia wants to convince American negotiators that Ukraine is their enemy, not their ally.

The fact-check also highlights that the story originated from a newly created and likely Russian propaganda website, Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland, further discrediting the claim.3.

They confirmed the alleged purchase contract and quoted statements are fabricated and plan legal action against those spreading the falsehood.  - Disinformation Source: The claim originates from Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland, a Russian propaganda website created in December 2024, part of the Storm-1516 operation linked to the Russian Internet Research Agency (IRA) and GRU, as identified by Correctiv.  - No Credible Support: No reputable German media or sources corroborate the claim, which relies on fabricated documents and a misleading video.  - Disinformation Pattern: The claim aligns with other false anti-Zelensky narratives (e.g., Bugatti, Cyprus casino purchases), part of a Russian strategy to discredit him, as noted by NewsGuard and the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, amplified by U.S. political rhetoric.Final Verdict:The claim that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky purchased Adolf Hitler’s Kehlsteinhaus for over 100 million kroner is False. This verdict is supported by IMBY’s authoritative statement confirming no sale occurred and that the purchase contract is fabricated, the claim’s origin from a Russian propaganda outlet (Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland) with no credibility, and the complete lack of reputable corroboration. The claim’s alignment with a broader Russian disinformation campaign targeting Zelensky, as evidenced by similar debunked stories and expert analysis, further confirms its falsehood.
FC_03;Bullet point summary;Has Zelensky bought Hitler's old summer residence?;Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has purchased Adolf Hitler's former summer home, according to several posts on social media.  But the story is fabricated and is in all likelihood an example of Russian disinformation.  According to researchers, false allegations about the Ukrainian president have flared up after Donald Trump called the Ukrainian president a dictator.;This is the fact-checkUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has purchased Adolf Hitler's old summer house, Kehlsteinhaus, also known as the Eagle's Nest, for more than 100 million kroner.This is the claim in several posts on both X and Facebook , which also link the summer house purchase with the aid that Ukraine receives from the United States to wage war on Russia. The posts have been viewed hundreds of thousands of times.The posts include photos of alleged purchase contracts and a video detailing the building's history as Adolf Hitler's summer residence, while explaining that the house has now been sold to an Italian company owned by the Ukrainian president.According to the posts, the story about the summer house purchase comes from German media, but the only German media outlet that TjekDet has been able to find the story from is the unknown Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland .It turns out that the German media is actually a Russian propaganda outlet. And Zelenskyy did not buy Hitler's summer house.Hitler's summer residenceKehlsteinhaus was given to Hitler in 1939 as a 50th birthday present by German Nazi politician Martin Bormann. The building gets its name because it is located on the top of the Kehlstein mountain, a whopping 1,834 meters above sea level.Hitler's visits to the house were few and far between, however , because he disliked the heights and the elevator that had to be used to reach the house at the time. The risk of lightning strikes was also not a weather forecast that the German dictator liked.The video, now being shared on social media, shows that President Zelenskyy has purchased the building from the state-owned Bavarian company Immobilien Freistaat Bayern (IMBY), whose director, Gerhard Reichel , according to the video, comments on the sale as follows:“Such transactions with historic sites are very rare. However, in this case, due to the high state subsidy required to ensure the ongoing operation (of the building, ed.), it was only a matter of time before a sale would take place,” it says.But the statement and the sale of Kehlsteinhaus are, according to IMBY, pure fabrication.“The Kehlsteinhaus remains in the ownership of the Free State of Bavaria. A sale has not taken place and is not planned. The alleged purchase contract shown in the video is false, as is the alleged quote from the IMBY management,” IMBY states on their website .They also state that they will take legal action against those who spread the false information on the internet.Volodymyr Zelenskyj bought the Kehlsteinhaus, which previously belonged to Hitler, writes the media outlet Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland, which is apparently German. But the website hides a secret. Photo: Screenshot.The arrow points towards RussiaAs mentioned, the false story was published by the “German” media outlet Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland, and it is most likely a website created for the purpose of spreading Russian disinformation.CheckDet has not been able to find any traces of the media website from before December 14, 2024. According to various services that monitor changes to websites, the first activity on the website was seen on that very day. It was also on December 14 that the website was first archived through the Wayback Machine service.If you search for the website on Google, there are no results from before December 2024.The website also appears on the list of 100 fake websites that, among others, the German fact-checking media Correctiv has identified as being created with the aim of spreading Russian disinformation ahead of the German elections on February 23, 2025.Correctiv has dubbed the influence operation Storm-1516, and according to the media outlet, the operation has links to the Russian troll factory Internet Research Agency (IRA) and the Russian military intelligence service GRU.The false story also ties in with many other stories about Volodymyr Zelenskyj, which TjekDet has previously fact-checked. Among other things, the president's wife is said to have acquired a Bugatti , and Zelenskyj himself is said to have bought a hotel casino in Cyprus .And the strategy seems to be the same.The Bugatti story was also published on a newly created website that, like Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland, imitates a real news site, where a few fake ones are planted among a sea of true stories - typically with an angle on Russia. Probably to strengthen credibility.Reaction to Trump's dictator accusationThe news outlet AFP writes that false allegations about Volodymyr Zelensky have flared up after US President Donald Trump, among other things, called the Ukrainian president a dictator.We have observed a significant resurgence of anti-Ukrainian disinformation on US social media, much of which appears to be recycled content from previous Russian influence campaigns, McKenzie Sadeghi, an analyst at disinformation watchdog NewsGuard, told AFP .Trump's comments appear to have sparked renewed interest in anti-Ukrainian narratives that had previously faded, Sadeghi further told AFP .Joseph Bodnar, a researcher at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, explains to AFP that the Russian influence attempts focus on creating animosity between the Trump and Zelenskyy administrations.Russia wants to convince American negotiators that Ukraine is their enemy, not their ally. It is a means for the Kremlin to obtain favorable terms in any peace agreement that may come.;Role;Claim That Zelenskyy Purchased Hitler's Kehlsteinhaus for 100 Million Krone is False;Claim: The claim being evaluated is that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy purchased Adolf Hitler's former summer house, Kehlsteinhaus (Eagle's Nest), for over 100 million kroner.Evidence: The fact-check reveals that Kehlsteinhaus remains under the ownership of the Free State of Bavaria (IMBY), not Zelenskyy. The alleged purchase contract and quotes from IMBY officials are false, as IMBY has publicly denied the sale. Additionally, the source of the false claim, the website Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland, is linked to Russian disinformation campaigns. IMBY also stated they would take legal action against those spreading the false information.Verdict: False. The claim that Zelenskyy bought Kehlsteinhaus is not supported by any credible evidence, and it has been debunked by both the property owner and experts in disinformation.;1. Claim being assessed: The claim is that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy purchased Adolf Hitler's former summer house, Kehlsteinhaus, for over 100 million kroner.2. Final verdict: False.3. Explanation: The evidence shows that Kehlsteinhaus remains owned by the Free State of Bavaria (IMBY), not Zelenskyy. The claim of a sale is based on a fabricated purchase contract and false statements attributed to IMBY. The source of the claim, the website Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland, is a disinformation outlet linked to Russian propaganda efforts. IMBY has publicly denied the sale and announced plans for legal action, further debunking the claim. Therefore, the claim is false.;Zelenskyy's Hitler 'Eagle's Nest' Purchase: False Claim Debunked;1. Claim: The fact-check evaluated the claim that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy purchased Adolf Hitler's former summer residence, the Kehlsteinhaus (Eagle's Nest).2. Evidence: The key evidence against this claim was the official statement from Immobilien Freistaat Bayern (IMBY), the actual owners of the Kehlsteinhaus. They explicitly denied any sale, stating that the property remains under their ownership and that the alleged purchase contracts and quotes were fabricated. Additionally, the source of the claim was identified as Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland, a website suspected of being a Russian propaganda outlet, which significantly undermines the claim's credibility.3. Verdict: The claim is false. The direct denial from the property's owners, coupled with the dubious source of the information, clearly demonstrates that the claim is a fabrication. The evidence provided no support for the claim, and showed that the information was part of a disinformation campaign.;Alright, as a professional fact-checker, here's the verdict:1. What is the claim being assessed?   The claim being assessed is that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy purchased Adolf Hitler's former summer residence, the Kehlsteinhaus (Eagle's Nest).2. What is the final verdict (true, false, mixed, another relevant verdict category)?   The final verdict is false.3. Explain how the evidence supports the verdict in a clear and concise manner.   The primary evidence comes from Immobilien Freistaat Bayern (IMBY), the actual owners of the Kehlsteinhaus. They explicitly stated that the property remains under their ownership and that no sale has occurred or is planned. They also declared the alleged purchase contracts and quotes to be fabricated.   Furthermore, the claim originated from a website, Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland, which is strongly suspected to be a Russian propaganda outlet. This source is unreliable, which discredits the claim.   In short, the owners of the property denied the sale, and the information originated from a known disinformation source. There is no evidence supporting the claim.;False: Volodymyr Zelensky Did Not Buy Hitler's Kehlsteinhaus;Claim:The claim being evaluated is that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has purchased Adolf Hitler's old summer house, Kehlsteinhaus, also known as the Eagle's Nest. Evidence:- The claim originated from Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland, identified as a Russian propaganda outlet created to spread disinformation.- The Bavarian company Immobilien Freistaat Bayern (IMBY), which manages Kehlsteinhaus, confirms that the building remains in the ownership of the Free State of Bavaria.- IMBY explicitly states that no sale has taken place and that the alleged purchase contract and quotes circulating online are false. Verdict:Based on the evidence, the claim is false. The fact-check reveals that the source of the claim is unreliable and that the managing company of Kehlsteinhaus denies the sale, providing clear evidence that Volodymyr Zelensky did not purchase the property. This conclusion is supported by credible sources and directly contradicts the disinformation spread by Russian propaganda outlets.; Fact-Check Verdict: 1. Claim Being Assessed:The claim being assessed is that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has purchased Adolf Hitler's old summer house, Kehlsteinhaus, also known as the Eagle's Nest. 2. Final Verdict:The final verdict is that the claim is false. 3. Evidence Supporting the Verdict:The evidence clearly supports this verdict for the following reasons:- The source of the claim, Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland, is identified as a Russian propaganda outlet with no credible history before December 14, 2024. This raises significant doubts about the reliability of the information.- The Bavarian company Immobilien Freistaat Bayern (IMBY), which manages Kehlsteinhaus, confirms that the building remains in the ownership of the Free State of Bavaria. This directly contradicts the claim of a sale to Volodymyr Zelensky.- IMBY further states that the alleged purchase contract and quotes circulating online are false, providing explicit denial of the claim.Given these facts, the claim that Volodymyr Zelensky purchased Kehlsteinhaus is false. The credible evidence from the managing company of the property and the identification of the claim's source as a disinformation outlet support this conclusion.;False: Zelensky Did Not Purchase Hitler’s Eagle’s Nest, Claim Traced to Russian Propaganda;1. Claim: The fact-check evaluates the assertion that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky purchased Adolf Hitler's former summer house, Kehlsteinhaus (Eagle's Nest), for over 100 million kroner. The claim, spread on social media, alleges the purchase was made through an Italian company owned by Zelensky and suggests misuse of U.S. aid provided for Ukraine’s war against Russia.2. Evidence:  - Official Denial: Immobilien Freistaat Bayern (IMBY), the Bavarian state-owned company that owns Kehlsteinhaus, stated the property has not been sold, remains in their possession, and no sale is planned. They confirmed the alleged purchase contract and related statements are fake and plan to take legal action.  - Russian Propaganda Source: The claim comes from Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland, a fake German media outlet identified as a Russian propaganda site, created in December 2024. It is part of a Russian disinformation campaign (Storm-1516) linked to the Internet Research Agency and GRU, per Correctiv’s findings.  - No Credible Support: No reputable media or sources back the claim, which relies on fabricated documents and a misleading video.  - Pattern of Disinformation: The claim fits a Russian strategy to spread false stories about Zelensky, similar to debunked claims about luxury purchases, aimed at undermining Ukraine’s alliances, as noted by NewsGuard and the Institute for Strategic Dialogue.3. Verdict: False. The evidence clearly shows the claim is fabricated. IMBY’s definitive statement as the property owner confirms no sale occurred, and the claim’s origin from a Russian propaganda outlet with no credibility seals its falsehood. The lack of any supporting evidence and the claim’s role in a broader disinformation campaign targeting Zelensky explain why it is entirely untrue.;1. Claim Being Assessed: The claim is that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky purchased Adolf Hitler's former summer house, Kehlsteinhaus (Eagle's Nest), for more than 100 million kroner, allegedly through an Italian company and linked to U.S. aid for Ukraine’s war against Russia, implying misuse of funds.2. Final Verdict: False3. Explanation of Evidence Supporting the Verdict:  The verdict of False is supported by robust evidence. Immobilien Freistaat Bayern (IMBY), the Bavarian state-owned company that owns Kehlsteinhaus, confirmed the property has not been sold, remains in their ownership, and no sale is planned, directly refuting the claim. IMBY also stated that the alleged purchase contract and quoted statements are fabricated, and they intend to pursue legal action. The claim originates from Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland, a fake German media outlet identified as a Russian propaganda site, created in December 2024 as part of the Storm-1516 operation tied to the Russian Internet Research Agency and GRU, according to Correctiv. No credible sources or media support the claim, which relies on falsified documents. Additionally, the claim aligns with a pattern of Russian disinformation targeting Zelensky, as confirmed by NewsGuard and the Institute for Strategic Dialogue. The combination of IMBY’s authoritative denial, the discredited source, and the absence of any verifiable evidence clearly demonstrates the claim is entirely false.

FC_04;Lead;Green trees in February 1722 not proof of climate change;Green trees in February 1722 not proof of climate change;This is the fact-check :For several years, a newspaper clipping with the headline “In February 1722, all the trees were completely green” has been circulating among climate skeptics on social media. The Source Criticism Agency is investigating the origin of the image – and the truth behind its content.It turns out that the anecdotal article doesn't actually say anything about the climate. And when we dig deeper into the archives, it turns out that large parts of the text aren't even about Swedish conditions – but about the weather in Germany.Post on Facebook with the image April 23, 2024.This is the text in what appears to be a photocopied newspaper article:  In February 1722, all the trees were completely green  . There have certainly been mild winters in the past. Gunnar Carlberg, who is also SMHI's precipitation monitor in Finspång, has looked through old scrapbooks and found the following interesting statistics:  In 1172, the winter was so mild that the trees turned green at the end of January. The birds built their nests and molted in February.  In 1241, the trees were fully leafed out in March.  In 1269, there was no winter at all.  In 1421, the trees bloomed in March and the vines in April, when there were also ripe gooseberries.  In 1538, the trees in the gardens were in full bloom already in December!  In 1585, the corn was in ear at Easter time.  In 1588, the trees turned green in February.  In 1538, 1607, 1617, 1650 and 1659, there was neither snow nor frost.  In 1722, all the trees were green in February.  In 1863, in Skåne, you could pick fully bloomed daisies in February.  NT Wednesday, February 15, 1989 The source criticism agency begins by examining the context in which the image was shared. The first post we find is from 2015 on the blog Klimatupplysningen, which is run by Klimatrealisterna, formerly the Stockholm Initiative. In 2010, the lobby group Stockholm Initiative was named Misleader of the Year by the public education association Vetenskap och Folkbildning . In the book “Upphettning: demokratin i klimatkrisens tid” (published in 2020 by the publisher Fri tanke), the Climate Realists are identified as “the hub of the Swedish denial movement”.  It was on Christmas Eve 2015 that Klimatupplysningen posted the image, stating that it came from a reader. The blog post has 112 comments.Commentary on Klimatupplysningen's blog post 2015.However, it will take five years for the image to truly go viral. Most of the shares we find are from 2020. The newspaper clipping appears on Twitter;Vanilla;No, Trees Weren’t Green in February 1722 in Sweden — Viral Claim Is False and Misleading;A widely circulated newspaper clipping claiming that “all the trees were completely green in February 1722” has been used by climate skeptics to cast doubt on human-driven climate change. But a closer look reveals that the article is not only misleading—it’s largely based on anecdotal weather notes from Germany, not Sweden, and its supposed scientific authority is fabricated. The viral image traces back to a 1944 American-Swedish publication, was republished in a Swedish local paper in 1989 with no clear attribution, and is now resurfacing online to promote false claims about climate history.;Verdict: FalseThe claim that all the trees were completely green in February 1722 in Sweden—and that this proves climate change is natural and not human-caused—is false. The original source of the claim is a decades-old article referencing historical weather anecdotes, many of which describe conditions in Germany, not Sweden. The information has been reshaped over time and falsely attributed to a representative of Sweden’s weather authority, SMHI. Scientific consensus, supported by extensive and reliable data, confirms that current global warming is primarily driven by human activity—not natural weather variation.;Old Newspaper Clipping Misused to Debunk Climate Change: Fact-Check Reveals False Claims and German Origins;Fact-check: A widely shared newspaper clipping from 1989, headlined In February 1722, all the trees were completely green, is being used by climate skeptics on social media to suggest that mild winters are nothing new and that human activity doesn't significantly impact the climate. However, an investigation reveals that the article doesn't actually focus on climate trends and that large portions of its content originate from a 1944 article in a Swedish-American newspaper discussing weather in Germany. Furthermore, the reference to an SMHI precipitation monitor as the source of the historical anecdotes appears to be inaccurate. While the original newspaper article did exist, its resurfacing decades later on social media misrepresents its content and context to undermine established scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change.;Verdict: False and MisleadingThe claim that the newspaper clipping proves that current mild winters and early greening of trees are natural occurrences unrelated to human-caused climate change is false and misleading.Here's why: Misrepresented Content: The article itself doesn't make claims about climate trends. Dubious Sourcing: The cited source, a supposed SMHI precipitation monitor, is likely inaccurate, and the historical anecdotes were collected privately, not as part of any official climate record. German Origins: A significant portion of the text originates from a 1944 article about weather in Germany, not Sweden. Lack of Scientific Rigor: The anecdotes are isolated weather observations, not part of continuous, long-term data needed to assess climate trends. Contradicts Scientific Consensus: The overwhelming scientific consensus, as stated by the IPCC, is that human influence is unequivocally warming the climate.Therefore, using this newspaper clipping to dismiss the impact of human activity on the climate is a misrepresentation of the article's content and a contradiction of established scientific findings.;Viral Claim About 1722 'Green February' Misleads on Climate Change;A viral newspaper clipping claims that in February 1722, all trees were completely green, citing a supposed article from Norrköpings Tidningar (NT) dated February 15, 1989. However, fact-checking reveals that the article's origins are murky, and its content is likely about German weather conditions rather than Swedish climate trends. Here's what the investigation uncovered [1]:The Original Article : The NT article does exist, but its source reference to Gunnar Carlberg, a supposed precipitation monitor for SMHI, is dubious. There's no record of Carlberg working for SMHI, but an Inez Carlberg was a precipitation observer in Finspång during the 1980s.The Real Source : The article's text bears a striking resemblance to a 1944 article from Vestkusten, a Swedish-language newspaper published in California. The Vestkusten article attributes the statistics to Sv. Landsbygden, likely short for Svenska Landsbygden.Climate vs. Weather : Experts emphasize that the article's scattered weather observations say nothing about long-term climate trends. Climate change research relies on continuous, longer time series and larger geographical areas.Human Influence : According to the IPCC, human activities, mainly greenhouse gas emissions, have unequivocally warmed the climate system. Natural climate variations exist, but human influence is the dominant factor in current global warming.The image has been used to mislead people about climate change, but evidence suggests that human activities are significantly contributing to global warming.;The claim about the newspaper clipping In February 1722, all the trees were completely green is misleading. Here's why ¹:  Origin: The article's origin is dubious, with evidence suggesting it was adapted from a 1944 article in Vestkusten, a Swedish-language newspaper published in California, rather than being a genuine 1989 article from Norrköpings Tidningar (NT) about Swedish conditions.  Content: The article's content is likely about German weather conditions, not Swedish climate trends. Experts emphasize that scattered weather observations say nothing about long-term climate trends.  Climate vs. Weather: The article blurs the line between climate and weather. Climate change research relies on continuous, longer time series and larger geographical areas, not anecdotal evidence.  Human Influence: According to the IPCC, human activities, mainly greenhouse gas emissions, have unequivocally warmed the climate system. Natural climate variations exist, but human influence is the dominant factor in current global warming.Given these points, the claim is rated false in the context of climate change, as it's being used to mislead people about human impact on the climate.;Viral 1722 'Green Trees' Claim Misleads on Climate Change, Proven False;A viral newspaper clipping from 1989, headlined “In February 1722, all the trees were completely green,” has been shared widely by climate skeptics to downplay human-driven climate change. The Source Criticism Agency’s investigation reveals the article, originally published in Norrköpings Tidningar, misrepresents historical weather data, largely references German conditions rather than Swedish, and lacks credible sourcing, undermining its use as evidence against modern climate science.;Verdict: FalseThe claim that the newspaper clipping proves human activity does not influence climate change is false. The article, originating from a 1989 Norrköpings Tidningar piece, is misleadingly presented as evidence of consistent natural climate variability in Sweden. It actually references historical weather anecdotes, many pertaining to Germany, not Sweden, and lacks credible sourcing or scientific rigor. Modern climate science, backed by the IPCC, unequivocally shows that human-induced greenhouse gas emissions are the primary driver of recent global warming, distinguishing it from natural weather variations. The clipping does not refute this evidence and is misused to support climate skepticism.

The newspaper clipping appears on Twitter;Ask-me-anything;Claim That Trees Were Green in Sweden in February 1722 Is False — Misleading Anecdote Misused to Deny Human-Caused Climate Change;A viral newspaper clipping shared widely on social media claims that “all the trees were completely green in February 1722” in Sweden—often cited by climate skeptics to argue that current climate change is just part of a natural cycle. However, this fact-check finds the claim to be false. The article originates not from scientific records but from a 1944 piece in a Swedish-American newspaper referencing anecdotal weather reports, many describing conditions in Germany, not Sweden. It was later republished in a Swedish local paper in 1989 with altered context, giving the false impression of official endorsement from the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI). Experts confirm that systematic weather measurements in Sweden didn’t begin until 1722, and while unusual weather may occur, isolated historical anecdotes do not disprove the overwhelming scientific consensus that modern global warming is driven by human activity.;1. What is the claim being verified? That in February 1722, all the trees in Sweden were completely green—used by climate skeptics to argue that current climate change is natural and not caused by human activity.2. What is the final verdict? False3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict? - The quote originates from a 1989 Swedish newspaper article, which appears to have copied a 1944 article from the Swedish-American newspaper Vestkusten.- The original text largely refers to anecdotal weather observations from Germany, not Sweden, and lacks credible sources or scientific basis.- The supposed expert cited in the 1989 article, a “precipitation monitor” named Gunnar Carlberg, cannot be confirmed as an SMHI employee or official authority.- Sweden’s first official weather measurements began in 1722 in Uppsala, meaning data from earlier years are unverifiable.- Climate scientists emphasize that isolated weather anecdotes cannot be used to draw conclusions about long-term climate trends.- Scientific consensus, supported by robust data, confirms that the rapid warming seen since the late 20th century is primarily caused by human greenhouse gas emissions—not natural variability.;Old Green Trees Article Falsely Used to Deny Climate Change: Fact-Check;Fact-check: A decades-old newspaper clipping, proclaiming In February 1722, all the trees were completely green, has resurfaced on social media, particularly among climate skeptics, who use it to argue that unusual weather events are natural and predate human-induced climate change. However, an investigation into the clipping's origins reveals that the article does not discuss climate trends, relies on questionable sourcing, and largely borrows historical weather observations from a 1944 article about German conditions published in a Swedish-American newspaper. Ultimately, the claim that this newspaper clipping disproves or undermines the reality of human-caused climate change is false and misleading. This verdict is based on evidence showing the misrepresentation of the article's content, its unreliable sourcing, its foreign origins, its focus on isolated weather events rather than long-term climate data, and its contradiction of the overwhelming scientific consensus on anthropogenic global warming.;1. What is the claim being verified? The claim being verified is whether a newspaper clipping from 1989, reporting that In February 1722, all the trees were completely green, provides evidence that current unusual weather events are natural variations unrelated to human-caused climate change.2. What is the final verdict? False and Misleading3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict?   Misrepresentation of Content: The newspaper article itself does not analyze climate trends or argue against human-caused climate change. It merely lists anecdotal reports of mild winters from various historical periods.   Questionable Sourcing: The article attributes these anecdotes to a supposed SMHI precipitation monitor who supposedly found them in old scrapbooks. This title is unusual, and SMHI has no record of such a role or the individual mentioned. The information was likely collected privately and not as part of any official climate data.   Plagiarism and Alteration: A significant portion of the text is nearly identical to an article published in a Swedish-American newspaper in 1944, which included observations about German weather. The 1989 article appears to have removed the German references and presented the information as relevant to Sweden, creating a misleading context.   Flawed Logic: Even if the historical anecdotes were accurate, isolated reports of mild winters do not negate the long-term trends and scientific evidence of global warming caused by human activity. Weather is distinct from climate, and individual events do not disprove broader climate patterns.   Contradiction of Scientific Consensus: The overwhelming scientific consensus, as stated by the IPCC, is that human influence is unequivocally warming the climate system. Using this altered and decontextualized newspaper clipping to argue otherwise is a direct contradiction of established scientific findings.;False Climate Claim: Viral 'Green February' Article Misleads on 1722 Weather;A viral newspaper clipping claims that in February 1722, all trees were completely green, and is being used to cast doubt on human-caused climate change. However, an investigation reveals that the article's origins are dubious, and its content is likely about German weather conditions rather than Swedish climate trends.The main evidence used to refute this claim comes from:The Original Article: A review of the NT article from February 15, 1989, reveals that it exists, but its source reference to Gunnar Carlberg, a supposed precipitation monitor for SMHI, is unsupported.The Real Source: A similar text was found in a 1944 article from Vestkusten, a Swedish-language newspaper published in California, which attributes the statistics to Sv. Landsbygden, likely short for Svenska Landsbygden.Expert Opinions: Climate scientists emphasize that scattered weather observations say nothing about long-term climate trends, and human activities, mainly greenhouse gas emissions, have unequivocally warmed the climate system.Given these points, the claim is rated misleading because it's being used to mislead people about climate change. The key reasons behind this verdict are:Lack of Authenticity: The article's origin is dubious, and its content is likely about German weather conditions.Misunderstanding Climate and Weather: The article blurs the line between climate and weather, and experts stress that anecdotal evidence doesn't prove anything about long-term climate trends.Human Influence: According to the IPCC, human activities are significantly contributing to global warming ¹.;The claim being verified is about a viral newspaper clipping stating that in February 1722, all trees were completely green. This claim is being used to cast doubt on human-caused climate change.The final verdict is False. The evidence supporting this verdict includes ¹:Dubuous Origin: The article's origin is likely from a 1944 article in Vestkusten, a Swedish-language newspaper published in California, rather than a genuine 1989 article from Norrköpings Tidningar (NT) about Swedish conditions.Misleading Content: The article's content is likely about German weather conditions, not Swedish climate trends. Experts emphasize that scattered weather observations say nothing about long-term climate trends.Climate vs. Weather: The article blurs the line between climate and weather. Climate change research relies on continuous, longer time series and larger geographical areas, not anecdotal evidence.Human Influence: According to the IPCC, human activities, mainly greenhouse gas emissions, have unequivocally warmed the climate system. Natural climate variations exist, but human influence is the dominant factor in current global warming.Overall, the claim is rated false because it's being used to mislead people about climate change, and the evidence provided does not support the claim.;1722 'Green Trees' Clipping Falsely Used to Deny Human-Driven Climate Change;A viral newspaper clipping from 1989, claiming mild winters like “all trees completely green” in February 1722 show climate has always varied naturally, is used by skeptics to deny human-driven climate change. The Source Criticism Agency’s investigation reveals the article, published in Norrköpings Tidningar, largely describes German weather, not Swedish, and relies on unverified anecdotes without scientific backing. The claim is false, as IPCC evidence confirms human greenhouse gas emissions drive recent global warming, distinct from historical weather fluctuations, rendering the clipping misleading and irrelevant to modern climate science.;1. Claim Being Verified: The claim is that a 1989 newspaper clipping, headlined “In February 1722, all the trees were completely green,” and listing historical mild winters, demonstrates that climate has always varied naturally, implying that human activity does not significantly influence modern climate change.2. Final Verdict: False3. Evidence and Reasoning Supporting the Verdict:  - Misrepresentation of Data: The newspaper article, published in Norrköpings Tidningar, is presented as evidence of consistent natural climate variability in Sweden. However, investigation reveals that much of the text refers to weather conditions in Germany, not Sweden, and is derived from a 1944 article in Vestkusten, a Swedish-American newspaper. The article was edited to omit references to Germany, creating a misleading narrative about Swedish climate.  - Lack of Credible Sourcing: The article cites a “Gunnar Carlberg” as a precipitation monitor for SMHI, but SMHI has no record of him, and the role does not involve historical weather analysis. The source of the historical anecdotes, referred to as “old scrapbooks,” is vague and unverifiable, especially for years like 1172, when no weather measurements existed in Sweden.  - Scientific Irrelevance: The anecdotes describe isolated weather events, not long-term climate trends. Climate science, as per the IPCC, shows that human-induced greenhouse gas emissions have driven unprecedented global warming since 1970, distinct from natural weather variations. The article’s snapshots of mild winters do not contradict this evidence.  - Context of Misuse: The clipping has been shared by climate skeptic groups, such as Klimatrealisterna, to argue against human-driven climate change. This ignores the scientific consensus that human activity is the primary driver of recent climate trends, making the claim false in its implication that historical weather variability negates anthropogenic climate change.

The statement is presented as historical evidence of past mild winters, supposedly undermining modern climate science.However, a detailed investigation reveals that the claim originates from a 1989 article in the Swedish newspaper Norrköpings Tidningar, which appears to have copied a 1944 text from Vestkusten, a Swedish-language newspaper in California. That earlier article referenced anecdotal weather reports—mostly from Germany, not Sweden—and cited no scientific sources. Additionally, the Swedish article falsely implied official support from SMHI by mentioning a so-called “precipitation monitor,” a title not recognized by the agency. Experts confirm that systematic weather observations in Sweden did not begin until 1722, making earlier claims unverifiable. They also emphasize that isolated weather anecdotes do not provide reliable insight into climate patterns. In contrast, decades of comprehensive global climate data show a clear warming trend driven primarily by human greenhouse gas emissions.Verdict: False. The claim is based on misrepresented, non-scientific anecdotes and does not reflect Swedish conditions or credible climate science.;1. Claim Being Evaluated: That “all the trees were completely green in February 1722” in Sweden — a claim shared widely by climate skeptics to imply that unusual weather is natural and not a result of human-driven climate change.2. Key Evidence Reviewed: - The statement originates from a 1989 article in Norrköpings Tidningar, which appears to have reproduced text from a 1944 article in Vestkusten, a Swedish-American newspaper.- The original text includes anecdotal weather descriptions, many referring to Germany, not Sweden.- The only cited source in the Swedish article, a “precipitation monitor” named Gunnar Carlberg, cannot be verified as affiliated with the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI).- Sweden’s first systematic weather measurements began in 1722 in Uppsala — making all earlier weather reports unverifiable.- Experts emphasize that isolated historical weather anecdotes cannot be used to make conclusions about climate trends.- The scientific consensus, supported by long-term data, confirms that current global warming is primarily caused by human greenhouse gas emissions, not natural fluctuations.3. Verdict: False The claim is based on unverified anecdotes, misrepresented geographical context (Germany, not Sweden), and gives a misleading impression of scientific legitimacy. It is incorrectly used to undermine established evidence that human activity is the main driver of modern climate change.;Green February Newspaper Clipping Falsely Used to Dismiss Climate Change: Fact-Check;A widely circulated newspaper clipping from 1989, featuring the headline In February 1722, all the trees were completely green, is being used on social media by climate change skeptics to suggest that unusual weather events and mild winters are historical occurrences unrelated to human-induced climate change. This claim asserts that the past existence of such events disproves or diminishes the significance of current climate change. However, an investigation into the origins and context of this article reveals a different picture. The clipping's content is largely traced back to a 1944 article in a Swedish-American newspaper discussing historical weather anomalies, including conditions in Germany. Furthermore, the purported source within the 1989 article, an SMHI precipitation monitor, appears to be inaccurate, and the listed historical anecdotes are isolated weather observations, not part of systematic climate data. Ultimately, the claim that this newspaper clipping provides evidence against human-caused climate change is false and misleading. This verdict is reached because the article is taken out of its original context, relies on dubious sourcing, incorporates information about weather in another country, and presents isolated historical anecdotes as evidence against long-term, scientifically documented climate trends caused by human activity.;Here's the breakdown to determine the verdict:1. Identify the claim being evaluated: The claim is that a 1989 newspaper article, reporting an instance of green trees in February 1722, serves as evidence against the idea that current unusual weather patterns are linked to human-caused climate change. The implication is that such events are natural and have occurred historically.2. Review the key evidence provided to assess the claim:   The 1989 article itself doesn't analyze climate change, it merely lists historical anecdotes of mild winters.   The source cited in the 1989 article (an SMHI precipitation monitor) is likely inaccurate, and the anecdotes were probably collected privately.   A significant portion of the 1989 text is traced back to a 1944 article about historical weather, including conditions in Germany, suggesting plagiarism and a lack of focus on Swedish climate.   The historical anecdotes are isolated weather observations and not part of long-term climate data necessary to draw conclusions about climate trends.   The overwhelming scientific consensus, as stated by the IPCC, confirms that human influence is unequivocally warming the climate.3. Based on this evidence, determine the verdict: The verdict is False and Misleading.  Justification: The newspaper clipping is being used to support a claim it does not actually make. The article's content is not a scientific analysis of climate, its sourcing is dubious, and it even includes information about weather in another country, misrepresented as relevant to the Swedish climate debate. Furthermore, using isolated historical weather events to contradict the vast body of scientific evidence for human-caused climate change is a misrepresentation of both the article's content and established scientific understanding. Therefore, the claim that this article disproves or weakens the case for anthropogenic climate change is demonstrably false and misleading.;Viral Claim About 1722 'Green February' is False and Misleading;A viral newspaper clipping is circulating on social media, claiming that In February 1722, all the trees were completely green.

Investigation by the Source Criticism Agency reveals the article largely describes German weather, not Swedish, derived from a 1944 Vestkusten newspaper, with references to Germany edited out. It relies on unverified anecdotes from “Gunnar Carlberg,” not affiliated with SMHI’s historical analysis, and cites years like 1172 when no weather records existed in Sweden. The claim is false, as IPCC data confirms human greenhouse gas emissions drive recent global warming, unlike isolated weather events. The clipping’s misuse ignores scientific consensus, rendering it irrelevant to modern climate change evidence.;1. Claim Being Evaluated: The claim is that a 1989 newspaper clipping from Norrköpings Tidningar, headlined “In February 1722, all the trees were completely green,” and listing historical mild winters, demonstrates that climate has always varied naturally, implying that human activity does not significantly contribute to modern climate change.2. Key Evidence Provided:  - Source Misrepresentation: The article is presented as evidence of natural climate variability in Sweden, but much of its content originates from a 1944 Vestkusten newspaper article about German weather. References to Germany were removed in the 1989 version, creating a misleading impression of Swedish conditions.  - Unreliable Sourcing: The article attributes its data to “Gunnar Carlberg,” described as an SMHI precipitation monitor. SMHI has no record of him, and the role does not involve historical weather analysis. The cited “old scrapbooks” are vague, and claims about years like 1172 predate weather measurements in Sweden, which began in 1722.  - Scientific Context: The anecdotes describe isolated weather events, not climate trends. The IPCC’s latest report confirms that human-induced greenhouse gas emissions have driven unprecedented global warming since 1970, distinct from natural weather variations. The clipping does not challenge this evidence.  - Misuse by Skeptics: Shared by climate skeptic groups like Klimatrealisterna, the clipping is used to argue against human-driven climate change, ignoring the scientific consensus that anthropogenic factors are the primary cause of recent warming.3. Verdict: False  - Justification: The claim is false because the clipping does not support the assertion that historical weather variability negates human-driven climate change. Its data is misrepresented (German, not Swedish), sourced unreliably (unverified anecdotes, no credible attribution), and scientifically irrelevant (weather snapshots, not climate trends). The IPCC’s evidence of human-driven warming, backed by long-term global data, directly contradicts the claim’s implication. The clipping’s use by skeptics to deny anthropogenic climate change is misleading and unsupported by the evidence.

Reasoning;Green Trees in 1722 Claim Debunked: Old Article Misused to Deny Climate Change - Verdict: False and Misleading;Fact-check: Climate change skeptics are sharing a 1989 newspaper clipping headlined In February 1722, all the trees were completely green to argue that unusual weather is natural and not linked to human activity. However, investigation reveals the article's content about historical mild winters largely originates from a 1944 article about German weather and relies on dubious sourcing, misrepresenting isolated anecdotes as evidence against established climate science. The verdict is False and Misleading because the clipping is taken out of context, contains inaccurate sourcing, and its anecdotal evidence does not negate the overwhelming scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change.;Here's the final verdict based on the provided fact-check:1. What is the claim being assessed? The claim being assessed is that a 1989 newspaper article, reporting that In February 1722, all the trees were completely green, provides evidence that current unusual weather events and mild winters are natural occurrences unrelated to human-caused climate change.2. What is the verdict? False and Misleading3. What reasoning or evidence supports this decision? The verdict of False and Misleading is supported by the following evidence and reasoning from the fact-check:   Misrepresentation of Content: The newspaper article itself does not analyze climate trends or argue against human-caused climate change. It merely presents isolated historical anecdotes of mild winters.   Dubious Sourcing: The alleged source within the article, an SMHI precipitation monitor, is likely inaccurate, and the historical information appears to have been collected privately, not as official climate data.   Plagiarism and Alteration: A significant portion of the 1989 article's text is nearly identical to a 1944 article from a Swedish-American newspaper that discussed historical weather, including conditions in Germany. This indicates that the 1989 article borrowed heavily and removed context, potentially to make it seem relevant to Swedish climate.   Flawed Logic: Using isolated historical weather events as evidence against long-term, scientifically documented climate change is illogical. Weather and climate are distinct, and anecdotal evidence does not negate broader climate trends.   Contradiction of Scientific Consensus: The overwhelming scientific consensus, as articulated by the IPCC, is that human activity is unequivocally warming the climate. Using this decontextualized and questionably sourced newspaper clipping to suggest otherwise directly contradicts established scientific findings.In conclusion, the newspaper clipping is being used to support a claim it does not make, relies on unreliable information, and misrepresents the nature of weather versus climate science. Therefore, its use to dismiss human-caused climate change is both false and misleading.;False Claim: 1989 Newspaper Article Proves Climate Has Always Varied, Verdict: Misleading;A viral newspaper clipping claims that In February 1722, all the trees were completely green, and is being used to cast doubt on human-caused climate change. An investigation into the article's origins reveals it likely originated from a 1944 article in Vestkusten, a Swedish-language newspaper published in California, and its content pertains to German weather conditions, not Swedish climate trends. Climate scientists emphasize that scattered weather observations do not indicate long-term climate trends, and human activities are significantly contributing to global warming. Based on this evidence, the claim is rated false because it's being used to mislead about climate change, and the article's origin and content do not support its implied claims about Swedish climate trends or refute human influence on climate change.;Based on the fact-check, here's the final verdict:The claim being assessed: A viral newspaper clipping claims that In February 1722, all the trees were completely green, and is being used to cast doubt on human-caused climate change.The verdict: False.Reasoning or evidence:The article's origin is dubious, likely adapted from a 1944 article in Vestkusten, a Swedish-language newspaper published in California.The article's content is likely about German weather conditions, not Swedish climate trends.Scattered weather observations do not indicate long-term climate trends.Human activities, mainly greenhouse gas emissions, have unequivocally warmed the climate system according to the IPCC.The claim is rated false because it's being used to mislead about climate change, and the evidence provided does not support the claim's implied assertions about Swedish climate trends or refute human influence on climate change.

Investigation reveals the article, published in Norrköpings Tidningar, is authentic but misrepresents data, with much of the text originating from a 1944 U.S. Swedish newspaper, Vestkusten, describing German weather, not Swedish. No evidence supports the historical claims before 1722, as weather measurements in Sweden began that year. The IPCC confirms human-driven greenhouse gas emissions are the primary cause of recent global warming, distinguishing it from natural weather variations. ;1. Claim Being Assessed: The claim, derived from a viral 1989 newspaper clipping shared by climate skeptics, asserts that historical mild winters in Sweden (e.g., trees greening in February 1722, no winter in 1269) demonstrate that climate variations are natural and not influenced by human activity, challenging the notion of human-driven climate change.2. Verdict: False.3. Reasoning and Evidence Supporting the Verdict:  - Misrepresentation of Data: The clipping, published in Norrköpings Tidningar (NT) in 1989, lists mild winters from 1172 onward, attributed to a Gunnar Carlberg, SMHI precipitation monitor. However, the text is largely derived from a 1944 article in Vestkusten, a U.S. Swedish newspaper, which describes weather in Germany, not Sweden. The NT article omits these geographic references, misleadingly implying Swedish conditions.  - Lack of Historical Evidence: No weather measurements existed in Sweden before 1722, when Uppsala’s weather station began recording. Claims about earlier years (e.g., 1172, 1269) lack verifiable data, as systematic weather observations were not conducted then.  - Source Credibility Issues: The NT article’s source, Gunnar Carlberg, is not documented at SMHI, and the term precipitation monitor does not imply expertise in historical climate analysis. The data likely came from unverified personal clippings, not scientific records.  - Scientific Consensus: The IPCC’s latest report confirms that human-driven greenhouse gas emissions are the primary cause of global warming since 1970, with a faster temperature rise than any 50-year period in the last 2,000 years. While natural climate variations exist, they do not account for the current warming trend.  - Context of Use: Shared by climate skeptic groups like Klimatrealisterna, the clipping is used to downplay human impact on climate. However, its anecdotal, unverified nature and focus on local weather (not climate) fail to refute long-term climate trends established by global data.The claim is false because it relies on misrepresented, unverified anecdotes about weather to challenge the well-documented role of human activity in climate change, contradicted by historical records and scientific evidence.

The newspaper clipping appears on Twitter;Least-to-most ;Claim That 'All Trees Were Green in February 1722' in Sweden Is False, Misleading Climate Skeptics;1. Verdict: False.2. Evidence: The claim comes from a 1989 Norrköpings Tidningar article, which reuses a 1944 text from Vestkusten, a Swedish-American newspaper. The text references anecdotal weather reports, many from Germany, not Sweden. The cited source, precipitation monitor Gunnar Carlberg, cannot be verified as an SMHI employee, and Sweden only began systematic weather measurements in 1722, making the earlier weather reports unverifiable. Additionally, the article misrepresents Swedish climate conditions and does not align with current climate science, which attributes modern global warming primarily to human activity.3. Claim: The claim is that all the trees were completely green in February 1722 in Sweden, often cited by climate skeptics to suggest natural climate variability, unrelated to human-induced climate change.Summary: The claim that all the trees were completely green in February 1722 in Sweden is false. The evidence shows that the statement originates from a 1989 article that recycled a 1944 text mentioning weather from Germany, not Sweden. The cited source, Gunnar Carlberg, is not a verified SMHI employee, and Sweden only started systematic weather measurements in 1722, making claims about earlier weather unverifiable. The text misrepresents Swedish weather and fails to align with current climate science, leading to the conclusion that the claim is false and misleading.;1.

Evidence: The 1989 newspaper article about green trees in 1722 borrows heavily from a 1944 article about German weather, relies on dubious sourcing (a likely non-existent SMHI precipitation monitor), and presents isolated historical weather anecdotes as evidence against human-caused climate change, contradicting scientific consensus.3. Claim: A 1989 newspaper clipping reporting green trees in February 1722 is being used by climate skeptics to argue that current unusual weather is natural and not caused by human activity.Summary: A widely shared newspaper clipping from 1989, claiming In February 1722, all the trees were completely green, is falsely used by climate skeptics to argue that current unusual weather is natural. However, the fact-check reveals that the article largely plagiarizes a 1944 piece about German weather, cites an unreliable source, and uses isolated historical anecdotes that do not negate the overwhelming scientific evidence of human-caused climate change, leading to a verdict of False and Misleading.;1. What is the claim being evaluated? The claim being evaluated is that a 1989 newspaper article, reporting green trees in February 1722, provides evidence that current unusual weather events are natural and not linked to human-caused climate change.2. Based on the evidence provided, is the claim true, false, mixed or another verdict category? False and Misleading.3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict? The 1989 article's content about historical mild winters is largely traced to a 1944 article about German weather, relies on questionable sourcing (a likely non-existent SMHI precipitation monitor), and presents isolated historical weather anecdotes as evidence against human-caused climate change, contradicting the overwhelming scientific consensus.Final Verdict: False and Misleading. The newspaper clipping is being used to support a claim it does not make, relies on unreliable and misrepresented information, and contradicts established scientific understanding of climate change.;Claim: 1989 Article Shows Sweden's Climate Has Always Varied, Verdict: False;NA;Claim Being Evaluated: A 1989 newspaper article claims that in February 1722, all trees were completely green, and similar claims are made about other years, suggesting the climate has always varied.Verdict Category: False and misleading.Evidence Supporting the Verdict:The article's origin is likely a 1944 newspaper about German weather, not Swedish conditions as implied.Lack of credible sources to support the claims about historical weather events in Sweden.Experts confirm human influence is a major factor in global warming, contrary to the article's intent.Final Verdict: The claim is false and misleading. The viral newspaper article from 1989 was likely fabricated from a 1944 article about German weather, and its claims about historical weather events in Sweden are unverified. Experts emphasize that human activities contribute significantly to climate change, contrary to the article's implication. The article's unclear origin, misrepresentation of historical weather data, and misleading narrative render the claim unreliable.;Claim of Ancient Swedish Winters Proving Natural Climate Change Debunked as False;A viral 1989 newspaper clipping claiming historical mild winters in Sweden, such as trees greening in February 1722, suggests climate variations are natural and not human-driven. Investigation reveals the article, published in Norrköpings Tidningar, misrepresents data from a 1944 U.S. Swedish newspaper, Vestkusten, which described German weather, not Swedish, with key geographic details omitted. No weather records existed in Sweden before 1722, invalidating earlier claims, and the article’s source lacks credibility. The IPCC confirms human greenhouse gas emissions drive recent global warming, distinct from natural variations. Verdict: False, as the claim relies on inaccurate, unverified anecdotes to misleadingly challenge established climate science.;1.

Verdict: False.3. Evidence and Reasoning Supporting the Verdict:- The 1989 Norrköpings Tidningar (NT) article is authentic but misrepresents data, as it originates from a 1944 Vestkusten article describing German weather, not Swedish, with geographic references removed, creating a misleading narrative.- No systematic weather measurements existed in Sweden before 1722, when Uppsala’s weather station began, rendering claims about earlier years (e.g., 1172, 1269) unverifiable and unsupported by historical records.- The NT article’s source, “Gunnar Carlberg,” is not documented at SMHI, and the term “precipitation monitor” does not imply expertise in historical climate analysis, undermining the data’s credibility.- The IPCC’s latest report establishes that human-driven greenhouse gas emissions are the primary cause of global warming since 1970, with a faster temperature rise than any 50-year period in the last 2,000 years, distinguishing human-induced climate change from natural weather variations.- The clipping’s use by climate skeptic groups to downplay human impact relies on anecdotal, unverified weather observations that do not address long-term climate trends supported by global scientific data.Final Verdict: The claim is false. The viral clipping misrepresents German weather data as Swedish, lacks verifiable historical evidence for pre-1722 claims, and is contradicted by scientific consensus from the IPCC, which confirms human-driven greenhouse gas emissions as the primary cause of recent global warming. The claim’s reliance on inaccurate anecdotes fails to challenge established climate science.

The fact-check reveals that this claim is based on an article from Norrköpings Tidningar, which cites anecdotal weather records, some of which refer to Germany rather than Sweden. Additionally, the article's only cited source, a precipitation monitor named Gunnar Carlberg, cannot be verified as affiliated with the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI). Furthermore, Sweden only began systematic weather measurements in 1722, making it impossible to verify such claims from earlier years. Based on this evidence, the claim is false and misleading.;1.

Final Verdict: False.3. Explanation: The claim is based on a 1989 article that references weather observations, many of which were from Germany rather than Sweden. The article's source, a precipitation monitor named Gunnar Carlberg, cannot be verified as affiliated with the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI). Furthermore, Sweden only began systematic weather measurements in 1722, making any claims about the climate in 1722 unverifiable. The article also does not accurately reflect Swedish climate science. Therefore, the claim is false and misleading.;Fact-Check: Old Green Trees in February Clipping Doesn't Debunk Human-Caused Climate Change;Claim: A widely circulated newspaper clipping from 1989, headlined In February 1722, all the trees were completely green, is used by climate skeptics to suggest that mild winters and early greening of trees are natural occurrences and not indicative of human-caused climate change.Evidence: The fact-check reveals that the 1989 article in Norrköpings Tidningar (NT) is likely based on an earlier article published in the Swedish-language newspaper Vestkusten in California in 1944. This earlier article, attributed to Svenska Landsbygden, includes observations of mild winters with some specifically referencing Germany. The NT article omits the German references and presents the information as potentially Swedish, citing a questionable source, a precipitation monitor for SMHI who is not known by that title at SMHI. Furthermore, historical weather measurements in Sweden only reliably began in 1722, making observations from earlier dates anecdotal. Climate science, as stated by the IPCC and SMHI, unequivocally shows that human influence is the primary driver of the current rapid global warming trend, which is distinct from isolated historical weather events.Verdict: False. The newspaper clipping does not provide evidence against human-caused climate change. It is based on a potentially misrepresented historical article, includes anecdotal observations, and even contains information about weather in Germany. It lacks the scientific rigor of long-term climate data and contradicts the overwhelming scientific consensus on anthropogenic global warming.;1. Claim: The newspaper clipping In February 1722, all the trees were completely green and the historical anecdotes it contains demonstrate that current climate change is not caused by human activity but is part of natural climate variations.2. Verdict: False.3. Explanation: The evidence shows that the newspaper article is likely based on a misattributed and edited piece that even included observations from Germany. The historical anecdotes are isolated weather events, not systematic climate data. Reliable weather measurements in Sweden only began in 1722. In contrast, the overwhelming scientific consensus, supported by the IPCC and SMHI, is that the current rapid global warming is unequivocally driven by human greenhouse gas emissions, distinct from natural weather fluctuations.

It was based on a 1944 newspaper clipping, not official meteorological records. Furthermore, Sweden’s first systematic weather measurements began in 1722, and the cited source was not an official SMHI representative. Experts affirm that isolated historical anecdotes do not refute the overwhelming scientific consensus that current global warming is primarily caused by human activity.;Green Trees in February Clipping Doesn't Debunk Human-Caused Climate Change: Fact-Check;Claim: A widely shared newspaper clipping from 1989, reporting In February 1722, all the trees were completely green, is used by climate skeptics to argue that such events are natural and disprove human-caused climate change.Evidence: The article likely originated from a 1944 publication with some observations about Germany, misrepresenting historical context and citing an unreliable source. Historical weather records in Sweden only began in 1722, making earlier claims anecdotal. Scientific consensus from the IPCC and SMHI confirms that current global warming is unequivocally driven by human emissions, unlike isolated historical weather events.Verdict: False.;1. Claim: The newspaper clipping from 1989 about trees being green in February 1722 and other historical anecdotes demonstrate that current climate change is not caused by human activity but is a natural variation.2. Verdict: False.3. Explanation: The fact-check reveals that the newspaper article is likely based on a distorted and partly inaccurate historical account, potentially originating from a newspaper in the United States that included observations from Germany. The cited historical anecdotes are isolated weather events and do not represent long-term climate trends. Furthermore, the overwhelming scientific consensus, supported by organizations like the IPCC and SMHI, confirms that the current rapid global warming is primarily caused by human greenhouse gas emissions, which is distinct from natural weather fluctuations.;Viral 1989 Article About Sweden's Mild Winters is False: Claims Lack Credible Sources and Originate from German Weather Report;A viral image of a 1989 newspaper article claims that Sweden experienced unusually mild winters in the past, including in 1722 when all the trees were completely green in February. Upon investigation, the article's content was found to have originated from a 1944 newspaper about German weather, and the claims about Swedish conditions lack credible sources. Based on this evidence, the claim is deemed false and misleading.;Claim Being Evaluated: A 1989 newspaper article claims that Sweden experienced unusually mild winters in the past, including in 1722 when all the trees were completely green in February, suggesting that the climate has always varied naturally.Verdict: FalseExplanation: The claim is deemed false because the article's content likely originated from a 1944 newspaper about German weather, and the claims about Swedish conditions lack credible sources. The investigation found that the article's source, Gunnar Carlberg, is unverified, and the text closely matches the 1944 article about German weather. This evidence suggests that the claim is based on misleading information.Réponse de Meta AI : Claim Being Evaluated: A 1989 newspaper article claims that Sweden experienced unusually mild winters in the past, including in 1722 when all the trees were completely green in February, suggesting that the climate has always varied naturally. Verdict: False Explanation: The claim is deemed false because the article's content likely originated from a 1944 newspaper about German weather, and the claims about Swedish conditions lack credible sources. The investigation found that the article's source, Gunnar Carlberg, is unverified, and the text closely matches the 1944 article about German weather. This evidence suggests that the claim is based on misleading information.;False: Newspaper Clipping Misleads on Climate Change by Claiming Historical Mild Winters Negate Human Impact;Claim: A newspaper clipping from 1989, stating that trees were green in February 1722 and citing other historical mild winters, is used by climate skeptics to argue that current climate change is not human-driven but part of natural climate variation.- Key Evidence: The article, published in Norrköpings Tidningar, lacks credible sourcing, misattributes data to SMHI, and omits that much of the information originates from a 1944 article about German weather, not Swedish conditions. IPCC reports confirm human-driven global warming, and weather records show 1863 temperatures in Skåne were milder but cooler than 2020.- Verdict: False. The clipping misrepresents historical weather data to downplay human-driven climate change, which is unequivocally supported by scientific evidence.AD34;1. Claim Being Evaluated: A 1989 newspaper clipping, citing historical mild winters (e.g., trees being green in February 1722), is used by climate skeptics to argue that current climate change is not caused by human activity but is part of natural climate variation.2. Verdict: False.3. Explanation: The claim is false because the newspaper article misrepresents historical weather data to undermine human-driven climate change. The fact-check reveals that the article, published in Norrköpings Tidningar, lacks credible sources, falsely attributes data to SMHI, and omits that much of the information comes from a 1944 article about German weather, not Swedish conditions. IPCC reports unequivocally confirm that human activities, primarily greenhouse gas emissions, have driven global warming since 1970 at an unprecedented rate. Additionally, weather records, such as those from Skåne in 1863, show milder conditions but are not comparable to modern warming trends, as 2020 temperatures were significantly warmer. The article’s misuse of anecdotal weather events to dismiss climate science is misleading and unsupported by evidence.

On social media, in alternative online media and among European politicians on the far right, there is a particular aversion to edible insects.Not only are insects, which fall under the category of novel food, called unappetizing, they are also seen in corners of the internet as part of an international elite's plan to introduce a new world order.Rikke Peters, an associate professor at UCL Business Academy and researcher into conspiracy theories, is new to the idea that edible insects have become a topic in conspiracy circles. But she is not the least bit surprised:“I see several parallels to existing conspiracy theories. The edible insects tap into a fear that an elite will impose some kind of eco-dictatorship and take away our individual food choices,” she says.But how did insects end up in cahoots with people like Bill Gates, and why are they interpreted as part of a socialist takeover of the world?Multi-faceted climate benefitInsects have attracted great interest as a food source because advocates have recognized that they contain large amounts of protein and are therefore suitable as both food and animal feed. Among the more popular edible insects are species such as the grasshopper, mealworm and cricket, and their production emits far less CO2 than the animals we normally eat. According to the National Food Institute at the Technical University of Denmark, for example, the production of cattle emits 100 times more greenhouse gases than the production of edible insects.Among those who care about climate and the environment, we find international organizations such as the UN and the World Economic Forum. The UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) praises insects for being nutritious , sustainable and cheap, and thus a tool to end hunger and help developing countries in a sustainable way. For much the same reason, the World Economic Forum also promotes eating insects .

Conspiracy theories are often fueled when the World Economic Forum holds its annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland. Photo: Fabrice Coffrini;Vanilla;Fact-Check: No, Edible Insects Are Not a Plot by Global Elites to Enforce an Eco-Dictatorship; Conspiracy theories falsely link edible insects to elite control: Edible insects, promoted by the UN and World Economic Forum for their sustainability and climate benefits, are increasingly targeted in conspiracy theories, especially by far-right voices, who claim they are part of a plot by global elites to impose a so-called eco-dictatorship and strip people of food freedom.Would you like this condensed into a tweet-sized summary as well?;Verdict: FalseExplanation:The primary claim being fact-checked is that edible insects are poisonous and carcinogenic, particularly due to the substance chitin, and that they are being secretly pushed by global elites (e.g., the World Economic Forum and the UN) as part of a conspiracy to impose a new world order or eco-dictatorship.The fact-check shows this claim is false for several reasons:No evidence of toxicity or carcinogenicity:Multiple scientific experts have confirmed that insects approved by food authorities in the EU are not poisonous or carcinogenic. The claim about chitin causing cancer is unfounded and has been debunked by researchers.Regulatory safeguards in place:Edible insects are classified as novel foods in the EU and must undergo rigorous safety assessments by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) before being approved for the market. Currently, only four specific insect types have been approved under these rules.Labeling requirements are clear:Contrary to claims that people are being tricked into eating insects, EU regulations require insect content to be clearly labeled on packaging, including using the insect’s Danish name in Denmark.Link to conspiracy theories:The association of edible insects with conspiracy theories is primarily driven by far-right figures, alternative media, and viral misinformation on social media, often linking them to The Great Reset, Agenda 21, or a global elite’s control agenda. However, these are conspiracy narratives with no factual basis.Therefore, the claim that insects are poisonous and being pushed secretly by global elites as part of a sinister plan is factually incorrect and misleading.;Claims Linking Edible Insects to a New World Order Conspiracy and Health Risks Are False;Edible insects, promoted for their sustainability and nutritional value by organizations like the UN and the World Economic Forum, have become the target of conspiracy theories, particularly among far-right groups, who falsely link them to a new world order agenda, often spreading misinformation about their safety and falsely claiming the EU is trying to hide their presence in food, despite clear labeling regulations and scientific evidence to the contrary.;The claim that the EU wants to trick the population into eating insects is False.  The fact-check paper clearly states: But contrary to what Nigel Farage said, it must be stated on the product label when foods in the EU contain insects. If there are insects in foods sold in Denmark, the Danish name of the insect must be stated. This directly refutes the idea of tricking consumers.;Edible Insects and Conspiracy Theories: A Fact-Check of Claims About the EU and World Economic Forum;The fact-check explores how edible insects have become linked to conspiracy theories about a New World Order and eco-dictatorship, fueled by organizations like the World Economic Forum promoting insects as a sustainable food source, and far-right politicians and social media users spreading misinformation about their safety and EU regulations.;Verdict: False. The claim that edible insects are part of an international elite's plan to introduce a new world order or eco-dictatorship is false. The evidence shows that the promotion of edible insects is based on their nutritional value, sustainability, and potential to help developing countries, and is subject to regulatory oversight and labeling requirements. The claim's origins in far-right sources and debunked social media posts further indicate a lack of factual basis.;Edible Insects Falsely Tied to Global Conspiracy, Safe and Sustainable, Experts Say;The claim that edible insects are part of a global elite's plan to impose an eco-dictatorship and force people to eat toxic, carcinogenic insects is false, insects like locusts and mealworms are approved as safe, sustainable novel foods by the EU, promoted by the UN and WEF for their low CO2 emissions and nutrition, but misrepresented in conspiracy theories linking them to Agenda 21 and The Great Reset, with false claims about chitin’s toxicity debunked by researchers, despite fueling far-right and anti-EU sentiments.;The fact-check paper investigates the claim that edible insects are part of a conspiracy by an international elite, particularly linked to the World Economic Forum (WEF), to impose a new world order or eco-dictatorship, often tied to theories like The Great Reset or Agenda 21. Additionally, it examines related claims, such as insects being poisonous or carcinogenic due to chitin and the idea that the EU is misleading consumers by not labeling insect-containing foods clearly.Verdict: FalseReasoning:Conspiracy Claims (Insects and a New World Order):The claim that edible insects are part of a global elite’s plan to establish a socialist dictatorship or eco-dictatorship (linked to the WEF, The Great Reset, or Agenda 21) lacks credible evidence. The paper highlights that organizations like the UN and WEF promote insects as a sustainable, nutritious, and environmentally friendly food source to address climate change and hunger, particularly in developing countries. These endorsements are based on scientific assessments, such as those from the National Food Institute at the Technical University of Denmark, which notes that insect production emits significantly less CO2 than traditional livestock.The association of insects with conspiracy theories stems from their endorsement by high-profile organizations, which are often targets of conspiracy narratives. However, there is no evidence supporting the idea that promoting insects is part of a sinister plan to control food choices or impose a dictatorship.Health Claims (Chitin and Toxicity):The claim that chitin in insect exoskeletons is poisonous or carcinogenic is explicitly debunked in the paper. Researchers consulted by TjekDet have denied these claims, confirming that insects approved by food authorities (e.g., the European Food Safety Authority) are safe for consumption. The idea that chitin is harmful appears to originate from a viral social media post, amplified by figures like Rob Schneider, but lacks scientific backing.EU Labeling and Transparency:The claim that the EU is trying to “trick” consumers into eating insects by not clearly labeling insect-containing foods is false. The paper clarifies that EU regulations require clear labeling of novel foods, including insects, with the Danish name of the insect specified on products sold in Denmark. This directly contradicts assertions, such as Nigel Farage’s, that the EU obscures insect ingredients with Latin names to confuse consumers.Cultural and Political Context:The paper notes that resistance to edible insects often comes from far-right politicians and groups, such as Matteo Salvini, Thierry Baudet, and Nigel Farage, who frame insects as an imposition by globalist entities like the EU or WEF. These criticisms are often rooted in broader anti-EU or anti-globalist sentiments rather than evidence-based objections. The paper also points out that insects have historical and cultural precedence as food in various regions (e.g., ancient Rome, Thailand, Japan), undermining the notion that they are an unnatural or forced dietary change.Conclusion:The claims surrounding edible insects being part of a global conspiracy, being toxic, or being deceptively included in food are not supported by evidence. The promotion of insects as food is driven by environmental and nutritional benefits, as supported by credible organizations like the UN’s FAO and the WEF, and is regulated transparently in the EU. Therefore, the overall verdict for the claims investigated in the paper is False.

What is the claim being verified?The claim being verified is that edible insects are poisonous and carcinogenic due to the substance chitin, and that global elites (such as the UN and World Economic Forum) are promoting insect consumption as part of a hidden agenda to impose control over the population, often framed as a conspiracy theory (e.g., The Great Reset, eco-dictatorship, etc.).2. What is the final verdict (True;Conspiracy Theories Linking Edible Insects to a New World Order and Safety Concerns Debunked;1. What is the claim being verified in this fact-check?  The fact-check verifies the claims circulating on social media and in alternative online media, particularly among far-right European politicians, that edible insects are unappetizing, part of an international elite's plan for a new world order, linked to figures like Bill Gates, and that they are poisonous and carcinogenic due to their chitin content.2. What is the main evidence used to support or refute this claim?  The main evidence used to refute these claims includes:   Expert opinions from researchers like Rikke Peters, who contextualize the claims within existing conspiracy theories about eco-dictatorship and loss of food choice.   Information from reputable organizations like the UN's FAO and the World Economic Forum highlighting the nutritional and sustainable benefits of insects as food.   Statements from researchers (referenced as denying the claims to TjekDet) refuting the assertion that EU-approved insects are poisonous or that chitin is carcinogenic.   Information on EU regulations for novel foods, which mandate risk assessment by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and clear labeling of insect-containing products.   Examples of the historical and current consumption of insects in various cultures, demonstrating they are not an entirely foreign food source.   Analysis of the origins of the misinformation, tracing it back to a viral English-language post and the far-right German media outlet Compact, amplified by figures like actor Rob Schneider and the Danish blog Danmark Vågner.;Here's the breakdown of the fact-check:What is the claim being verified?The central claim being verified is that an international elite, particularly the World Economic Forum, is attempting to force or trick the population into eating insects as part of a larger plan for an eco-dictatorship or new world order, often linked to 5G technology and COVID-19 vaccines. Specifically, a related rumor is that the EU intends to trick the population into eating insects without their knowledge.What is the final verdict?FalseWhat evidence or reasoning supports this verdict?No evidence of forced consumption: The article highlights that organizations like the UN's FAO and the World Economic Forum promote insects as a sustainable and nutritious food source for climate and hunger reasons, but there is no mention or evidence of them forcing people to eat them.EU labeling requirements: Crucially, the fact-check explicitly states: But contrary to what Nigel Farage said, it must be stated on the product label when foods in the EU contain insects. If there are insects in foods sold in Denmark, the Danish name of the insect must be stated. This directly refutes the idea of tricking consumers into eating insects.Safety assessment: Insects approved for consumption in the EU (four types are listed) undergo risk assessment by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and approval by the EU Commission, indicating a regulated process, not a clandestine one.Disproven health claims: The claim that chitin in insects is poisonous or carcinogenic is explicitly denied by researchers mentioned in the article.Conspiracy theory parallels: The article connects the anti-insect sentiment to existing conspiracy theories like Agenda 21 and The Great Reset, where global organizations are seen as tools for a socialist dictatorship, framing the insect narrative as part of a broader, unsubstantiated conspiratorial pattern.Origin of misinformation: The article traces the misinformation to specific sources like the Danmark Vågner blog, which in turn drew from an English-language viral post (shared by a conspiracy theorist) and a German far-right media outlet, demonstrating a clear path of misinformation spread rather than a hidden truth.;No, Eating Insects Won't Usher in a New World Order;The claim being verified is that edible insects are part of an international elite's plan to introduce a new world order, and that organizations like the World Economic Forum and the EU are promoting insects as food to control people's diets and impose eco-dictatorship. The main evidence used to refute this claim includes: Researcher Rikke Peters' explanation that edible insects tap into existing conspiracy theories about eco-dictatorship and loss of individual food choices. EU regulations requiring risk assessment and approval for novel foods, including insects. Facts about approved insect species for food use in the EU and labeling requirements. Origins of misinformation about insect safety being traced to viral social media posts and far-right media outlets. Expert denial of claims that approved edible insects are poisonous or carcinogenic.;Claim being verified: The claim is that edible insects are part of an international elite's plan to introduce a new world order or eco-dictatorship, with organizations like the World Economic Forum promoting insects as food as part of this plan.Final verdict: False.Evidence or reasoning:The promotion of edible insects by organizations like the World Economic Forum and the UN is based on their nutritional value, sustainability, and potential to help developing countries, not on implementing a new world order.The EU's approval process for novel foods, including insects, involves risk assessments and labeling requirements, which contradicts the claim of a secretive agenda.Researchers have denied claims that edible insects are poisonous or carcinogenic, debunking health-related assertions made in the conspiracy theory.The claim's origins in far-right sources and debunked social media posts further indicate a lack of factual basis.This evidence collectively supports the verdict that the claim is false, as it is rooted in conspiracy theories rather than factual information.;Conspiracy Claims About Toxic Insects Debunked: EU-Approved Foods Are Safe, Not Elite Plot;1. What is the claim being verified in this fact-check? The fact-check verifies the claim that edible insects are part of an international elite's conspiracy to impose a new world order or eco-dictatorship, specifically linked to theories like Agenda 21 and The Great Reset. It includes assertions that insects are toxic (due to chitin in their exoskeletons being carcinogenic) and that the EU is secretly forcing people to eat them, as promoted by organizations like the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the UN.2. What is the main evidence used to support or refute this claim? - Refuting toxicity claims: Researchers have debunked the claim that chitin in insects’ exoskeletons is carcinogenic or toxic, confirming to TjekDet that insects approved by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) are safe for consumption. Four insect types (locust, mealworm, cricket, and weevil larvae) are regulated as novel foods in the EU and deemed safe.- Context of insect promotion: The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the WEF promote insects for their high protein content, low CO2 emissions (100 times lower than cattle, per the National Food Institute at the Technical University of Denmark), and potential to combat hunger sustainably. This aligns with environmental and nutritional goals, not conspiratorial agendas.- Misinformation origins: The conspiracy stems from misinterpretations of WEF and UN endorsements, amplified by far-right figures (e.g., Matteo Salvini, Thierry Baudet, Nigel Farage) and social media, including a viral 2022 post echoed by actor Rob Schneider and the Danish blog Danmark Vågner. The blog’s claims trace to a German far-right outlet, Compact, showing a pattern of misinformation spread.- EU regulations: Contrary to claims of deception, EU rules require clear labeling of insects in food products, including their Danish names in Denmark, refuting allegations of covert inclusion.- Conspiracy theory parallels: Rikke Peters, a conspiracy theory researcher, notes that insect-related claims tap into existing narratives like Agenda 21 and The Great Reset, which falsely portray UN and WEF initiatives as tools for global control, fueling fear of lost food choice autonomy.;1. What is the claim being verified?The fact-check paper investigates several related claims about edible insects, primarily:Conspiracy Claim: Edible insects are part of an international elite’s plan, particularly linked to the World Economic Forum (WEF), to impose a new world order or eco-dictatorship, often tied to theories like The Great Reset or Agenda 21.Health Claim: Insects are poisonous or carcinogenic due to chitin in their exoskeletons.Labeling Claim: The EU is misleading consumers by not clearly labeling foods containing insects, potentially tricking people into consuming them.2. What is the final verdict?False3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict?Conspiracy Claim:Evidence: The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the WEF promote edible insects as a sustainable, nutritious, and low-carbon food source to address climate change and global hunger. The National Food Institute at the Technical University of Denmark states that insect production emits 100 times less greenhouse gas than cattle. These endorsements are based on scientific and environmental considerations, not a plot to impose a dictatorship.Reasoning: The paper notes that conspiracy theories like The Great Reset or Agenda 21 misinterpret legitimate sustainability efforts as sinister plans. The association of insects with these theories arises from their endorsement by high-profile organizations, which are frequent targets of conspiracy narratives, but no credible evidence supports the claim of a globalist agenda to control food choices.Health Claim:Evidence: Researchers consulted by TjekDet explicitly deny that chitin in insect exoskeletons is poisonous or carcinogenic. Insects approved by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) for consumption (e.g., locusts, mealworms, crickets) undergo rigorous safety assessments.Reasoning: The claim about chitin’s toxicity originated from a viral social media post amplified by figures like Rob Schneider but lacks scientific backing. Approved edible insects are deemed safe by regulatory bodies, contradicting the claim.Labeling Claim:Evidence: EU regulations for novel foods require clear labeling of insect ingredients, including the Danish name of the insect on products sold in Denmark. This is confirmed by the Danish Food and Agriculture Organization.Reasoning: Claims, such as those by Nigel Farage, that the EU uses obscure Latin names (e.g., Acheta domesticus) to hide insect content are false. Transparent labeling requirements ensure consumers are informed, debunking the notion of deception.Additional Context:The paper highlights that opposition to edible insects often comes from far-right politicians (e.g., Matteo Salvini, Thierry Baudet, Nigel Farage) and groups linked to anti-EU or anti-globalist sentiments, as well as outlets like Danmark Vågner and Compact, which spread misinformation. These sources amplify distrust but do not provide evidence for the claims.Insects have historical and cultural precedence as food (e.g., in ancient Rome, Thailand, Japan), undermining the idea that they are an unnatural or forced dietary imposition.Conclusion: The claims that edible insects are part of a conspiracy, are toxic, or are deceptively included in foods are not supported by evidence. Scientific, regulatory, and historical data confirm insects’ safety, sustainability, and transparent inclusion in food systems. Thus, the verdict is False.

Photo: Fabrice Coffrini;Chain-of-Thought; No, Edible Insects Are Not Harmful or a Tool of Global Elite Conspiracy, Experts Say;1. Claim Being Evaluated:The core claim is that edible insects are harmful to human health—specifically that they contain a substance called chitin, which is said to be indigestible and carcinogenic—and that their promotion by international organizations like the UN and the World Economic Forum is part of a broader conspiracy by global elites to impose dietary control and establish an “eco-dictatorship.”---2. Evidence Used to Assess the Claim:The fact-check refutes this claim using the following evidence: Scientific expertise: Researchers confirm that chitin is not carcinogenic and that approved insect species are safe for human consumption. Regulatory oversight: Insects classified as novel foods in the EU must undergo risk assessment by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and be approved by the EU Commission before being sold. Misinformation tracing: The false claims about chitin and elite conspiracy theories originated from unreliable sources, including viral social media posts, conspiracy blogs, and far-right media with political motives. Contextual clarification: Insects are promoted for their environmental and nutritional benefits, not as a means of coercion, and food labeling laws in the EU ensure transparency when insects are used in products;1. Identify the claim being evaluated:The central claim being evaluated is that:Edible insects are poisonous or carcinogenic (due to chitin), and their promotion by global organizations like the UN and World Economic Forum is part of a secretive plan (e.g., The Great Reset) to control or manipulate the population.2. Review the key evidence provided to assess the claim:Scientific consensus refutes toxicity claims:Multiple researchers have confirmed that the substance chitin, found in insect exoskeletons, is not carcinogenic or toxic in the forms and quantities found in approved edible insects. Claims about chitin being poisonous have been debunked.Regulation and safety approval by the EU:Insects are classified as novel foods in the EU. Before they can be sold, they must be risk-assessed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and approved by the European Commission. Four insect species are currently approved.Transparent food labeling laws:Foods containing insects must clearly indicate their presence on the product label, including the insect's common name in the relevant language (e.g., Danish).Conspiracy theories traced to fringe sources:The conspiracy theories linking edible insects to a global elite agenda are spread largely by far-right politicians, alternative media, and viral posts on social media. Sources include disinformation websites, conspiracy theorists (e.g., Rob Schneider), and extremist platforms. These theories have no factual basis.3. Determine the verdict and justify your decision:Verdict: FalseJustification:The scientific claims that insects are carcinogenic or toxic are not supported by evidence.Approved insect products in the EU are considered safe and are subject to strict regulation.The conspiracy theory connecting insect consumption to a global elite agenda is unsubstantiated and fueled by misinformation and ideological bias.Public labeling laws ensure consumers are informed—contrary to the idea of secret insect inclusion in food.Conclusion:The claim is false. It misrepresents both the scientific understanding of edible insects and the regulatory practices in place, and it relies heavily on unsupported conspiracy narratives.;New World Order Insect Conspiracy Debunked: No Poison, No Secret EU Plot;1. Identify and explain the claim being evaluated:  The core claim being evaluated is that edible insects are part of a conspiracy orchestrated by an international elite, including figures like Bill Gates and organizations like the World Economic Forum (WEF), to impose a new world order and an eco-dictatorship by forcing people to eat them. This claim often includes assertions that insects are unappetizing, poisonous due to their chitin content, and that the EU is trying to secretly introduce them into our food supply without proper labeling. Essentially, it's a multi-faceted claim linking edible insects to a sinister global agenda and raising unfounded health concerns.2. Examine the main evidence provided to assess the truthfulness of this claim:  The fact-check uses several pieces of evidence to debunk this claim:   Expert Opinion: Rikke Peters, a conspiracy theory researcher, provides context by explaining how this claim parallels existing conspiracy theories about elites controlling food choices and imposing eco-dictatorships.   Organizational Endorsements: The article highlights that organizations like the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Economic Forum (WEF) promote insects for their nutritional value, sustainability, and potential to address global hunger. This endorsement, while based on environmental and health reasons, is twisted by conspiracy theorists into evidence of their involvement in the alleged plot.   Scientific Refutation of Health Risks: The fact-check explicitly mentions that researchers have denied claims circulating online that insects approved by food authorities are poisonous or that chitin, found in their exoskeletons, is carcinogenic.   EU Regulations and Transparency: The article details the EU's novel food regulations, which require a thorough risk assessment by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and approval by the EU Commission before insects can be marketed. Crucially, it emphasizes that products containing insects in the EU must be clearly labeled with the specific name of the insect, directly contradicting the claim of a secret introduction.   Origin and Spread of Misinformation: The fact-check traces the origin of the false claims to a viral English-language post, amplified by conspiracy theorists, and to content from the far-right German media outlet Compact, which was then disseminated by the Danish blog Danmark Vågner. This highlights how the conspiracy theory is constructed and spreads through specific online channels and is linked to existing anti-EU and far-right sentiments.   Historical and Cultural Context: The article briefly mentions the historical consumption of insects in ancient Rome and their current use as food in various cultures, providing a perspective that normalizes the idea of eating insects and counters the notion that it's a bizarre, elite-driven concept.In summary, the fact-check uses expert analysis, information from reputable organizations, scientific evidence, regulatory details, and an examination of the misinformation's origins to strongly refute the claims linking edible insects to a new world order conspiracy and unfounded health risks.;Claim being evaluated: The claim being evaluated is that the EU intends to trick its population into eating insects, or that there's an international elite (like the World Economic Forum) planning to force people to consume insects as part of a new world order or eco-dictatorship.Key evidence provided:The UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Economic Forum (WEF) advocate for insects as a nutritious, sustainable, and cheap food source, citing their climate benefits and potential to address hunger.The association of insect consumption with conspiracy theories (like Agenda 21 and The Great Reset) where global organizations are seen as imposing a socialist dictatorship.Claims circulating on social media and far-right platforms that insects are poisonous due to chitin, which researchers have denied.EU regulations for novel foods require edible insects to be risk-assessed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and approved by the EU Commission before marketing.Four types of insects are currently approved for use in food in the EU: Common migratory locust, Mealworm larvae, Domestic sheep chicken, and Chicken weevil larvae.The fact-check explicitly states: But contrary to what Nigel Farage said, it must be stated on the product label when foods in the EU contain insects. If there are insects in foods sold in Denmark, the Danish name of the insect must be stated.Politicians from EU-critical parties have expressed opposition to edible insects, framing it as part of a forced agenda.The origin of some of the misinformation is traced to a viral English-language post and a German far-right media outlet.Verdict: FalseJustification:The claim that the EU or an international elite is trying to trick or force the population to eat insects is false. While organizations like the UN and WEF promote insects as a sustainable food source, there is no evidence of a coercive agenda. Crucially, EU regulations require clear labeling of products containing insects. The fact-check explicitly states, it must be stated on the product label when foods in the EU contain insects, directly refuting the idea of deception. Furthermore, claims of insects being poisonous are denied by researchers, and the narrative itself is shown to be intertwined with existing, unsubstantiated conspiracy theories and spread through far-right media. The presence of regulation and transparency in labeling contradicts the notion of a hidden agenda to trick consumers.;Claim That Edible Insects Are Part of a 'New World Order' Plan Is False;Claim being evaluated: The claim being evaluated is that edible insects are part of an international elite's plan to introduce a new world order, with organizations like the World Economic Forum and the EU promoting insects as food to control people's diets and impose eco-dictatorship. This claim asserts a sinister motive behind the promotion of insect-based food, linking it to conspiracy theories.  Main evidence: The fact-check presents several key pieces of evidence to assess the claim's truthfulness:  Researcher Rikke Peters explains that edible insects have become linked to existing conspiracy theories about eco-dictatorship and loss of individual food choices.  The EU has regulations in place for approving novel foods, including insects, which require risk assessment and approval by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).  The World Economic Forum and UN's Food and Agriculture Organization promote insects as a sustainable food source due to their nutritional value and low environmental impact.  Far-right politicians and media outlets have spread misinformation about edible insects, tracing back to viral social media posts.  Experts deny claims that approved edible insects are poisonous or carcinogenic.;Claim being evaluated: The claim is that edible insects are part of an international elite's plan to introduce a new world order or eco-dictatorship, with organizations like the World Economic Forum promoting insects as food to control people's diets.Key evidence:The World Economic Forum and the UN promote edible insects due to their nutritional value, sustainability, and potential to help developing countries.The EU has a regulatory framework for approving novel foods, including insects, which involves risk assessment and labeling requirements.Researchers have rejected claims that edible insects are poisonous or carcinogenic.The claim's origins are traced to far-right sources and debunked social media posts.Verdict: False.The evidence shows that the promotion of edible insects is based on legitimate reasons such as nutritional value and sustainability, rather than a plan for a new world order or eco-dictatorship.The regulatory framework and labeling requirements for edible insects in the EU contradict the claim of a secretive or coercive agenda.The rejection of health-related claims by researchers further undermines the basis of the conspiracy theory.The claim's origins in far-right sources and debunked social media posts indicate a lack of factual basis.Final Verdict: The claim is false due to the lack of evidence supporting a conspiracy and the presence of legitimate reasons for promoting edible insects.;Edible Insects Safe, Not a Toxic Elite Plot, Despite Conspiracy Claims;1. Identify and explain the claim being evaluated in this fact-check The core claim being evaluated is that edible insects are part of a conspiracy by a global elite to impose an eco-dictatorship or new world order, specifically tied to theories like Agenda 21 and The Great Reset. The claim asserts that insects, promoted by organizations such as the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the UN, are toxic and carcinogenic (due to chitin in their exoskeletons) and that the EU is secretly forcing people to consume them, stripping away individual food choices as part of a socialist or authoritarian agenda.2. Examine the main evidence provided to assess the truthfulness of this claim The fact-check provides several key pieces of evidence to refute the claim and demonstrate its falsehood:- Safety of edible insects: Researchers have explicitly denied to TjekDet that approved edible insects are toxic or carcinogenic, refuting claims about chitin (found in insect exoskeletons) causing cancer. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) assesses and approves novel foods, and four insect types—migratory locust, mealworm larvae, domestic cricket, and weevil larvae—are currently authorized as safe for consumption in the EU under strict regulations.- Legitimate promotion of insects: The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the WEF advocate for insects as a sustainable, protein-rich food source with significantly lower CO2 emissions than traditional livestock (e.g., cattle production emits 100 times more greenhouse gases, according to the National Food Institute at the Technical University of Denmark). The FAO highlights insects’ nutritional value and potential to address hunger in developing countries, aligning with environmental and sustainability goals, not conspiratorial motives.- Transparency in EU regulations: Contrary to claims that the EU is covertly adding insects to food, EU novel food regulations require clear labeling of insect-containing products, including the use of the insect’s Danish name in Denmark. This transparency debunks assertions of deception, as seen in statements by figures like Nigel Farage, who falsely suggested obscure Latin names hide insect content.- Origins of misinformation: The conspiracy claims trace back to a viral 2022 English-language social media post, amplified by actor Rob Schneider, and a German far-right outlet, Compact, linked to Alternative für Deutschland and Pegida. These claims were echoed in Denmark by the blog Danmark Vågner, which also spreads misinformation about 5G and COVID-19 vaccines. The pattern shows how misinformation spreads across far-right and conspiracy networks.- Conspiracy theory context: Rikke Peters, an associate professor and conspiracy theory researcher, explains that the insect narrative taps into existing theories like Agenda 21 and The Great Reset, which falsely portray UN and WEF initiatives as tools for global socialist control. The WEF’s endorsement of insects, especially during high-profile Davos meetings, is misconstrued to fuel fears of an elite-driven loss of food autonomy, despite no evidence supporting such a takeover.- Political exploitation: Far-right European politicians, including Matteo Salvini (Italy’s Lega), Thierry Baudet (Netherlands), and Nigel Farage (UK Brexit Party), have criticized edible insects to rally anti-EU sentiment, falsely linking EU insect approvals (e.g., mealworms in January 2023) to a WEF-driven agenda. Their rhetoric amplifies the conspiracy but lacks factual grounding.In summary, the claim is false. Edible insects are safe, sustainable, and transparently regulated, promoted for environmental and nutritional benefits, not as part of a global conspiracy. Misinformation stems from misinterpretations of legitimate endorsements and is spread by far-right and conspiracy networks.;1. Identify the Claim Being EvaluatedThe fact-check paper evaluates multiple related claims about edible insects, primarily:Conspiracy Claim: Edible insects are part of an international elite’s plan, particularly linked to the World Economic Forum (WEF), to impose a new world order or eco-dictatorship, often connected to conspiracy theories like The Great Reset or Agenda 21.Health Claim: Insects are poisonous or carcinogenic due to chitin in their exoskeletons.Labeling Claim: The EU is misleading consumers by not clearly labeling foods containing insects, potentially tricking people into consuming them.2. Review the Key Evidence ProvidedConspiracy Claim:The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the WEF promote edible insects as a sustainable, nutritious, and low-carbon food source to address climate change and global hunger. The National Food Institute at the Technical University of Denmark notes that insect production emits 100 times less greenhouse gas than cattle production.Conspiracy theories like The Great Reset and Agenda 21 misinterpret these sustainability efforts as part of a plan to impose a global socialist dictatorship. These theories are fueled by the involvement of high-profile organizations like the WEF, which are frequent targets of conspiracy narratives.The paper cites Rikke Peters, a researcher of conspiracy theories, who notes that the promotion of insects taps into fears of an elite imposing an eco-dictatorship, but no evidence supports the claim of a coordinated plan to control food choices.Health Claim:A viral social media post, amplified by figures like Rob Schneider, claimed that chitin in insect exoskeletons is poisonous and carcinogenic. However, researchers consulted by TjekDet explicitly deny these claims, confirming that insects approved by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) are safe for consumption.Four insect types (locust, mealworm, cricket, and buffalo worm) are approved as novel foods in the EU after rigorous risk assessments by EFSA and the EU Commission.Labeling Claim:EU regulations require clear labeling of novel foods, including insects, with the Danish name of the insect specified on products sold in Denmark, as confirmed by the Danish Food and Agriculture Organization.Claims, such as those by Nigel Farage, that the EU uses obscure Latin names (e.g., Acheta domesticus) to hide insect content are contradicted by these labeling requirements.Additional Context:Opposition to edible insects often comes from far-right politicians (e.g., Matteo Salvini, Thierry Baudet, Nigel Farage) and outlets like Danmark Vågner and Compact, which are associated with anti-EU or anti-globalist sentiments. These sources amplify misinformation but lack credible evidence.Insects have historical and cultural precedence as food in regions like ancient Rome, Thailand, and Japan, countering the narrative that they are an unnatural dietary imposition.3. Determine the Verdict and Justify the DecisionVerdict: FalseJustification:Conspiracy Claim: The assertion that edible insects are part of a global elite’s plan to impose an eco-dictatorship or new world order is unsupported by evidence. The promotion of insects by the FAO and WEF is grounded in scientific data on their nutritional and environmental benefits, such as lower CO2 emissions compared to livestock (100 times less, per the National Food Institute). Conspiracy theories like The Great Reset or Agenda 21 rely on misinterpretations of these efforts, with no credible evidence of a sinister agenda.Health Claim: The claim that chitin in insects is poisonous or carcinogenic is false. Researchers have debunked this, and insects approved for consumption in the EU undergo strict safety assessments by EFSA, ensuring they are safe for human consumption.Labeling Claim: The claim that the EU hides insect content in foods is false. EU regulations mandate clear labeling, including the use of the insect’s Danish name in Denmark, ensuring transparency and contradicting claims of deception.Additional Reasoning: The spread of these claims is linked to anti-EU and anti-globalist sentiments, often amplified by far-right figures and misinformation outlets like Danmark Vågner and Compact. The historical and cultural use of insects as food further undermines the narrative that they are an unnatural or forced imposition. All aspects of the claims lack credible evidence and are contradicted by scientific, regulatory, and historical facts.Conclusion: The claims about edible insects being part of a conspiracy, toxic, or deceptively included in foods are False, as they are not supported by the evidence provided in the fact-check paper.
FC_05;Bullet point summary;Insects are a new ingredient in the stew of conspiracy theories;Edible insects are being touted as a win for both the climate and the environment. But the insects are provoking the anger of both conspiracy theorists and far-right politicians.;Here is the fact-check paper:A new type of food is slowly creeping into the company of 5G technology and corona vaccines. On social media, in alternative online media and among European politicians on the far right, there is a particular aversion to edible insects.Not only are insects, which fall under the category of novel food, called unappetizing, they are also seen in corners of the internet as part of an international elite's plan to introduce a new world order.Rikke Peters, an associate professor at UCL Business Academy and researcher into conspiracy theories, is new to the idea that edible insects have become a topic in conspiracy circles. But she is not the least bit surprised:“I see several parallels to existing conspiracy theories. The edible insects tap into a fear that an elite will impose some kind of eco-dictatorship and take away our individual food choices,” she says.But how did insects end up in cahoots with people like Bill Gates, and why are they interpreted as part of a socialist takeover of the world?Multi-faceted climate benefitInsects have attracted great interest as a food source because advocates have recognized that they contain large amounts of protein and are therefore suitable as both food and animal feed. Among the more popular edible insects are species such as the grasshopper, mealworm and cricket, and their production emits far less CO2 than the animals we normally eat. According to the National Food Institute at the Technical University of Denmark, for example, the production of cattle emits 100 times more greenhouse gases than the production of edible insects.Among those who care about climate and the environment, we find international organizations such as the UN and the World Economic Forum. The UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) praises insects for being nutritious , sustainable and cheap, and thus a tool to end hunger and help developing countries in a sustainable way. For much the same reason, the World Economic Forum also promotes eating insects . The organization brings together world leaders and other leaders once a year for a meeting in the Swiss mountain town of Davos, where climate change is often part of the agenda.CheckedFrench President Emmanuel Macron shakes hands with World Economic Forum Chairman Klaus Schwab. Conspiracy theories are often fueled when the World Economic Forum holds its annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland. Photo: Fabrice Coffrini;Contextual;Edible Insects Are Not Harmful or Part of a Global Elite Conspiracy, Fact-Check Confirms;1. The Claim:  The fact-check evaluates the claim that edible insects are harmful to human health—specifically that they contain a toxic, cancer-causing substance called chitin—and that their promotion by global organizations like the UN and the World Economic Forum is part of a conspiracy by elites to control food choices and enforce an “eco-dictatorship.”2. The Evidence:  The claim is refuted with input from researchers and food safety authorities. Experts explain that chitin, found in insect exoskeletons, is not carcinogenic, and insects approved for consumption in the EU are safe and nutritious. These insects must undergo rigorous risk assessments by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) before being sold. The conspiracy theory is traced to unreliable sources, including far-right media and viral social media posts, often linked with other debunked theories about 5G and COVID-19 vaccines.3. Conclusion:  The claim is false. There is no credible evidence that edible insects are harmful or part of a global control agenda. Scientific assessments and regulatory oversight confirm their safety, and the conspiracy narrative lacks factual basis.;1. What is the claim being assessed?The claim being assessed is:Edible insects are poisonous and carcinogenic due to the substance chitin, and their promotion by global organizations like the UN and World Economic Forum is part of a hidden elite agenda (such as The Great Reset) to impose control over the population or force people to eat insects.2. What is the verdict?Verdict: False3. What reasoning or evidence supports this decision?Scientific consensus refutes the health claim:The claim that edible insects are poisonous or carcinogenic due to chitin is scientifically unfounded. Multiple experts and researchers confirmed to the fact-checking organization TjekDet that chitin is not dangerous in the approved insect species, and there is no evidence to support the idea that these insects cause cancer.The insects approved for human consumption in the EU have undergone rigorous safety assessments by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).Clear and transparent regulation in the EU:Edible insects are classified as novel foods and must go through a strict approval process before being marketed.Labeling is mandatory—food products containing insects must state this on the packaging, including the common name in the country’s language (e.g., Danish in Denmark). This disproves the claim that consumers are being secretly tricked into eating insects.Conspiracy claims are ideologically driven and not evidence-based:The idea that global organizations (UN, WEF) are using insects as part of a hidden authoritarian plan (e.g., The Great Reset) is a conspiracy theory without factual support.These theories are propagated primarily by far-right figures, blogs, and influencers, and are closely linked to other discredited narratives, such as those surrounding 5G and COVID-19 vaccines.Origin and spread of the misinformation:The fact-check traces the misinformation to viral posts, including a false Facebook post, a conspiratorial Danish blog (Danmark Vågner), and right-wing outlets like Germany’s Compact magazine.Researchers have directly addressed and debunked these sources.Conclusion:The claim is false. It relies on debunked health misinformation, misrepresents regulatory practices, and promotes conspiracy theories without evidence. The fact-check clearly shows that edible insects approved in the EU are safe to eat, properly labeled, and their promotion by global institutions is based on climate and sustainability goals, not a secret authoritarian agenda.;Conspiracy Theories Linking Edible Insects to New World Order and Health Risks Are Baseless;1. The Claim: The central claim is that edible insects are part of a conspiracy by a global elite, including figures like Bill Gates and the World Economic Forum (WEF), to establish a new world order by forcing people to eat them. This claim also falsely asserts that insects are poisonous due to their chitin content and that the EU is secretly adding them to food without proper labeling.2. The Evidence: The fact-check refutes these claims using several key pieces of evidence:   Expert analysis linking the claims to existing conspiracy theories about eco-dictatorship.   Information from the UN's FAO and the WEF highlighting the nutritional and sustainable benefits of insects, which is misinterpreted by conspiracy theorists.   Statements from researchers debunking the assertion that EU-approved insects are poisonous or that chitin is carcinogenic.   Details of EU novel food regulations requiring safety assessments and mandatory labeling of insect-containing products.   The tracing of the misinformation's origin to online posts and far-right media outlets.   Historical and cultural examples of insect consumption, normalizing the practice.3. Rationale for the Verdict: Based on the evidence presented, the claims are false. The fact-check demonstrates that the idea of edible insects being part of a new world order conspiracy lacks factual basis and misrepresents the motivations of organizations promoting them. Furthermore, scientific evidence contradicts the claims of insects being poisonous, and EU regulations ensure transparency through mandatory labeling, directly refuting the idea of a secret introduction into the food supply.;What is the claim being assessed?The claim being assessed is that an international elite, specifically through organizations like the World Economic Forum, is orchestrating a plan to force or trick populations into eating insects as part of a new world order or eco-dictatorship, often with ties to other conspiracy theories like those surrounding 5G and COVID-19 vaccines. A related, specific rumor is that the EU is attempting to deceive its citizens into consuming insects by not clearly labeling them in food products.What is the verdict?FalseWhat reasoning or evidence supports this decision?The fact-check paper provides several points of evidence that clearly refute the claim:Transparency in EU Labeling: The most direct refutation of the trickery aspect is the explicit statement: But contrary to what Nigel Farage said, it must be stated on the product label when foods in the EU contain insects. If there are insects in foods sold in Denmark, the Danish name of the insect must be stated. This ensures consumers are aware if insect ingredients are present. Further search results confirm strict EU labeling requirements for novel foods, including insects, specifying Latin and common names, and allergen warnings.Voluntary Adoption, Not Coercion: While organizations like the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Economic Forum (WEF) do promote insects as a sustainable and nutritious food source, their advocacy is framed around addressing climate change and food security, not forcing consumption. The article and further search results indicate that insects are presented as an alternative protein source, and it's ultimately up to consumers to decide if they want to eat them. There's no evidence of a globalist plot to covertly force an insect-based diet.Debunked Health Claims: The claim that chitin in insects is poisonous or carcinogenic is explicitly dismissed by researchers. The article states, However, a number of researchers have denied to TjekDet that insects approved by food authorities are poisonous. Search results reinforce that chitin is not toxic and may even have health benefits, with any potential allergic reactions being clearly distinct from general toxicity.Connection to Existing Conspiracy Theories: The fact-check highlights that the idea of forced insect consumption taps into a fear that an elite will impose some kind of eco-dictatorship and parallels existing conspiracy theories such as Agenda 21 and The Great Reset, which are themselves unsubstantiated. This indicates that the insect narrative is an extension of pre-existing conspiratorial thinking rather than a revelation of a genuine plot.Regulatory Approval: Edible insects are categorized as novel food in the EU and undergo a rigorous risk assessment by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and approval by the EU Commission before they can be marketed. This regulatory process ensures safety and transparency, contradicting any notion of a secret or forced introduction.;No Evidence Edible Insects Are Part of a 'New World Order' Plan;The claim being assessed is that edible insects are part of a sinister plan by international elites, such as the World Economic Forum, to impose a new world order or eco-dictatorship by forcing people to eat insects. The Evidence: The main evidence includes: Expert insights from researcher Rikke Peters on the link between edible insects and conspiracy theories. EU regulations and approvals for edible insects as novel foods. Promotion of insect-based food by organizations like the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Economic Forum due to its nutritional benefits and sustainability. Misinformation tracing back to viral social media posts and far-right media outlets. Expert denial of health risks associated with approved edible insects. Rationale: The evidence suggests that the promotion of edible insects is driven by their potential to provide sustainable nutrition, and there is no credible evidence to support the claim of a sinister plan. The EU's regulatory framework ensures the safety of approved insect-based foods, and misinformation has been spread through social media and far-right outlets.;The claim being assessed is that edible insects are part of an international elite's plan to introduce a new world order or eco-dictatorship, often linking it to organizations like the World Economic Forum promoting insects as food.False.The evidence supporting this verdict includes the fact that organizations like the World Economic Forum and the UN promote edible insects due to their nutritional value, sustainability, and potential to help developing countries. Additionally, researchers have rejected claims that edible insects are poisonous or carcinogenic, and the EU has a regulatory framework for approving novel foods, including insects, which requires labeling and risk assessment. The claim's origins in far-right sources and debunked social media posts further indicate that it is based on conspiracy theories rather than factual evidence.Final Verdict: The claim is false because it is rooted in conspiracy theories and lacks factual basis, as the promotion of edible insects is driven by their environmental and nutritional benefits, and subject to regulatory oversight.;Debunking Conspiracy Theories: Edible Insects Are Not a Plot for a New World Order;1. The Claim: The fact-check assesses the claim that edible insects are part of a global elite’s conspiracy to enforce an eco-dictatorship or new world order, linked to theories like Agenda 21 and The Great Reset. It asserts that insects, endorsed by the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the UN, are toxic and carcinogenic (due to chitin in their exoskeletons) and that the EU is secretly forcing people to consume them, undermining individual food choices as part of a socialist agenda.2. The Evidence: - Safety of insects: Researchers have refuted claims to TjekDet that chitin is toxic or carcinogenic, confirming that EU-approved insects (locust, mealworm, cricket, weevil larvae) are safe, as assessed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).- Legitimate promotion: The UN’s FAO and WEF promote insects for their high protein and low CO2 emissions (100 times lower than cattle, per the National Food Institute at the Technical University of Denmark), aiming to address hunger and sustainability, not to enforce control.- EU transparency: EU regulations mandate clear labeling of insect-containing foods, including Danish names in Denmark, debunking claims of covert inclusion.- Misinformation sources: The claim stems from a 2022 viral post, amplified by actor Rob Schneider and the German far-right outlet Compact, and echoed by the Danish blog Danmark Vågner. Far-right politicians like Matteo Salvini, Thierry Baudet, and Nigel Farage exploit the narrative to fuel anti-EU sentiment.- Conspiracy context: Researcher Rikke Peters notes that insect fears tap into existing conspiracy theories about global control, misinterpreting WEF and UN endorsements as evidence of an elite agenda, despite no supporting evidence.The claim is false, as insects are safe, sustainably promoted, and transparently regulated, with misinformation driven by conspiracy networks and far-right rhetoric.;1. What is the Claim Being Assessed?The fact-check paper evaluates several interconnected claims about edible insects, primarily:Conspiracy Claim: Edible insects are part of an international elite’s plan, particularly associated with the World Economic Forum (WEF), to impose a new world order or eco-dictatorship, often linked to conspiracy theories such as The Great Reset or Agenda 21.Health Claim: Insects are poisonous or carcinogenic due to the presence of chitin in their exoskeletons.Labeling Claim: The EU is misleading consumers by not clearly labeling foods containing insects, potentially tricking people into consuming them.2. What is the Verdict?False3. What Reasoning or Evidence Supports This Decision?The verdict is based on a thorough review of the evidence presented in the fact-check paper, which systematically debunks each claim with credible sources and reasoning:Conspiracy Claim:Evidence: The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the WEF promote edible insects as a sustainable, nutritious, and environmentally friendly food source to address global challenges like climate change and hunger. The National Food Institute at the Technical University of Denmark states that insect production emits 100 times less greenhouse gas than cattle production, supporting the environmental rationale for their promotion.Reasoning: Conspiracy theories like The Great Reset and Agenda 21 misrepresent these sustainability efforts as a plot to impose a global socialist dictatorship. Rikke Peters, an associate professor and conspiracy theory researcher, explains that the promotion of insects taps into fears of an elite-driven eco-dictatorship, but there is no evidence to support the claim of a coordinated plan to control food choices. The association of insects with these theories stems from their endorsement by high-profile organizations, which are frequent targets of conspiracy narratives, but this is speculative and lacks substantiation.Health Claim:Evidence: A viral social media post, amplified by figures like Rob Schneider, claimed that chitin in insect exoskeletons is poisonous and carcinogenic. However, researchers consulted by TjekDet explicitly refute this, confirming that insects approved by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) are safe for consumption. Four insect types (migratory locust, mealworm larvae, domestic cricket, and buffalo worm larvae) are approved as novel foods in the EU after rigorous risk assessments by EFSA and the EU Commission.Reasoning: The claim about chitin’s toxicity is baseless and contradicted by scientific evidence. The safety of approved edible insects is ensured through strict regulatory processes, debunking the notion that they pose health risks.Labeling Claim:Evidence: EU regulations for novel foods require clear labeling of insect ingredients, with the Danish name of the insect specified on products sold in Denmark, as confirmed by the Danish Food and Agriculture Organization. This directly contradicts claims, such as those by Nigel Farage, that the EU uses obscure Latin names (e.g., Acheta domesticus) to conceal insect content.Reasoning: The requirement for transparent labeling ensures consumers are informed about insect ingredients, refuting the idea that the EU is deceiving the public. This regulatory framework undermines the narrative of a covert effort to force insects into diets.Additional Context:The paper notes that opposition to edible insects is often driven by far-right politicians (e.g., Matteo Salvini, Thierry Baudet, Nigel Farage) and misinformation outlets like Danmark Vågner and Compact, which are linked to anti-EU and anti-globalist sentiments. These sources amplify distrust but provide no credible evidence to support the claims.Insects have a historical and cultural precedent as food in various regions (e.g., ancient Rome, Thailand, Japan), countering the narrative that they are an unnatural or imposed dietary change. For example, deep-fried insects are sold as snacks in Thai markets, and grasshoppers are used in Japanese cuisine.Conclusion: The claims that edible insects are part of a global conspiracy, are toxic due to chitin, or are deceptively included in foods are not supported by the evidence. The promotion of insects is grounded in scientific data on their environmental and nutritional benefits, their safety is ensured by rigorous EU regulations, and transparent labeling requirements prevent consumer deception. Therefore, the overall verdict for the claims assessed in the fact-check is False.

Photo: Fabrice Coffrini;Least-to-most ;Edible Insects Are Safe, Not Part of a Global Conspiracy;The claim that edible insects are harmful and part of a global elite conspiracy is false. This assertion, popularized by conspiracy theorists and far-right media, alleges that insects contain carcinogenic chitin and are promoted by organizations like the UN and the World Economic Forum as part of a plan to control global diets. However, scientific experts and food safety authorities confirm that the insects approved for human consumption in the EU are safe and nutritious. The substance chitin has not been shown to be harmful, and all approved insect-based foods undergo strict safety assessments by the EFSA. Thus, the evidence clearly refutes both the health and conspiracy aspects of the claim.;1. What is the claim being evaluated?That edible insects are poisonous and carcinogenic (due to chitin) and that global elites (e.g., the UN and World Economic Forum) are promoting them as part of a secret plan to control or manipulate the population, such as through an eco-dictatorship or The Great Reset.2. Based on the evidence provided, is the claim true, false, mixed or another verdict category?False3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict?Scientific experts reject the claim that insects or chitin are poisonous or carcinogenic. Approved edible insects are considered safe for human consumption.EU regulations require that insects be evaluated and approved by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and that products be clearly labeled.The idea of a global conspiracy is not supported by facts and is traced to conspiracy theorists, far-right influencers, and misinformation sources, not legitimate evidence.Final Verdict:False — The claim that edible insects are poisonous and part of a secret elite agenda is not supported by scientific evidence or regulatory facts. It is based on conspiracy theories and misinformation.; New World Order Conspiracy Linking Edible Insects to Poison and Secret EU Plot Is False;Evidence: Expert opinions linking the claims to existing conspiracy theories, information from the UN and WEF on the benefits of insects, scientific refutation of health risks, details of EU regulations requiring safety assessments and labeling, and the tracing of misinformation to online and far-right sources.3. Claim: Edible insects are part of a new world order conspiracy by elites to control food, are poisonous, and are being secretly added to food by the EU.Now, combining these into a cohesive summary:This fact-check investigates the claim that edible insects are part of a new world order conspiracy orchestrated by elites like the WEF and Bill Gates to control the food supply. This claim also falsely asserts that insects are poisonous and that the EU is secretly incorporating them into food without proper labeling. The evidence presented to refute this includes expert analysis connecting the claims to broader conspiracy narratives, information from organizations like the UN and WEF highlighting the sustainability and nutritional value of insects, scientific evidence debunking health risk claims, and details of EU regulations that mandate rigorous safety assessments and clear labeling of insect-containing products. Furthermore, the fact-check traces the origins of the misinformation to specific online sources and far-right media. Based on this evidence, the claim that edible insects are tied to a new world order conspiracy and pose undisclosed health risks is false.;What is the claim being evaluated?The claim being evaluated is that an international elite (e.g., the World Economic Forum) is planning to force or trick the population into eating insects as part of a new world order or eco-dictatorship, and that the EU is facilitating this by not requiring clear labeling of insect ingredients in food.Based on the evidence provided, is the claim true, false, mixed or another verdict category?FalseWhat evidence or reasoning supports this verdict?The fact-check and additional search results unequivocally refute the core tenets of the claim.No Forced Consumption: While international organizations like the UN FAO and the World Economic Forum advocate for edible insects as a sustainable and protein-rich food source to address global challenges like climate change and food security, they promote them as an option, not a mandatory diet. There is no evidence presented of any plan to force people to eat insects.Mandatory and Clear Labeling: The assertion that the EU wants to trick people into eating insects is directly contradicted by EU regulations. The fact-check explicitly states, it must be stated on the product label when foods in the EU contain insects. If there are insects in foods sold in Denmark, the Danish name of the insect must be stated. This is further supported by search results indicating that EU law (e.g., EU regulation 2025;No Evidence Edible Insects Are Part of a 'New World Order' Plan;Evidence: The key pieces of evidence include: EU regulations and approvals for edible insects as novel foods. Promotion of insect-based food by organizations like the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Economic Forum due to its nutritional benefits and sustainability. Expert denial of health risks associated with approved edible insects. Tracing of misinformation to viral social media posts and far-right media outlets. Claim: The main statement being fact-checked is that edible insects are part of a sinister plan by international elites, including the World Economic Forum and the EU, to impose a new world order or eco-dictatorship by forcing people to eat insects. Summary: The claim that edible insects are part of a sinister plan by international elites to impose a new world order or eco-dictatorship is false. The evidence shows that the EU has a regulatory framework in place to ensure the safety of approved insect-based foods, and organizations like the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Economic Forum promote edible insects due to their nutritional benefits and sustainability. Experts also deny health risks associated with approved edible insects. In contrast, misinformation about edible insects has been spread through viral social media posts and far-right media outlets. Given the lack of credible evidence supporting the claim and the rational explanations for promoting edible insects, the claim is deemed false.;The claim being evaluated is that edible insects are part of an international elite's plan to introduce a new world order or eco-dictatorship by forcing people to eat insects, often linking it to organizations like the World Economic Forum.False.The evidence supporting this verdict includes:The World Economic Forum and UN promote edible insects due to their nutritional value, sustainability, and potential to help developing countries, not as part of a plan for a new world order.EU-approved insects undergo risk assessments and must be labeled on product packaging, contradicting claims of a secretive or coercive agenda.Researchers have denied claims that edible insects are poisonous or carcinogenic.The claim's origins are traced to far-right sources and debunked social media posts, indicating a basis in conspiracy theories rather than factual evidence.Final Verdict: The claim is false. The evidence shows that the promotion of edible insects is based on their nutritional and environmental benefits, and the claim's assertions about a new world order or eco-dictatorship are rooted in conspiracy theories rather than factual evidence.;Fact-Check: No, Edible Insects Aren’t a Globalist Plot to Control Your Diet;The fact-check investigates the claim that edible insects are part of a conspiracy by global elites, associated with the WEF and UN, to enforce a new world order or eco-dictatorship. Evidence shows that insects are promoted by the FAO and WEF for their nutritional and environmental benefits, with significantly lower CO2 emissions than traditional livestock. Social media posts and blogs, like Danmark Vågner, fuel conspiracies by falsely claiming insects are poisonous, but researchers confirm the safety of approved insects, and EU regulations ensure transparent labeling. Far-right politicians amplify these narratives, misrepresenting EU policies. The fact-check concludes that the conspiracy is baseless, as insect promotion is driven by sustainability goals, not a globalist plot, and safety and transparency are upheld by regulatory bodies.;1. What is the Claim Being Evaluated?The fact-check paper evaluates three primary claims about edible insects:Conspiracy Claim: Edible insects are part of an international elite’s plan, particularly linked to the World Economic Forum (WEF), to impose a new world order or eco-dictatorship, often tied to conspiracy theories like The Great Reset or Agenda 21.Health Claim: Insects are poisonous or carcinogenic due to the chitin in their exoskeletons.Labeling Claim: The EU is misleading consumers by not clearly labeling foods containing insects, potentially tricking people into consuming them.2. Based on the Evidence Provided, Is the Claim True, False, Mixed, or Another Verdict Category?False3. What Evidence or Reasoning Supports This Verdict?Conspiracy Claim: The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and WEF promote insects as a sustainable, nutritious, and low-carbon food source, with insect production emitting 100 times less greenhouse gas than cattle, per the National Food Institute at the Technical University of Denmark. Conspiracy theories like The Great Reset or Agenda 21 misinterpret these sustainability efforts as a sinister plot to control food choices, but no evidence supports this. Rikke Peters notes that such claims tap into fears of an elite-driven eco-dictatorship, but they lack substantiation.Health Claim: Claims that chitin in insect exoskeletons is poisonous or carcinogenic, amplified by figures like Rob Schneider, are refuted by researchers consulted by TjekDet. Insects approved by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), such as locusts and mealworms, undergo rigorous safety assessments, confirming their safety for consumption.Labeling Claim: EU regulations require clear labeling of insect ingredients, including the Danish name of the insect on products sold in Denmark, as per the Danish Food and Agriculture Organization. This contradicts assertions, like those by Nigel Farage, that the EU hides insect content with obscure Latin names, ensuring consumer transparency.Additional Context: Opposition often stems from far-right politicians (e.g., Matteo Salvini, Thierry Baudet) and misinformation outlets like Danmark Vågner and Compact, which lack credible evidence. Insects have historical and cultural precedent as food (e.g., in ancient Rome, Thailand), undermining claims of unnatural imposition.Final Verdict: FalseThe claims that edible insects are part of a global conspiracy, are toxic due to chitin, or are deceptively included in foods are false. Scientific evidence supports insects’ nutritional and environmental benefits, EU regulations ensure safety and transparent labeling, and no credible evidence backs conspiracy narratives. The opposition is largely driven by misinformation and anti-globalist sentiments, not facts.
FC_05;Bullet point summary;Insects are a new ingredient in the stew of conspiracy theories;Edible insects are being touted as a win for both the climate and the environment. But the insects are provoking the anger of both conspiracy theorists and far-right politicians.;Here is the fact-check paper:A new type of food is slowly creeping into the company of 5G technology and corona vaccines. On social media, in alternative online media and among European politicians on the far right, there is a particular aversion to edible insects.Not only are insects, which fall under the category of novel food, called unappetizing, they are also seen in corners of the internet as part of an international elite's plan to introduce a new world order.Rikke Peters, an associate professor at UCL Business Academy and researcher into conspiracy theories, is new to the idea that edible insects have become a topic in conspiracy circles. But she is not the least bit surprised:“I see several parallels to existing conspiracy theories. The edible insects tap into a fear that an elite will impose some kind of eco-dictatorship and take away our individual food choices,” she says.But how did insects end up in cahoots with people like Bill Gates, and why are they interpreted as part of a socialist takeover of the world?Multi-faceted climate benefitInsects have attracted great interest as a food source because advocates have recognized that they contain large amounts of protein and are therefore suitable as both food and animal feed. Among the more popular edible insects are species such as the grasshopper, mealworm and cricket, and their production emits far less CO2 than the animals we normally eat. According to the National Food Institute at the Technical University of Denmark, for example, the production of cattle emits 100 times more greenhouse gases than the production of edible insects.Among those who care about climate and the environment, we find international organizations such as the UN and the World Economic Forum. The UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) praises insects for being nutritious , sustainable and cheap, and thus a tool to end hunger and help developing countries in a sustainable way. For much the same reason, the World Economic Forum also promotes eating insects . The organization brings together world leaders and other leaders once a year for a meeting in the Swiss mountain town of Davos, where climate change is often part of the agenda.CheckedFrench President Emmanuel Macron shakes hands with World Economic Forum Chairman Klaus Schwab. Conspiracy theories are often fueled when the World Economic Forum holds its annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland. Photo: Fabrice Coffrini;Role;Edible Insects Are Safe to Eat and Not Part of a Global Elite Conspiracy;Claim:The claim being evaluated is that edible insects are harmful to human health (specifically because chitin, a substance in their exoskeletons, is carcinogenic) and are part of a global elite conspiracy to control diets, promoted by organizations like the UN and the World Economic Forum.Evidence: Experts from food safety authorities confirm that edible insects approved in the EU are safe for human consumption and contain no harmful substances. The claim that chitin is carcinogenic is debunked by scientific research, which shows no evidence that it poses a health risk. Insects approved for consumption must go through safety assessments by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). The conspiracy theory is primarily spread by unreliable sources, including far-right media and social media posts, with no credible scientific support.Conclusion:The claim is false. The evidence shows that edible insects are safe to eat, and the conspiracy theory about global elites controlling diets through insect consumption is based on misinformation with no factual basis.;1. What is the claim being assessed?That edible insects are poisonous and carcinogenic due to the substance chitin, and that their promotion by organizations like the UN and World Economic Forum is part of a global elite conspiracy to control the population (e.g., through The Great Reset or an eco-dictatorship).2. What is the final verdict?False3. Explain how the evidence supports the verdict in a clear and concise manner:Health claims debunked: Scientific experts cited in the fact-check clearly reject the idea that edible insects are poisonous or carcinogenic. The substance chitin found in insect exoskeletons has not been shown to be harmful in the approved species and forms used in food.Strict safety regulation: Edible insects in the EU are classified as novel foods, which undergo rigorous safety evaluations by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) before approval. Only four insect species are currently approved, all after meeting safety standards.Transparent labeling laws: Contrary to claims that insect ingredients are being hidden, EU law requires clear labeling of insect content on food products, including names in local languages (e.g., Danish).Conspiracy theory origins: The claim connects insects to conspiracy narratives like The Great Reset, which are widely discredited and lack credible evidence. The misinformation stems from far-right political actors, fringe media, and viral social media posts.Final Verdict:False — The claim that edible insects are dangerous and part of a secret elite agenda is not supported by science or policy evidence and stems from conspiracy-driven misinformation.;Conspiracy Theory Linking Edible Insects to New World Order and Health Risks Debunked;1. The Claim: The fact-check evaluated the assertion that edible insects are part of a conspiracy by global elites, including figures like Bill Gates and the World Economic Forum (WEF), to establish a new world order by forcing people to eat them. This claim also included false statements about insects being poisonous and the EU secretly adding them to food without proper labeling.2. Summary of the Evidence: The fact-check used several key pieces of evidence to debunk this claim. It cited expert analysis explaining how this narrative mirrors existing conspiracy theories. It highlighted that organizations like the UN and WEF promote insects for their nutritional and environmental benefits, not as part of a sinister plot. Crucially, it presented scientific information refuting the claims of insects being poisonous and detailed EU regulations that mandate rigorous safety assessments and clear labeling of any food containing insects. The fact-check also traced the spread of this misinformation to specific online sources and far-right media outlets.Based on this evidence, the fact-check concluded that the claims linking edible insects to a new world order conspiracy and health risks are false. The promotion of insects is based on sustainability and nutritional science, not a hidden agenda, and EU regulations ensure transparency and safety. The fears and misinformation circulating online are not supported by factual evidence.;1. What is the claim being assessed?The claim being assessed is that an international elite, primarily represented by the World Economic Forum, is covertly planning to force or trick the global population into eating insects as a part of a new world order or eco-dictatorship. This claim often includes the specific assertion that the European Union (EU) is facilitating this by allowing insects in food products without proper labeling.2. What is the final verdict (true, false, mixed, another relevant verdict category)?False3. Explain how the evidence supports the verdict in a clear and concise manner.The evidence overwhelmingly refutes the claim of a forced or deceitful introduction of insects into the human diet.Firstly, while the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) do promote edible insects, it is in the context of sustainable food solutions for climate change and food security, presented as a voluntary option for an alternative protein source, not a mandatory imposition. The WEF's articles on the topic are often opinion pieces and do not reflect a coercive agenda.Secondly, the central assertion about the EU's alleged deception regarding labeling is directly contradicted by the provided facts. The EU has strict novel food regulations, requiring that any food containing insects be clearly and explicitly stated on the product label, including both the Latin and common names of the insect, and often an allergen warning. This transparency empowers consumers to make informed choices, directly disproving the idea of trickery.Thirdly, the health claims that insects are poisonous or that chitin (a substance in insect exoskeletons) is carcinogenic are false. Researchers cited in the fact-check explicitly deny these claims, and further information indicates chitin is not toxic to humans and can even offer health benefits as a dietary fiber, although it can cause allergic reactions in some individuals (which is why allergen labeling is mandated).Finally, the fact-check contextualizes this claim within broader conspiracy theories like The Great Reset and Agenda 21, where global organizations are falsely depicted as aiming for a socialist dictatorship. This highlights that the forced insect eating narrative is an extension of pre-existing, unsubstantiated conspiratorial beliefs, rather than being based on factual evidence or genuine plans.;Claim That Edible Insects Are Part of 'New World Order' Plan Is False;Claim: The claim being evaluated is that edible insects are part of a sinister plan by international elites, including the World Economic Forum and the EU, to impose a new world order or eco-dictatorship by forcing people to eat insects. Evidence: The fact-check provides several key pieces of evidence to dispute the claim, including: EU regulations and approvals for edible insects as novel foods, which ensure their safety for consumption. Promotion of insect-based food by organizations like the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Economic Forum due to its nutritional benefits and sustainability. Expert denial of health risks associated with approved edible insects. Tracing of misinformation about edible insects to viral social media posts and far-right media outlets. The evidence shows that the promotion of edible insects is driven by their potential to provide sustainable nutrition, and there is no credible evidence to support the claim of a sinister plan. The EU's regulatory framework and expert opinions confirm the safety of approved edible insects, while misinformation has been spread through social media and far-right outlets. Therefore, the claim is deemed false.;The claim being assessed is that edible insects are part of a plan by international organizations like the World Economic Forum to impose a new world order or eco-dictatorship by forcing people to eat insects.False.The evidence supports the verdict of false because it shows that the promotion of edible insects by organizations like the World Economic Forum and the UN is based on their nutritional value, sustainability, and potential to help developing countries. The EU's approval process for novel foods, including insects, involves risk assessments, and products containing insects must be labeled. The claim's assertions about poisoning and cancer are also contradicted by researchers. The fact-check traces the claim's origins to far-right sources and debunked social media posts, indicating that the claim is rooted in conspiracy theories rather than factual evidence.;Fact-Check: Edible Insects Are Not a Conspiracy for a New World Order;Claim: The fact-check evaluates the assertion that edible insects are part of a conspiracy by an international elite, tied to the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the UN, to establish a new world order or eco-dictatorship, forcing people to eat insects as part of a socialist agenda.Evidence Summary: The fact-check provides several key pieces of evidence to refute the claim. First, the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the WEF promote edible insects because they are nutritious, sustainable, and emit significantly less CO2 than traditional livestock, such as cattle, which produce 100 times more greenhouse gases. Second, social media posts and blogs, like Danmark Vågner, falsely claim that insect chitin is carcinogenic and poisonous, but researchers have confirmed to TjekDet that insects approved by food authorities are safe. Third, the EU regulates edible insects as novel foods, with four types approved after rigorous safety assessments by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), and requires clear labeling of insect content, debunking claims of deception. Finally, while far-right politicians like Matteo Salvini, Thierry Baudet, and Nigel Farage link insects to EU or WEF agendas, their assertions, such as Farage’s claim of hidden insect content, are inaccurate and misrepresent regulatory transparency.Conclusion: The evidence clearly disputes the conspiracy claim. The promotion of edible insects by the UN and WEF is driven by environmental and nutritional benefits, not a plot for global control. Safety is ensured through strict EU regulations, and transparent labeling counters deception allegations. The fact-check concludes that the idea of insects as part of a new world order is baseless, rooted in misinterpretations and amplified by conspiracy theories and political rhetoric.;1. What is the Claim Being Assessed?The fact-check paper evaluates three main claims about edible insects:Conspiracy Claim: Edible insects are part of an international elite’s plan, particularly linked to the World Economic Forum (WEF), to impose a new world order or eco-dictatorship, often connected to conspiracy theories like The Great Reset or Agenda 21.Health Claim: Insects are poisonous or carcinogenic due to chitin in their exoskeletons.Labeling Claim: The EU is misleading consumers by not clearly labeling foods containing insects, potentially tricking them into consuming insects.2. What is the Final Verdict?False3. Explain How the Evidence Supports the VerdictConspiracy Claim: The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and WEF promote insects as a sustainable, nutritious food source, supported by evidence from the National Food Institute at the Technical University of Denmark, which shows insect production emits 100 times less greenhouse gas than cattle. Conspiracy theories like The Great Reset or Agenda 21 lack evidence and misinterpret these sustainability efforts as a plot to control diets, as noted by researcher Rikke Peters.Health Claim: Claims that chitin in insects is toxic or carcinogenic, spread via social media by figures like Rob Schneider, are debunked by researchers consulted by TjekDet.

Is the claim true, false, or mixed or other relevant category of verdict?False3. Provide a brief explanation for your decision based on the evidence presented in the fact-check:The claim is scientifically inaccurate—experts confirm that insects approved for human consumption are not poisonous or carcinogenic, and chitin is not harmful in the forms consumed. The insects undergo strict EU food safety approval, and their presence in food must be clearly labeled. The conspiracy narrative is rooted in misinformation from far-right and fringe sources, with no credible evidence supporting it.Final Verdict: False;New World Order Insect Conspiracy – No Poison, No Secret EU Plot;This fact-check investigates the claim that edible insects are part of a new world order conspiracy promoted by elites and organizations like the World Economic Forum (WEF) to control the food supply, and that these insects are poisonous and secretly being added to food in the EU. The evidence used to debunk this claim includes expert analysis linking it to existing conspiracy theories, information from the UN and WEF highlighting the nutritional and sustainable benefits of insects (misinterpreted by conspiracy theorists), scientific evidence refuting claims of insects being poisonous, and details of EU regulations requiring safety assessments and clear labeling of insect-containing products. The fact-check also traces the spread of this misinformation to specific online sources and far-right media. In summary, the claim is false, as the promotion of edible insects is based on scientific and environmental reasons, not a conspiracy, and EU regulations ensure transparency and safety.;What is the claim being evaluated?The claim being evaluated is that an international elite, particularly associated with the World Economic Forum, is implementing a hidden agenda to force or trick the population into eating insects as part of a new world order or eco-dictatorship, and that the EU is conspiring in this by allowing insects in food without clear labeling.Is the claim true, false, or mixed or other relevant category of verdict?FalseProvide a brief explanation for your decision based on the evidence presented in the fact-check.The claim is false because the evidence provided clearly contradicts it.Transparency, not trickery: The fact-check explicitly states that EU regulations mandate clear labeling of any food products containing insects. Consumers are informed, not tricked.Promotion, not force: While organizations like the UN and World Economic Forum advocate for insects as a sustainable and nutritious food source, this is framed as a potential solution to global challenges (like climate change and food security), not a forced imposition. Their articles and initiatives present insects as an option for an alternative protein source.Debunked health claims: The assertion that insects (specifically chitin) are poisonous or carcinogenic is denied by researchers. Scientific consensus indicates that chitin is not harmful and may even have health benefits, although allergies are a consideration and are addressed by labeling requirements.Conspiracy theory roots: The narrative itself is shown to parallel existing, unsubstantiated conspiracy theories (like Agenda 21 and The Great Reset), suggesting it stems from a broader pattern of misinformation rather than factual evidence.Regulatory approval: Edible insects must undergo a rigorous risk assessment and approval process by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the EU Commission before being marketed, further indicating a regulated and transparent process, not a secret plot.;No Evidence Edible Insects Are Part of 'New World Order' Plot;The fact-check evaluates the claim that edible insects are part of a sinister plan by international elites, including the World Economic Forum and the EU, to impose a new world order or eco-dictatorship. The key evidence used to assess the claim includes: The EU's regulatory framework for approving novel foods, including insects, which ensures their safety for consumption. The promotion of insect-based food by organizations like the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Economic Forum due to its nutritional benefits and sustainability. Expert opinions denying health risks associated with approved edible insects. The spread of misinformation about edible insects through viral social media posts and far-right media outlets.

Therefore, the claim is deemed false.;The claim being evaluated is that edible insects are part of an international elite's plan to introduce a new world order, and that organizations like the World Economic Forum and the UN are promoting insects as food to control people's diets and impose an eco-dictatorship.False.The claim is false because it is based on misinformation and conspiracy theories. The evidence presented in the fact-check shows that the World Economic Forum and the UN promote edible insects due to their nutritional value, sustainability, and potential to help developing countries. The EU has approved certain types of insects as novel foods after risk assessments, and food products containing insects must be labeled as such. Researchers have also denied claims that insects are poisonous or carcinogenic. The fact-check reveals that the claim originates from far-right sources and social media posts that have been debunked by experts.;Fact-Check: No Evidence Edible Insects Are Part of a Globalist Conspiracy;The fact-check debunks the conspiracy that edible insects are part of a globalist plot. Evidence shows insects are promoted for their environmental and nutritional benefits, not control, with strict EU safety and labeling regulations ensuring transparency. Misinformation from social media and political figures fuels the false narrative, but the claim lacks credible support.;1. What is the Claim Being Evaluated?The fact-check paper assesses three primary claims about edible insects:Conspiracy Claim: Edible insects are part of an international elite’s plan, particularly linked to the World Economic Forum (WEF), to impose a new world order or eco-dictatorship, often tied to conspiracy theories like The Great Reset or Agenda 21.Health Claim: Insects are poisonous or carcinogenic due to chitin in their exoskeletons.Labeling Claim: The EU is misleading consumers by not clearly labeling foods containing insects, potentially tricking them into consuming insects.2. Is the Claim True, False, Mixed, or Other Relevant Category of Verdict?False3.

Opposition stems from misinformation and anti-globalist narratives, not facts. Thus, the verdict is False.
FC_06;Assertion;Correct, but also a bit misleading about emissions cuts;AssertionDuring the last year of last year, the Labor Party government has cut as much as all the last governments under Ola Svenneby and my lifetime.Astrid Hoem. Youth Party Leader Debate, Arendal Week 2024, 14.08.2024 ConclusionThis is true if we refer to emissions per year, and take 1990 as the starting point compared to 2022 and 2023. Preliminary figures show that greenhouse gas emissions in Norway in 2023 were 4.7 percent lower than the previous year, and 9.1 percent lower than in 1990. In 2022, emissions were 4.6 percent lower than in 1990.;This is the fact-check:Climate was one of the big topics when the youth party leaders met for a debate at Arendal Week. Among others, AUF's Astrid Hoem and Ola Svenneby from Unge Høyre met for a duel.With increasingly short speaking time, claims were made about whose government had built the most offshore wind turbines and who had cut greenhouse gas emissions the most.Now you can get Faktisk.no straight to your inbox.

She also suggested that the 2023 cut was equal to the total cut from 1990 to 2022.Conclusion:The claim is technically correct but misleading.    It is true that emissions dropped by 4.7% in 2023, about 2.3 million tonnes, which is roughly equal to the total reduction from 1990 to 2022.    However, larger total cuts occurred during the lifetimes of Hoem and Svenneby or under previous governments, especially after the 2007 emissions peak.    Emissions trends result from many long-term factors, and it is inaccurate to credit one government for short-term results.    Experts emphasize that emissions policies take time to show effects, and prior governments likely contributed to the recent reductions.;Verdict: Mixed Astrid Hoem's claim is partially true but misleading: ? True that the emissions cut in 2023 (4.7%) was roughly equal in size to the total cut from 1990 to 2022. ? Misleading because it implies that:   The current government alone is responsible for the cut,   No significant reductions happened under previous governments,   And that 2023’s cut outweighs or matches all cuts during their lifetimes or other government periods — which is not accurate when broader timelines or different reference years are used.Overall, the claim simplifies a complex issue and overstates the current government's contribution, making the verdict mixed.;Hoem's Climate Claim: 2023 Emissions Cuts Compared to Previous Years - Both Correct and Misleading;Assertion: AUF leader Astrid Hoem claimed that the Labor Party;The verdict for the fact-check is Mixed.;AUF Leader's Claim: 'We Cut Emissions as Much in One Year as Previous Governments in Our Lifetime' - Both Correct and Misleading;Assertion: Astrid Hoem, the leader of AUF (Workers' Youth League), claimed that the Labor Party government cut greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 by as much as all previous governments combined during her lifetime and that of Ola Svenneby, leader of Unge Høyre (Young Conservatives).Conclusion: The claim is both correct and misleading . According to Statistics Norway, the 4.7% decrease in emissions from 2022 to 2023 is significant, and the total reduction from 1990 to 2023 is 9.1%. When using 1990 as a reference year, the cuts in 2023 are roughly equivalent to the total cuts from 1990 to 2022. However, if you consider other time frames, such as the youth politicians' lifetimes or the period since emissions peaked in 2007, the picture is more complex, and the claim becomes misleading. ;The verdict for the fact-check on Astrid Hoem's claim is Both Correct and Misleading. According to the fact-check, Hoem's statement that the Labor Party government cut greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 by as much as all previous governments combined during her lifetime and that of Ola Svenneby is true when using 1990 as a reference year. However, the claim becomes misleading when considering other time frames, such as the youth politicians' lifetimes or the period since emissions peaked in 2007.Breakdown:Correct: The cuts in 2023 were roughly equivalent to the total cuts from 1990 to 2022, with a 9.1% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions since 1990.Misleading: The claim doesn't account for the complexity of emissions trends and the factors influencing them, such as policies, business, and societal trends. When looking at other time frames, like the politicians' lifetimes or the period since 2007, the picture is more nuanced ¹.;Norwegian Youth Leader’s Claim of Record Emissions Cuts in 2023 Is True but Misleading, Fact-Check Finds;Assertion: Astrid Hoem, AUF leader, claimed that the Labour Party;Verdict: MixedAstrid Hoem's claim is technically correct when comparing the 2023 greenhouse gas emissions cut (4.7%, or 2.3 million tonnes of CO? equivalents) to the total reduction from 1990 to 2022 (4.6%). However, it is misleading because it oversimplifies complex emissions trends, ignores significant cuts under previous governments (especially from 2013–2021), and exaggerates the current government's role in the 2023 reduction, which was influenced by factors like industry activity and electric car adoption.

What is the claim being verified in this fact-check?AUF leader Astrid Hoem claimed that the Labour government in 2023 cut as much greenhouse gas emissions in one year as all previous governments combined during her and Unge Høyre leader Ola Svenneby’s lifetimes. She also stated that the 2023 cut was equal to the total reduction from 1990 to 2022.2. What is the conclusion and what are the key reasons behind this?Conclusion: The claim is mixed — partly true but misleading.Key reasons: It is factually correct that emissions in 2023 dropped by 4.7%, about 2.3 million tonnes, which matches the total reduction from 1990 to 2022. However, this framing excludes important context:   Emissions fluctuated over time, with a peak in 2007, followed by significant reductions under earlier governments.   Using different reference years (like 1995 or 1997, the birth years of Hoem and Svenneby) changes the picture — total reductions during their lifetimes are greater than the 2023 cut alone.   Policy effects are delayed, so current reductions may result from earlier government actions (e.g., longstanding electric vehicle incentives). Experts note that no single government can claim full responsibility for emissions changes due to the complex and long-term nature of climate policy.Overall, while the numbers are technically accurate, the implication that the current government is solely responsible for such a major cut is misleading.;1. What is the claim being verified?AUF leader Astrid Hoem claimed that the Labour government cut as much greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 alone as all previous governments combined during her and Ola Svenneby’s lifetimes — or from 1990 to 2022.2. What is the final verdict?Verdict: Mixed3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict? ? True: According to Statistics Norway, greenhouse gas emissions in Norway dropped by 4.7% in 2023 — a reduction of 2.3 million tonnes, roughly equal to the total cut from 1990 to 2022. ? Misleading:   Long-term emissions trends show that substantial cuts also occurred during earlier governments, especially post-2007.   When using other reference years like 1995 or 1997, total reductions are larger than the 2023 cut alone.   Attributing the 2023 cut solely to the current government is problematic, since policy impacts often lag and previous governments’ initiatives (e.g., EV incentives) likely contributed to the drop.   Experts emphasize that emissions trends are driven by complex, long-term factors — not just by the actions of the sitting government.Conclusion: The claim is based on correct numbers but oversimplifies and exaggerates the Labour government's role, making the overall verdict Mixed.;Claim of Record Emission Cuts Under Current Government is Partially True But Misleading;What is the claim being verified in this fact-check?The claim being verified is Astrid Hoem's statement that the Labor Party;Alright, let's break down the verdict of this fact-check:1.

The Claim (Assertion):AUF leader Astrid Hoem claimed that in 2023, the Labour-led government cut as much greenhouse gas emissions in one year as had been cut by all previous governments combined during the lifetimes of today's youth politicians (i.e., since the mid-1990s).---2. The Evidence: Statistics Norway reported a 4.7% decrease in emissions from 2022 to 2023, equivalent to 2.3 million tonnes of CO?. Emissions were 4.6% lower in 2022 than in 1990, meaning the 2023 drop nearly matches all reductions from 1990 to 2022. Using 1990 as a baseline aligns with international climate targets. However, emissions peaked in 2007, and total cuts since then have been larger than in 2023 alone. Experts, including CICERO researcher Borgar Aamaas, note that multiple governments and long-term policies influenced current trends. External factors (e.g., economic slowdown, EV adoption, lower oil; 1. The Claim Being Assessed:The claim being assessed is made by Astrid Hoem (AUF leader), who stated:> We have cut as much \[greenhouse gas emissions] in one year (2023) as has been cut during our entire lifetime of government terms.This implies that the Labour-led government in 2023 achieved emission reductions equivalent to all reductions made by past governments during the lifetimes of the youth politicians (since 1995-1997).--- 2. The Verdict:Mixed – Both Correct and Misleading--- 3. Reasoning or Evidence Supporting the Decision: Supporting Evidence:   Statistics Norway reported that emissions fell by 4.7% in 2023, which is a significant drop, and roughly comparable to the total reduction from 1990 to 2022 (9.1% total reduction).   If we use 1990 as the baseline, the statement holds some validity in comparing the total 2023 drop to the total cut from 1990 to 2022. Contradictory Evidence:   The 2007 peak in emissions means that a significant portion of emission reductions occurred before 2023. In fact, since 2007, emissions have fallen by 17.4%, with 23% of this reduction occurring in 2023 alone.   The claim overlooks the role of previous governments, like those of Erna Solberg, whose policies also contributed significantly to the reduction in emissions.   Economic factors and the adoption of electric vehicles have contributed to emission reductions over time, not just the current government’s actions. Conclusion:   The claim is technically correct when considering the 1990 baseline and the total emissions reduction from 1990 to 2023. However, it is misleading because it oversimplifies the complex and gradual emission reductions over the years, attributing the entire 2023 cut solely to the current government while ignoring the contributions of previous governments and other external factors.Thus, the verdict is mixed, as the claim is accurate in some respects but misleading when the full context is considered.;Emission Cut Claim: Technically Accurate Based on One Metric, But Misleading Overall;1.

Assertion: What is the claim about?The claim, made by Astrid Hoem (AUF leader), is that the Labour-led government in 2023 reduced greenhouse gas emissions by as much in one year as had been cut by all previous governments during the lifetime of the youth politicians (since 1995–1997).--- 2. Conclusion: What are the key pieces of evidence mentioned in the fact-check that support or refute the claim? Supporting Evidence:   Statistics Norway reported a 4.7% decrease in emissions from 2022 to 2023, equivalent to 2.3 million tonnes of CO?.   This reduction is significant and brings the total reduction from 1990 to 2023 to 9.1%.   From 1990 to 2022, emissions decreased by 4.6%, so the 2023 drop is roughly the same size as the total reduction during that period. Contradictory Evidence:   The 2007 emissions peak means that reductions from 2007 to 2023 were actually more substantial (total 17.4% reduction), with 23% of that occurring in 2023.   Previous governments (such as Erna Solberg’s) contributed to the emission cuts over time, and the current government can’t be credited solely for the 2023 reduction.   External factors like economic conditions, lower oil; 1. What is the claim being evaluated?The claim being evaluated is made by Astrid Hoem (AUF leader), who stated:> We have cut as much \[greenhouse gas emissions] in one year (2023) as has been cut during our entire lifetime of government terms.This suggests that the Labour-led government in 2023 achieved emission reductions equal to or greater than all reductions made by previous governments during the lifetimes of the youth politicians (since 1995–1997).--- 2. Based on the evidence provided, is the claim true, false, mixed, or another verdict category?Verdict: Mixed--- 3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict? Supporting Evidence:   Statistics Norway reports a 4.7% reduction in emissions in 2023, equivalent to 2.3 million tonnes of CO?, which is a significant cut.   From 1990 to 2022, emissions had decreased by 4.6%, making the 2023 reduction roughly equal to the total reduction over that period. Contradictory Evidence:   The 2007 emissions peak means the total reduction since then is 17.4%, with 23% of this occurring in 2023.   Previous governments, such as Erna Solberg's, played a significant role in emission cuts, and the current government cannot be solely credited with the 2023 reduction.   Emission reductions are influenced by long-term policies, economic conditions, and other external factors (such as electric vehicle adoption), not just the actions of the current government.   The claim is based on a comparison to 1990, but starting from other years (such as 1995 or 1997) would show a larger total reduction under prior governments.--- Final Verdict:The claim is partially true in that the 2023 cut is significant and comparable to reductions made since 1990. However, it is misleading because it overlooks the contributions of previous governments and external factors. The 2007 emissions peak and long-term policies from earlier governments contributed heavily to the overall reduction. Thus, the claim is mixed—correct in part, but misleading in context.;Emission Cut Claim: As Big as 1990-2022 Progress, But Context Makes It Misleading;The fact-check evaluates Astrid Hoem's claim that the Labor Party government's emission cuts in 2023 were as significant as the total reductions achieved by previous governments during her and Ola Svenneby's lifetimes, or from 1990 to 2022. Evidence from Statistics Norway indicates that the 2023 emission decrease of 4.7% was indeed comparable to the 4.6% reduction between 1990 and 2022. However, the fact-check also highlights that when considering emission changes from other relevant starting points, such as the youth leaders' birth years or the peak emission year, the 2023 reduction appears less substantial. Furthermore, expert analysis emphasizes the complexity of emission trends, noting the influence of long-term policies and external factors, making it an oversimplification to attribute the 2023 decrease solely to the current government. Consequently, the final verdict is that Hoem's claim is technically correct under a specific interpretation but ultimately misleading due to a lack of broader context.;Here are the brief answers to your questions:1.  What is the claim being evaluated? The claim is Astrid Hoem's statement that the Labor Party government's emission cuts in 2023 were as large as the total reductions achieved by all previous governments combined during her and Ola Svenneby's lifetimes, or as much as the total emission cuts from 1990 to 2022.2.  Based on the evidence provided, is the claim true, false, mixed or another verdict category? Mixed.3.  What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict? The 2023 emission reduction was similar in size to the total reduction from 1990-2022, making it technically accurate under that comparison. However, this ignores larger reductions in other periods and the complex factors influencing emissions, making the claim misleading in a broader context.Final Verdict:The verdict for the fact-check is Mixed. While the claim is technically accurate when comparing the 2023 emission reduction to the total reduction between 1990 and 2022, it is misleading. This is because it overlooks larger overall emission reductions when considering different timeframes and oversimplifies the complex interplay of factors and long-term policies that contribute to emission trends, rather than solely attributing them to the current government's actions in one year.;AUF Leader's Claim on Emissions Cuts: Mixed Verdict;1.

In 2022, emissions were 4.6 percent lower than in 1990.;This is the fact-check:Climate was one of the big topics when the youth party leaders met for a debate at Arendal Week. Among others, AUF's Astrid Hoem and Ola Svenneby from Unge Høyre met for a duel.With increasingly short speaking time, claims were made about whose government had built the most offshore wind turbines and who had cut greenhouse gas emissions the most.Now you can get Faktisk.no straight to your inbox.

The Claim:The claim being evaluated is made by Astrid Hoem (AUF leader), who stated that in 2023, the Labour-led government reduced greenhouse gas emissions by as much in one year as all previous governments did during the lifetimes of today’s youth politicians (since 1995–1997). 2. Evidence and Verdict:The evidence shows that in 2023, emissions decreased by 4.7%, which is a significant reduction. This drop is roughly equivalent to the total reduction from 1990 to 2022. However, the claim is misleading because it oversimplifies the situation. While the 2023 reduction is notable, emissions have been decreasing steadily since 2007, and a large portion of the reduction in 2023 is linked to long-term policies and factors such as the adoption of electric vehicles and economic changes, not solely actions by the current government. Previous governments, such as Erna Solberg's, played a major role in the reduction trends over the years.Verdict: The claim is mixed — technically correct in some aspects but misleading because it ignores the broader context and contributions from past governments.; 1. What is the claim being assessed?The claim being assessed is made by Astrid Hoem (AUF leader), who stated that the Labour-led government in 2023 cut as much greenhouse gas emissions in one year as all previous governments did during the lifetimes of today’s youth politicians (since 1995–1997). 2. What is the final verdict?Mixed 3. Explain how the evidence supports the verdict in a clear and concise manner:The 2023 emissions cut of 4.7% is significant and comparable to the total reduction from 1990 to 2022. However, the claim overlooks important context. Emissions had already been decreasing steadily since 2007, and previous governments, such as Erna Solberg’s, played a large role in those reductions. The 2023 cut cannot be entirely credited to the current government, as factors like electric vehicle adoption and economic conditions also contributed. Thus, while the claim is partially true, it is misleading because it oversimplifies the situation and ignores the broader impact of past policies.;Emission Cut Claim: Technically Accurate in One Comparison, But Misleading Overall;Claim (Assertion): Astrid Hoem asserted that the current Labor Party government's greenhouse gas emission reductions in 2023 were as substantial as all the emission reductions achieved by previous governments during her and Ola Svenneby's lifetimes, or equivalently, the total emission reductions from 1990 to 2022.Evidence and Verdict (Conclusion): The fact-check revealed that while the 2023 emission reduction (a 4.7% decrease) matched the total reduction between 1990 and 2022, this comparison was narrowly focused. When considering other relevant periods, like the youth leaders' birth years or the peak emission year, the 2023 reduction was less significant. Experts also pointed out that emission changes are influenced by numerous long-term factors and policies from previous governments, not solely the current one. Therefore, the claim is mixed. It's technically accurate based on one specific comparison, but misleading in a broader context, as it oversimplifies the complex factors affecting emission trends.;Here's the verdict based on the fact-check:1.  What is the claim being assessed?    The claim being assessed is Astrid Hoem's statement that the Labor Party government's greenhouse gas emission cuts in 2023 were as large as the total reductions achieved by all previous governments combined during her and Ola Svenneby's lifetimes, or as much as the total emission cuts from 1990 to 2022.2.  What is the final verdict?    Mixed.3.  Explain how the evidence supports the verdict:    The evidence shows that the 4.7% emission reduction in 2023 was comparable in size to the total 4.6% reduction that occurred between 1990 and 2022. This makes the claim technically accurate under that specific comparison. However, the fact-check also demonstrates that when considering other relevant timeframes (like the birth years of Hoem and Svenneby or the peak emission year), the 2023 reduction appears less significant. Furthermore, experts emphasize that emission trends are influenced by a multitude of long-term factors and policies enacted by previous governments, making it an oversimplification to attribute the 2023 reduction solely to the current government. Therefore, while a narrow interpretation supports part of the claim, the broader context reveals it to be misleading.;AUF Leader's Claim on Emissions Cuts: Both Right and Misleading;Claim: Astrid Hoem, leader of AUF, claimed that the Labor Party government cut greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 as much as all previous governments combined during her and Ola Svenneby's lifetime.Evidence and Verdict:According to Statistics Norway, greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 4.7% in 2023 compared to 2022, which is a significant reduction.Emissions in 2023 were 9.1% lower than in 1990, a commonly used reference year for climate goals.The reduction in 2023 is roughly equivalent to the total emission cut between 1990 and 2022.However, when considering different starting years, such as Hoem's birth year (1995) or Svenneby's birth year (1997), the picture becomes more complex.Borgar Aamaas, senior researcher at Cicero Center for Climate Research, points out that emissions trends are influenced by various factors, including policies implemented by previous governments.Verdict: Hoem's claim is both correct and misleading. It's true that the 2023 reduction is comparable to the total cut between 1990 and 2022, but it doesn't account for the complexity of emissions trends over time and the impact of previous governments' policies. Additionally, the current government can't take sole credit for the emissions reduction. Overall, the claim is partially accurate but requires clarification and context to be fully understood ¹.;1. Claim: Astrid Hoem claimed that the Labor Party government cut greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 as much as all previous governments combined during her and Ola Svenneby's lifetime.2. Final Verdict: Mixed3. Explanation: The evidence supports a mixed verdict because Hoem's claim is both correct and misleading. According to Statistics Norway, the 4.7% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 is a significant reduction, and the total cut in 2023 is roughly equivalent to the total emission cut between 1990 and 2022. However, when considering different starting points, such as the politicians' birth years or the peak emission year (2007), the picture becomes more complex, and the claim doesn't fully capture the nuances of emissions trends over time. Additionally, the current government can't take sole credit for the emissions reduction due to the impact of previous policies.

Key Evidence and Verdict: Evidence:   Statistics Norway reported that emissions in 2023 decreased by 4.7%, or 2.3 million tonnes of CO?.   This reduction is comparable to the total reduction from 1990 to 2022 (a 9.1% total reduction).   However, 2007 emissions peak and reductions since then (particularly a 17.4% decrease since 2007) must also be considered. The 2023 cut accounted for 23% of this reduction.   Emission reductions have been influenced by long-term policies, economic conditions, and the rise in electric vehicles, not just actions of the current government. Verdict: The claim is mixed. While it is partially true that the 2023 cut is significant, it is misleading because it ignores the role of past governments and the broader context of emission reduction over time. Conclusion:The claim that the 2023 emissions cut matches all previous reductions is partially true, but it is misleading by oversimplifying the complex factors and ignoring the contributions of past policies. The final verdict is mixed.; 1. What is the claim being evaluated?The claim being evaluated is made by Astrid Hoem (AUF leader), who stated that the Labour-led government in 2023 cut as much greenhouse gas emissions in one year as all previous governments did during the lifetimes of today’s youth politicians (since 1995–1997). 2. Is the claim true, false, or mixed or other relevant category of verdict?Mixed 3. Provide a brief explanation for your decision based on the evidence presented in the fact-check.The 2023 emissions cut of 4.7% is significant and comparable to the total reduction from 1990 to 2022, supporting the claim to some extent. However, the claim is misleading because it oversimplifies the situation. Emissions had been decreasing steadily since 2007, and prior governments (like Erna Solberg’s) contributed significantly to those reductions. The 2023 cut is also influenced by factors such as electric vehicle adoption and economic conditions, not solely the actions of the current government. Therefore, the claim is partially true but misleading in context, leading to a mixed verdict.;Emission Cut Claim: As Big as 1990-2022 Progress, But Context Shows a Mixed Picture;Claim (Assertion): Astrid Hoem claimed that the Labor Party government's greenhouse gas emission reductions in 2023 were as substantial as all the emission reductions achieved by previous governments during her and Ola Svenneby's lifetimes, or equivalently, the total emission reductions from 1990 to 2022.Evidence and Verdict (Conclusion): The fact-check found that while the 4.7% emission decrease in 2023 was similar in size to the 4.6% decrease between 1990 and 2022, this comparison is narrow. When considering other relevant periods, like the youth leaders' birth years or the peak emission year, the 2023 reduction appears less significant. Experts also noted that emission trends are complex and influenced by long-term factors and policies of previous governments. Therefore, the verdict is Mixed: the claim is technically accurate based on one specific comparison but misleading in a broader context.;Here's the verdict for the fact-check:1.  What is the claim being evaluated?    The claim being evaluated is Astrid Hoem's statement that the Labor Party government's greenhouse gas emission cuts in 2023 were as large as the total reductions achieved by all previous governments combined during her and Ola Svenneby's lifetimes, or as much as the total emission cuts from 1990 to 2022.2.  Is the claim true, false, or mixed?    Mixed.3.  Provide a brief explanation for your decision based on the evidence presented:    The verdict is Mixed because the fact-check found that while the 4.7% emission reduction in 2023 was comparable in size to the total 4.6% reduction between 1990 and 2022, this is a limited comparison. When considering other relevant timeframes, the 2023 reduction is less significant. Furthermore, experts highlight that emission trends are influenced by many long-term factors, including policies of previous governments, making it misleading to attribute the 2023 decrease solely to the current administration.;Mixed Verdict: AUF Leader's Claim on Record Emissions Cuts Partly True, Partly Misleading;Claim: Astrid Hoem, AUF leader, claimed that the Labor Party government cut greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 as much as all previous governments combined during her and Ola Svenneby's lifetime, stating: We have cut as much in one year last year as has been cut during our entire lifetime of government terms.Evidence and Verdict: The fact-check evaluated Statistics Norway's preliminary figures, which showed a 4.7% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions in 2023, and compared emissions trends from different starting points (1990, 1995, 1997, and 2007). The verdict is Mixed: while the claim is true when comparing the 2023 reduction to the total cut between 1990 and 2022, it's misleading as it doesn't account for the complexity of emissions trends over time and the impact of previous governments' policies. The current government can't take sole credit for the emissions reduction.;1.

The numbers in the posts are partially correct. But the conclusion is not, researchers tell TjekDet.;This is the fact-check: How can one ever believe that humans have any influence on the climate in the big picture, when man-made CO2 only constitutes a “vanishingly small fraction” of 0.0016 percent of the total CO2 concentration in the atmosphere of 0.04 percent?This is what is stated in numerous Facebook posts , where the claim is used to downplay the role of humans in climate change. The conclusion in the posts is that the man-made CO 2 in the atmosphere has absolutely no influence.Along with the claims, a graph is shared that supposedly illustrates the composition of the gases that make up the atmosphere.

Because even a small change in the amount of CO 2  has an impact on global warming, shows a previous fact check from TjekDet , which includes some of the same claims.CO2 emissions in the big picturePeter Langen , a professor at the Department of Environmental Science at Aarhus University, told TjekDet last year that it is correct that 0.04 percent of the air molecules in the atmosphere are CO2 molecules . But even though the percentage may seem quite small, its significance cannot be ignored. Before we humans started changing things, there was between 0.02 and 0.03 percent CO 2 in the atmosphere. We humans have caused the concentration to increase to 0.04 percent. And this change has contributed greatly to the increase in temperature on Earth, Peter Langen explained to TjekDet.He has previously come across the figure 0.04 percent, where it is used as an argument that human CO2 emissions have no significance in the big picture. So is Sebastian Mernild , who is professor and head of the SDU Climate Cluster at the University of Southern Denmark.He explained to TjekDet that a different unit of measurement is typically used, namely parts per million (ppm), which refers to the concentration of - in this case - CO2 molecules per million molecules in the air. And according to Sebastian Mernild, it will typically fluctuate naturally between 180 ppm when we have an ice age, and 280 ppm when we have an interglacial period , which we have now.CheckedThe rise in CO2 in the atmosphere has caused temperatures to rise. And there is no doubt that human interference plays a significant role, say researchers. Photo: NOAA;Vanilla;Claim That Human CO? Emissions Are Too Small to Impact Climate Is False, Experts Say;Human-caused CO? has a significant impact: Although man-made CO? is a small fraction of the atmosphere's total composition (0.0016% of air molecules), even small increases in CO? levels—from around 280 ppm to over 420 ppm—have greatly influenced global warming. This change is almost entirely due to human activity.Misleading comparison in Facebook posts: Posts claiming human CO? emissions are insignificant use misleading graphics and percentages to downplay their impact. Experts clarify that the change in CO? concentration, not just its total share, is what drives climate change.Incorrect emissions data for Europe: The claim that Europe contributes 16% of global human-caused CO? emissions is false. The correct figure, according to the EU Commission’s Joint Research Center, is 6.4% as of 2023.;Verdict: FalseThe claim that human-caused CO? emissions are insignificant because they constitute only a tiny fraction of atmospheric gases is false. Scientists agree that even small increases in CO? concentration—driven largely by human activity—have a substantial effect on global temperatures. Additionally, the claim misrepresents both the scientific context of CO?’s role in climate change and the actual data on Europe's emissions.;False: Claim That Human CO2 Emissions Have No Significant Climate Influence Debunked by Scientists;The claim that human-made CO2 constitutes a vanishingly small fraction of total atmospheric CO2, rendering its impact insignificant, is false. While CO2 is 0.04% of the atmosphere, human activity has increased its concentration from 0.02-0.03% pre-industrial levels to 0.04% currently (or from 280 ppm to 420 ppm), which is a significant increase beyond natural fluctuations and directly contributes to global warming.Experts confirm that even a small change in atmospheric CO2 concentration has a substantial impact on global warming. The significant increase in CO2 since the mid-19th century is almost entirely attributable to human activities, creating an imbalance in the climate system and leading to warmer conditions globally.The assertion that Europe contributes 16% of total human-caused CO2 emissions is incorrect. According to the EU Commission's Joint Research Center (JRC), EU member states' share of global CO2 emissions was 6.4% in 2023.;The verdict for the fact-check is False.;Claim that human CO2 emissions don't matter because they're a tiny fraction of the atmosphere is misleading;The claim that human-caused CO2 emissions are insignificant because they constitute a small fraction (0.0016%) of the atmosphere is misleading. Experts say even small changes in CO2 levels can significantly impact global warming.    CO2 levels have risen from 280 parts per million (ppm) to 420 ppm due to human activity, far beyond the natural range, contributing to increased temperatures.    Another claim in the Facebook posts, that Europe contributes 16% of global CO2 emissions, is also incorrect.

Emissions Are Too Small to Affect Climate, Experts Confirm;  What is the claim being verified in this fact-check?    The claim is that human-caused CO? emissions are insignificant and have no impact on the climate because they represent only a tiny fraction (0.0016%) of the total atmospheric CO? concentration (0.04%).    What is the main evidence used to support or refute this claim?    Climate scientists and experts explain that even small changes in atmospheric CO? levels have a significant impact on global temperatures. Human activity has increased CO? concentrations from about 280 ppm to over 420 ppm, which is directly linked to global warming. Additionally, the posts misstate Europe's share of global emissions, which is actually 6.4%, not 16%.    What is the verdict given in the fact-check, and what are the key reasons behind this verdict?    Verdict: False    The claim is false because it ignores the scientific consensus that even small increases in CO? levels—mostly caused by humans—significantly affect the climate. Misleading graphics and incorrect data further weaken the credibility of the claim.;Here are the answers to the verdict determination questions:1. What is the claim being verified?   The claim is that human-caused CO? emissions are too small to have any significant impact on the climate because they make up only a tiny fraction (0.0016%) of the atmosphere's total CO? content (0.04%).2. What is the final verdict?   False3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict?    Experts explain that while the overall concentration of CO? in the atmosphere is small, even slight increases—such as the rise from 280 ppm to over 420 ppm—have a large impact on global temperatures.    This rise is almost entirely due to human activity, particularly since the mid-19th century.    The argument presented in the Facebook posts uses misleading comparisons and ignores the scientific understanding of how CO? affects the climate system.    The posts also falsely claim Europe contributes 16% of global CO? emissions, while the actual figure is 6.4% according to the EU Commission's Joint Research Center.; Fact Check: No, Vanishingly Small Human CO2 Is Still Driving Climate Change;1.  What is the claim being verified in this fact-check?    The claim being verified is that human-made CO2 constitutes such a vanishingly small fraction (specifically, 0.0016 percent) of the total CO2 concentration in the atmosphere (0.04 percent) that it has absolutely no influence on the climate. This claim is used to downplay the role of humans in climate change. An additional claim about Europe's share of world CO2 emissions (16%) is also addressed.2.  What is the main evidence used to support or refute this claim?    The main evidence used to refute the claim comes from interviews with multiple climate professors and researchers:     Peter Langen (Aarhus University): Confirms the 0.04% figure for atmospheric CO2 but emphasizes that human activity has increased this from a natural range of 0.02-0.03%, significantly impacting global temperatures.     Sebastian Mernild (SDU Climate Cluster): Explains that CO2 concentration is typically measured in parts per million (ppm). While natural fluctuations are between 180 ppm (ice age) and 280 ppm (interglacial), the current level is 420 ppm, far exceeding the natural range. He states this human-caused increase unequivocally influences the climate system. He also cites the IPCC's assessment that 1.07 out of 1.09 degrees of warming since 1850 are human-made.     Eigil Kaas (National Center for Climate Research at DMI): States that humans are responsible for the vast majority of the increase in atmospheric carbon, nearly one to one man-made from the mid-19th century (around 280 ppm) to the current 425 ppm.     Joint Research Center (JRC) report: Refutes the claim about Europe's CO2 emissions, stating the EU member states' share of world CO2 emissions was 6.4% in 2023, not 16%.3.  What is the verdict given in the fact-check, and what are the key reasons behind this verdict?    The verdict is False.    The key reasons behind this verdict are:     While the absolute percentage of CO2 in the atmosphere may seem small (0.04%), the crucial factor is the change in concentration caused by human activity. This increase, from pre-industrial levels of 0.02-0.03% (or 280 ppm) to current levels of 0.04% (or 420-425 ppm), is a significant departure from natural fluctuations and has a demonstrable impact on global temperatures.     Climate scientists unequivocally state that this human-induced increase in CO2 is directly responsible for the observed warming of the climate system.     The claim regarding Europe's share of global CO2 emissions is also factually incorrect, with official data showing a much lower percentage.;1.  What is the claim being verified?    The central claim being verified is that human-made CO2 has no influence on the climate because it constitutes a vanishingly small fraction (0.0016%) of the total CO2 concentration (0.04%) in the atmosphere. An additional claim about Europe's contribution to global CO2 emissions (16%) is also examined.2.

What is the claim being verified in this fact-check?The fact-check verifies two main claims from social media posts: (a) that human-made CO2, constituting only 0.0016% of the total 0.04% CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, has no significant influence on climate change, and (b) that Europe contributes 16% of global human-caused CO2 emissions.2. What is the main evidence used to support or refute this claim?CO2 Impact: Experts (Peter Langen, Sebastian Mernild, Eigil Kaas) confirm that human activities have increased atmospheric CO2 from 280 ppm (pre-industrial) to 420 ppm, far exceeding natural ranges (180–280 ppm). This rise, nearly entirely human-caused, has driven a 1.07°C temperature increase since 1850, per the IPCC.Europe’s Emissions: The EU Joint Research Center (JRC) reports that EU member states contributed 6.4% of global CO2 emissions in 2023, not 16% as claimed. Germany, France, Italy, Poland, and Spain are the top EU emitters.3. What is the verdict given in the fact-check, and what are the key reasons behind this verdict?Verdict: FalseKey Reasons:The claim that human CO2 emissions are insignificant is false because, despite being a small fraction of total CO2, they have significantly raised atmospheric CO2 levels, causing substantial climate warming.The claim about Europe’s 16% share of global emissions is false, as the actual figure is 6.4%, according to the EU’s 2023 data.;1.

FC_07;Bullet point summary;Posts about anthropogenic CO2 in the atmosphere use partially correct figures to draw completely wrong conclusions;Man-made CO2 constitutes such a tiny fraction of the atmosphere that it has absolutely no impact on climate change. This is what several Facebook posts say, where CO2's share of the atmosphere is stated to be only 0.04 percent and humans' contribution to only 0.0016 percent of the total CO2 concentration. The numbers in the posts are partially correct. But the conclusion is not, researchers tell TjekDet.;This is the fact-check: How can one ever believe that humans have any influence on the climate in the big picture, when man-made CO2 only constitutes a “vanishingly small fraction” of 0.0016 percent of the total CO2 concentration in the atmosphere of 0.04 percent?This is what is stated in numerous Facebook posts , where the claim is used to downplay the role of humans in climate change. The conclusion in the posts is that the man-made CO 2 in the atmosphere has absolutely no influence.Along with the claims, a graph is shared that supposedly illustrates the composition of the gases that make up the atmosphere. Here, human-caused CO2 emissions - the tiny white dot in the right corner - are compared with the total CO2 concentration - the green dots - in the Earth's atmosphere.ZeroPhoto: Screenshot of Facebook postBut neither the graph nor the numbers are proof that humans' spread of CO 2 in the atmosphere is insignificant. Because even a small change in the amount of CO 2  has an impact on global warming, shows a previous fact check from TjekDet , which includes some of the same claims.CO2 emissions in the big picturePeter Langen , a professor at the Department of Environmental Science at Aarhus University, told TjekDet last year that it is correct that 0.04 percent of the air molecules in the atmosphere are CO2 molecules . But even though the percentage may seem quite small, its significance cannot be ignored. Before we humans started changing things, there was between 0.02 and 0.03 percent CO 2 in the atmosphere. We humans have caused the concentration to increase to 0.04 percent. And this change has contributed greatly to the increase in temperature on Earth, Peter Langen explained to TjekDet.He has previously come across the figure 0.04 percent, where it is used as an argument that human CO2 emissions have no significance in the big picture. So is Sebastian Mernild , who is professor and head of the SDU Climate Cluster at the University of Southern Denmark.He explained to TjekDet that a different unit of measurement is typically used, namely parts per million (ppm), which refers to the concentration of - in this case - CO2 molecules per million molecules in the air. And according to Sebastian Mernild, it will typically fluctuate naturally between 180 ppm when we have an ice age, and 280 ppm when we have an interglacial period , which we have now.CheckedThe rise in CO2 in the atmosphere has caused temperatures to rise. And there is no doubt that human interference plays a significant role, say researchers. Photo: NOAA;Chain-of-Thought;False Claim: Human CO? Emissions Too Small to Affect Climate, Say Experts;1. The Claim Being EvaluatedThe core claim being verified is that human-caused CO? emissions are insignificant in the context of global climate change because they make up only a tiny fraction—0.0016%—of the total atmosphere, which contains about 0.04% CO?. This claim, widely shared on Facebook, argues that such a small share cannot possibly influence global temperatures.2. Evidence Used to Assess the ClaimMultiple climate experts and scientific sources refute this claim by emphasizing:    Historical CO? Levels: Before human industrial activity, CO? concentrations ranged between 180–280 ppm. Today, levels have risen to over 420 ppm, largely due to human activities such as fossil fuel burning.    Impact of Small Changes: Even small shifts in atmospheric CO? concentration can lead to significant temperature changes. Scientists confirm that this increase is closely tied to global warming.    Scientific Consensus: Institutions like the IPCC conclude that the rise in average global temperature (about 1.09°C since 1850) is almost entirely human-induced.    Misleading Comparisons: The argument that CO? is “too small” in percentage ignores the fact that certain trace gases, including CO?, have outsized effects on the climate.    Incorrect Emissions Data: The claim that Europe contributes 16% of global CO? emissions is also false, the accurate figure from 2023 is 6.4%, per the EU Commission’s Joint Research Center.3. The VerdictVerdict: FalseThe claim is false because:    It misinterprets scientific facts, using the small percentage of atmospheric CO? to wrongly suggest it lacks influence, when in reality, small increases in CO? have a major impact on Earth’s climate.    It uses misleading graphics and numbers to support a flawed argument.    It cites inaccurate statistics, such as the overstated role of Europe in global emissions.Experts agree that human activities are the primary driver of the recent increase in atmospheric CO?, which is a key factor in current climate change.;1. Identify the Claim Being EvaluatedThe claim is that human-caused CO? emissions are too small—only 0.0016% of the atmosphere—to have any significant impact on the climate, and therefore, human influence on climate change is negligible.2. Review the Key Evidence Provided    Scientific Context: Although CO? makes up a small fraction of the atmosphere (0.04%), even small increases in its concentration have a powerful warming effect due to its role as a greenhouse gas.    Historical CO? Levels: Pre-industrial CO? levels were around 280 ppm, and have now risen to over 420 ppm, a change almost entirely caused by human activity.    Climate Impact: The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) attributes 1.07°C of the 1.09°C global temperature rise since 1850 to human activities.    Expert Opinion: Multiple climate scientists confirm that human-caused emissions are the main driver of the rise in CO? and the resulting climate changes.    False Statistical Claim: The assertion that Europe contributes 16% of global CO? emissions is inaccurate, the correct figure is 6.4%, according to the EU’s Joint Research Center.3. Final Verdict and JustificationVerdict: FalseJustification:    The claim misrepresents the science by focusing on the absolute size of CO? in the atmosphere rather than its climatic effect.    The argument ignores how small but sustained increases in CO? concentrations have led to measurable global warming.    Credible scientific authorities and data directly contradict the claim and confirm the significant role of human activity in altering atmospheric CO? levels and climate outcomes.;Fact Check: False – Small Human CO2 Share Still Drives Major Climate Change;1.  Identify and explain the claim that is being evaluated in this fact-check.    The core claim being evaluated is that human-made CO2 has no discernible influence on the Earth's climate because it constitutes a vanishingly small fraction (stated as 0.0016%) of the total CO2 concentration in the atmosphere (0.04%). This assertion is used to downplay the human role in climate change. An additional, secondary claim evaluated is that Europe contributes 16% of total human-caused CO2 emissions.2.  Examine the main evidence provided to assess the truthfulness of this claim.    The fact-check refutes the claim using evidence from multiple climate scientists and official data:     On the significance of CO2 concentration:         Professor Peter Langen (Aarhus University) confirms the 0.04% total CO2 figure but highlights that humans have increased this concentration from pre-industrial levels of 0.02-0.03%, and this change has significantly contributed to Earth's temperature rise.         Professor Sebastian Mernild (SDU Climate Cluster) explains that using parts per million (ppm) is more typical. He states that natural fluctuations range from 180 ppm (ice age) to 280 ppm (interglacial periods), but the current concentration is 420 ppm, far exceeding the natural range. He explicitly states that this human-influenced increase in concentrations has warmed the climate system. He also cites the UN's IPCC assessment that 1.07 of the 1.09 degrees Celsius average temperature increase since 1850 is attributable to human-made causes.         Professor Eigil Kaas (National Center for Climate Research at DMI) emphasizes that humans are responsible for almost the entirety of the increase in atmospheric carbon from around 280 ppm in the mid-19th century to around 425 ppm currently, which has created an imbalance in the climate system.     On Europe's CO2 emissions:         The Joint Research Center (JRC) report from the EU Commission's research service is cited, stating that EU member states' share of world CO2 emissions was 6.4% in 2023, not the claimed 16%.3.  Conclude with the verdict given in the fact-check. What is the final decision, and what reasons or arguments are provided to justify this conclusion? Make sure to include any key explanations that led to the verdict.    The final verdict of the fact-check is False.    The key reasons and arguments justifying this conclusion are:     The absolute percentage is misleading without context: While 0.04% might seem small in isolation, the critical factor for climate impact is the change in concentration. Human activities have demonstrably increased atmospheric CO2 from its natural pre-industrial levels to concentrations unprecedented in hundreds of thousands of years.     Even small changes have significant impacts: Climate science shows that even seemingly small increases in greenhouse gas concentrations can have a profound effect on the Earth's energy balance and lead to global warming. The rise from 280 ppm to 420 ppm is a substantial and impactful change in the context of the atmosphere's composition.     Clear Human Attribution: Scientific consensus, supported by the interviewed experts and the IPCC, firmly establishes that the observed increase in atmospheric CO2 and the resulting global temperature rise are overwhelmingly caused by human activities.     Inaccurate Supporting Data: The claim about Europe's 16% share of global CO2 emissions is factually incorrect according to official EU data, which places it at 6.4%.;1.  Identify the claim being evaluated.    The primary claim being evaluated is that human-made CO2 has no influence on the climate because it constitutes an insignificant fraction (0.0016%) of the total CO2 concentration (0.04%) in the atmosphere. A secondary claim states that Europe contributes 16% of total human-caused CO2 emissions.2.  Review the key evidence provided to assess the claim.    The fact-check presents several pieces of evidence from climate experts and official sources to counter the claim:     CO2 Concentration and Impact:         Scientists confirm the 0.04% figure for total atmospheric CO2 but emphasize that human activities have increased this from a pre-industrial range of 0.02-0.03%.         Using parts per million (ppm), experts note that natural fluctuations of CO2 are between 180 ppm (ice age) and 280 ppm (interglacial periods), but the current concentration is significantly higher at 420-425 ppm.         This human-caused increase is directly linked to the rise in global temperatures, for instance, the IPCC attributes 1.07 out of 1.09 degrees of warming since 1850 to human activities.         The change in CO2 concentration from the mid-19th century to now is described as almost one to one man-made, creating an imbalance in the climate system.     Europe's Emissions Share:         The Joint Research Center (JRC) report indicates that EU member states' share of world CO2 emissions was 6.4% in 2023, not 16%.3.  Based on this evidence, determine whether the claim is true, false, or mixed or another relevant verdict category. Justify your decision with relevant facts.    Verdict: False    Justification:    The core claim that human CO2 emissions are insignificant due to their small percentage is false because:     Context matters more than absolute percentage: While 0.04% seems small, the critical factor is the change from historical natural levels (0.02-0.03% or 280 ppm) to current human-induced levels (0.04% or 420-425 ppm). This increase is substantial and unprecedented in recent geological history, directly causing a warming effect.     Scientific consensus on human attribution: Leading climate scientists and international bodies like the IPCC unequivocally state that the observed increase in atmospheric CO2 and the resulting global warming are overwhelmingly due to human activities. Even a seemingly small change in the concentration of a powerful greenhouse gas like CO2 can have a significant impact on the Earth's energy balance.     Empirical evidence of warming: The direct link between rising CO2 levels and global temperature increases is well-established, with human activities identified as the primary driver of nearly all warming since the mid-19th century.    The secondary claim regarding Europe's 16% share of emissions is also false, as official data from the JRC shows the figure to be 6.4%.;False Claim: Human CO2 Emissions Too Small to Impact Climate Change;Step 1: Identify and explain the claimThe claim being evaluated is that human-caused CO2 emissions are insignificant and have no impact on climate change because they constitute a very small fraction (0.0016%) of the total CO2 concentration in the atmosphere.

Identify and explain the claim being evaluated in this fact-checkThe fact-check evaluates two primary claims from social media posts:- Claim 1: Human-made CO2, described as a “vanishingly small fraction” of 0.0016% of the total 0.04% CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, has no significant influence on climate change. This claim is used to argue that human CO2 emissions are negligible in the context of global climate dynamics.- Claim 2: Europe contributes 16% of global human-caused CO2 emissions. These claims are often accompanied by a graph illustrating the small proportion of human-caused CO2 compared to total atmospheric CO2 to downplay human impact on climate change.2. Examine the main evidence provided to assess the truthfulness of this claim- Evidence for Claim 1 (Human CO2 Impact):- Experts, including Peter Langen (Aarhus University), Sebastian Mernild (University of Southern Denmark), and Eigil Kaas (Danish Meteorological Institute), confirm that while total atmospheric CO2 is 0.04% (420 ppm), human activities have significantly increased this from a pre-industrial range of 280 ppm to 420 ppm, exceeding natural fluctuations (180–280 ppm between ice ages and interglacial periods).- The IPCC reports that since 1850, global temperatures have risen by 1.09°C, with 1.07°C attributed to human activities, primarily CO2 emissions. This demonstrates that even small increases in CO2 concentration have a substantial warming effect.- Eigil Kaas emphasizes that the majority of the CO2 increase since the mid-19th century is human-caused, creating a significant imbalance in the climate system.- Evidence for Claim 2 (Europe’s CO2 Emissions):- The EU Commission’s Joint Research Center (JRC) data for 2023 shows that EU member states contributed 6.4% of global CO2 emissions, not 16% as claimed.- Within the EU, Germany is the largest emitter, followed by France, Italy, Poland, and Spain, but the collective EU share is significantly lower than the social media claim.3. Conclude with the verdict given in the fact-check- Verdict: False- Reasons and Arguments:- For Claim 1: The assertion that human CO2 emissions are insignificant due to their small fraction (0.0016%) of total atmospheric CO2 is false. Despite the small percentage, human activities have driven CO2 levels from 280 ppm to 420 ppm, far beyond natural ranges, contributing to a 1.07°C global temperature increase since 1850. Experts confirm this increase is almost entirely human-caused and has a significant impact on global warming, contradicting the claim that it has “no influence.”- For Claim 2: The claim that Europe accounts for 16% of global human-caused CO2 emissions is false, as JRC data confirms the EU’s share is only 6.4% in 2023.- The misleading graph and figures in the social media posts fail to account for the cumulative and disproportionate impact of human CO2 emissions and overstate Europe’s contribution, leading to the false verdict for both claims.;1. Identify the claim being evaluatedThe fact-check evaluates two claims from social media posts:- Claim 1: Human-made CO2, constituting 0.0016% of the total 0.04% CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, has no significant influence on climate change, as it is a vanishingly small fraction.- Claim 2: Europe contributes 16% of global human-caused CO2 emissions.2. Review the key evidence provided to assess the claim- Evidence for Claim 1 (Human CO2 Impact):- Experts (Peter Langen, Sebastian Mernild, Eigil Kaas) confirm that human activities have increased atmospheric CO2 from 280 ppm (pre-industrial) to 420 ppm, exceeding natural fluctuations (180–280 ppm).- The IPCC attributes 1.07°C of the 1.09°C global temperature rise since 1850 to human activities, primarily CO2 emissions, showing that even small CO2 increases have significant warming effects.- Eigil Kaas notes that nearly all CO2 increases since the mid-19th century are human-caused, creating a climate system imbalance.- Evidence for Claim 2 (Europe’s CO2 Emissions):- The EU Joint Research Center (JRC) data for 2023 states that EU member states contributed 6.4% of global CO2 emissions, not 16%.- Germany is the largest EU emitter, followed by France, Italy, Poland, and Spain.3. Determine the verdict and justify with relevant facts- Verdict: False- Justification:- Claim 1: The assertion that human CO2 emissions are insignificant due to their small fraction (0.0016%) is false. The increase from 280 ppm to 420 ppm, driven almost entirely by human activities, has caused significant global warming (1.07°C since 1850), contradicting the claim of no influence.- Claim 2: The claim that Europe accounts for 16% of global human-caused CO2 emissions is false, as JRC data confirms the EU’s share is 6.4% in 2023.Both claims are incorrect based on scientific evidence and authoritative data, leading to a False verdict.

Here, human-caused CO2 emissions - the tiny white dot in the right corner - are compared with the total CO2 concentration - the green dots - in the Earth's atmosphere.ZeroPhoto: Screenshot of Facebook postBut neither the graph nor the numbers are proof that humans' spread of CO 2 in the atmosphere is insignificant. Because even a small change in the amount of CO 2  has an impact on global warming, shows a previous fact check from TjekDet , which includes some of the same claims.CO2 emissions in the big picturePeter Langen , a professor at the Department of Environmental Science at Aarhus University, told TjekDet last year that it is correct that 0.04 percent of the air molecules in the atmosphere are CO2 molecules . But even though the percentage may seem quite small, its significance cannot be ignored. Before we humans started changing things, there was between 0.02 and 0.03 percent CO 2 in the atmosphere. We humans have caused the concentration to increase to 0.04 percent. And this change has contributed greatly to the increase in temperature on Earth, Peter Langen explained to TjekDet.He has previously come across the figure 0.04 percent, where it is used as an argument that human CO2 emissions have no significance in the big picture. So is Sebastian Mernild , who is professor and head of the SDU Climate Cluster at the University of Southern Denmark.He explained to TjekDet that a different unit of measurement is typically used, namely parts per million (ppm), which refers to the concentration of - in this case - CO2 molecules per million molecules in the air. And according to Sebastian Mernild, it will typically fluctuate naturally between 180 ppm when we have an ice age, and 280 ppm when we have an interglacial period , which we have now.CheckedThe rise in CO2 in the atmosphere has caused temperatures to rise. And there is no doubt that human interference plays a significant role, say researchers. Photo: NOAA;Contextual;Claim That Human CO? Emissions Are Too Small to Impact Climate Is False, Experts Confirm;The Claim:    The claim being assessed is that human-caused CO? emissions are insignificant in influencing the climate because they constitute only 0.0016% of the atmosphere, and thus have no meaningful effect on global warming. This argument is circulated in Facebook posts using misleading graphics and percentages.    The Evidence:    Experts clarify that while CO? makes up a small portion of the atmosphere (0.04%), even slight increases—such as the rise from 280 ppm in pre-industrial times to over 420 ppm today—have a significant impact on global temperatures. This rise is primarily due to human activities like fossil fuel combustion. Climate scientists and institutions such as the IPCC attribute nearly all recent global warming to human-caused CO? emissions. The posts also falsely claim that Europe contributes 16% of global CO? emissions, while the actual figure is 6.4%, according to the EU Commission's Joint Research Center.    The Verdict:    False.    The claim is incorrect because it misrepresents how atmospheric CO? functions and ignores the well-established scientific consensus that even small increases in CO?, largely caused by humans, are a major driver of climate change.;Final Verdict:1. What is the claim being assessed?   The claim is that human-caused CO? emissions are too small—only 0.0016% of the atmosphere—to significantly influence the climate, and therefore have no meaningful impact on global warming.2. What is the verdict?   False3. What reasoning or evidence supports this decision?   The claim is false because it misrepresents the role of CO? in climate change. While CO? constitutes a small percentage of the atmosphere (around 0.04%), even small increases in its concentration—driven primarily by human activities—have been scientifically proven to significantly warm the planet. CO? levels have risen from 280 ppm to over 420 ppm since the Industrial Revolution, a change almost entirely due to human emissions. This increase is directly linked to the rise in global temperatures, with the IPCC attributing nearly all recent warming to human activity. Experts stress that the impact of CO? is not about its absolute percentage, but its climate sensitivity and radiative forcing effect. Additionally, the claim includes a false statistic about Europe’s CO? emissions share, which is 6.4%, not 16%.These points confirm that the argument made in the claim is scientifically inaccurate and misleading.;False – Tiny Human CO2 Emissions Are Indeed Driving Climate Change;Here's a concise summary of the fact-check:1.  The Claim: The claim asserts that human-made CO2 has no influence on the climate because it represents an insignificant fraction (0.0016%) of the total CO2 concentration (0.04%) in the atmosphere. It suggests this small proportion means human emissions are irrelevant to climate change. A secondary claim states Europe contributes 16% of global human-caused CO2 emissions.2.  The Evidence: Climate professors and researchers refute the claim by explaining that while CO2 is a small percentage, human activities have significantly increased its concentration from pre-industrial levels (0.02-0.03% or 280 ppm) to current levels (0.04% or 420-425 ppm), which is far beyond natural fluctuations. They emphasize that this human-induced change directly drives global warming, with the IPCC attributing 1.07 of 1.09 degrees Celsius of warming since 1850 to human causes. Regarding Europe's emissions, the EU Commission's Joint Research Center (JRC) report for 2023 indicates the EU's share was 6.4%, not 16%.3.  The Verdict: False. The claim is false because scientific evidence clearly demonstrates that the human-caused increase in atmospheric CO2, despite its seemingly small percentage, is a substantial departure from natural levels and is unequivocally responsible for the majority of recent global warming. The accompanying claim about Europe's emissions is also factually incorrect.;1.  What is the claim being assessed?    The central claim being assessed is that human influence on the climate is negligible because man-made CO2 constitutes a vanishingly small fraction (specifically, 0.0016%) of the total CO2 concentration (0.04%) in the atmosphere. This claim implies that human CO2 emissions have no significant impact on climate change. A secondary claim states that Europe contributes 16% of total human-caused CO2 emissions.2.  What is the verdict (true;False: Claim that Human CO2 Emissions are Too Small to Impact Climate Change;The Claim: A Facebook post claims that human-caused CO2 emissions are insignificant and have no impact on climate change because they constitute a very small fraction (0.0016%) of the total CO2 concentration in the atmosphere.The Evidence: Climate scientists Peter Langen, Sebastian Mernild, and Eigil Kaas provide expert testimony that even small changes in CO2 levels can significantly impact global warming. They reference data showing a significant increase in CO2 levels from pre-industrial times (280 ppm) to current levels (420 ppm), attributed to human activity. Additionally, the EU's Joint Research Center (JRC) data is cited to refute a related claim about Europe's share of global CO2 emissions.The Verdict: False. The claim is false because experts agree that even small changes in CO2 levels can have a significant impact on global warming, and the data shows a significant increase in CO2 levels due to human activity, contributing to climate change. The verdict is based on the expert testimony and scientific data, which contradict the claim that human-caused CO2 emissions are insignificant.;Here's the final verdict:1.

The evidence also includes data showing a significant increase in CO2 levels from pre-industrial times (280 ppm) to current levels (420 ppm), attributed to human activity. This increase is linked to climate change, with 1.07 degrees of the 1.09-degree temperature increase since 1850 attributed to human-made causes. The experts' consensus and scientific data contradict the claim, leading to a verdict of False.Réponse de Meta AI : Here's the final verdict: 1. What is the claim being assessed?

The experts' consensus and scientific data contradict the claim, leading to a verdict of False.;Claim That Human CO2 Emissions Are Insignificant in Climate Change Is False, Experts Confirm;Summary of Fact-Check on Human Influence on Climate Change1. The Claim: Social media posts, particularly on Facebook, assert that human-made CO2 constitutes only 0.0016% of the total CO2 concentration in the atmosphere (0.04%), suggesting that human CO2 emissions are insignificant and have no influence on climate change. Additionally, the posts claim that Europe contributes 16% of global human-caused CO2 emissions.2. The Evidence:- CO2 Concentration and Impact: Experts, including Peter Langen (Aarhus University), Sebastian Mernild (University of Southern Denmark), and Eigil Kaas (DMI), confirm that atmospheric CO2 is about 0.04% (420 ppm). Pre-industrial levels were 280 ppm, with natural fluctuations between 180 ppm (ice ages) and 280 ppm (interglacial periods). Human activity has increased CO2 to 420 ppm, significantly beyond the natural range, driving global warming. The IPCC attributes 1.07°C of the 1.09°C temperature rise since 1850 to human causes, primarily CO2 emissions.- Human Contribution: Eigil Kaas states that the increase in atmospheric CO2 from 280 ppm to 425 ppm since the mid-19th century is almost entirely human-driven, creating a climate system imbalance.- Europe’s CO2 Emissions: The EU’s Joint Research Centre (JRC) reports that EU member states accounted for 6.4% of global CO2 emissions in 2023, not 16% as claimed.3. The Verdict: The claim is false. The assertion that human-made CO2 is insignificant due to its small fraction is misleading, even small increases in CO2 concentration significantly impact global temperatures, as evidenced by the rise from 280 ppm to 420 ppm and the associated 1.07°C warming. The claim about Europe’s 16% share of global emissions is also incorrect, as the EU’s contribution is 6.4%. The evidence from climate researchers and authoritative sources like the IPCC and JRC clearly refutes the claims, confirming the significant role of human CO2 emissions in climate change.;1. The Claim Being Assessed: The fact-check evaluates two primary claims from social media posts, particularly on Facebook:- Human-made CO2 constitutes only 0.0016% of the total CO2 concentration in the atmosphere (0.04%), implying that human CO2 emissions are insignificant and have no influence on climate change.- Europe contributes 16% of total global human-caused CO2 emissions.2. The Verdict: The claims are false.3. Reasoning and Evidence Supporting the Verdict:- CO2 Significance: Experts, including Peter Langen (Aarhus University), Sebastian Mernild (University of Southern Denmark), and Eigil Kaas (DMI), confirm that atmospheric CO2 is approximately 0.04% (420 ppm). Pre-industrial levels were around 280 ppm, with natural fluctuations between 180 ppm (ice ages) and 280 ppm (interglacial periods). Human activities have increased CO2 levels to 420 ppm, well beyond the natural range. This increase is responsible for nearly all of the 1.07°C temperature rise since 1850, as per the IPCC, demonstrating that even small changes in CO2 concentration significantly impact global warming. The claim that human-made CO2 is insignificant is misleading, as the rise from 280 ppm to 425 ppm is almost entirely human-driven, creating a climate system imbalance.- Europe’s CO2 Emissions: The EU’s Joint Research Centre (JRC) reports that EU member states contributed 6.4% of global CO2 emissions in 2023, not 16% as claimed in the posts. This discrepancy further undermines the credibility of the social media assertions.The evidence from climate researchers and authoritative sources like the IPCC and JRC clearly refutes both claims, confirming that human CO2 emissions significantly influence climate change and that the stated European contribution is overstated.

And there is no doubt that human interference plays a significant role, say researchers. Photo: NOAA;Least-to-most ;Claim That Human CO? Emissions Are Too Small to Impact Climate Is False, Experts Say;The claim that human-made CO? emissions are too small to influence the climate is false. Although human-generated CO? may appear numerically small when compared to the total volume of the atmosphere, this framing is misleading. Scientists explain that CO? has a strong impact on global temperatures even in small concentrations, and human activity has caused CO? levels to rise from around 280 ppm to over 420 ppm—well outside natural historical ranges. This increase is the primary driver of the observed global warming. Furthermore, contrary to Facebook claims, Europe contributes about 6.4% of global CO? emissions—not 16%. Therefore, the claim that man-made CO? is insignificant in the “big picture” is not supported by the scientific evidence.;1. What is the claim being evaluated?The claim is that human-caused CO? emissions are so small—a “vanishingly small fraction” of total atmospheric CO? (0.0016% of 0.04%)—that they have no significant influence on the climate.2. Based on the evidence provided, is the claim true, false, mixed or another verdict category?False3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict? Scientists confirm that even small increases in CO? can significantly impact global temperatures. Human activity has raised CO? levels from about 280 ppm (pre-industrial levels) to over 420 ppm today, a nearly 50% increase. This increase is well outside natural historical ranges (180–280 ppm) and correlates closely with rising global temperatures. The IPCC attributes most of the observed warming since 1850 to human-made emissions. Experts emphasize that it’s the change in CO? levels, not their proportion in the atmosphere, that drives climate effects.---Final Verdict:The claim that human-caused CO? emissions are too small to affect the climate is false. Scientific evidence shows that the increase in CO? concentrations due to human activity is both significant and a major driver of global warming. The argument based on the small percentage of CO? in the atmosphere misrepresents how climate science works.;Fact Check: No, Vanishingly Small Human CO2 Emissions Don't Mean No Climate Impact, Europe's Share is Lower Than Claimed;The claim that human-made CO2 has no influence on climate change because it constitutes a vanishingly small fraction of total atmospheric CO2 is false. While CO2 makes up a small percentage of the atmosphere (0.04%), the evidence strongly indicates that human activities have significantly increased its concentration beyond natural levels. Before human influence, CO2 levels were between 0.02% and 0.03%, but have risen to 0.04% due to human emissions. In terms of parts per million (ppm), natural fluctuations historically ranged from 180 ppm to 280 ppm, whereas current levels are around 420 ppm, a dramatic increase attributed to human activity. Experts confirm that almost the entire increase in atmospheric CO2 since the mid-19th century is man-made, leading to an imbalance in the climate system and contributing significantly to global warming. The UN's climate panel, IPCC, attributes 1.07 degrees Celsius of the 1.09 degrees increase in average global temperature since 1850 directly to human causes. Additionally, the claim that Europe contributes 16% of global human-caused CO2 emissions is inaccurate, the figure for 2023 was 6.4%.;1.  What is the claim being evaluated? The claim being evaluated is that human-made CO2 constitutes such a vanishingly small fraction (0.0016 percent) of the total CO2 concentration in the atmosphere (0.04 percent) that it has absolutely no influence on the climate, and that Europe's share of total human-caused CO2 emissions is 16 percent.2.  Based on the evidence provided, is the claim true, false, mixed or another verdict category? False.3.  What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict?     While 0.04% of the atmosphere is CO2, the crucial point is the change in concentration caused by human activities. Pre-industrial CO2 levels were 0.02-0.03%, meaning human activity has caused a significant increase to 0.04%.     Using parts per million (ppm) provides a clearer picture: natural fluctuations historically ranged from 180 ppm during ice ages to 280 ppm during interglacial periods. Current CO2 levels are at 420 ppm, far exceeding natural variations, and this increase is directly attributed to human actions.     Experts state that almost the entire increase in atmospheric CO2 since the mid-19th century is human-made, creating an imbalance in the climate system.     The UN's climate panel, IPCC, attributes 1.07 degrees Celsius of the 1.09 degrees increase in average global temperature since 1850 to human-made causes, directly linking human CO2 emissions to climate change.     The claim that Europe contributes 16% of total human-caused CO2 emissions is also false, the correct figure for EU member states in 2023 was 6.4%.Final Verdict: The claim that human-made CO2 has no influence on the climate due to its small percentage of total atmospheric CO2, and that Europe contributes 16% of global human-caused CO2 emissions, is false. Evidence shows that even a small percentage increase in CO2 concentration due to human activity has a significant impact on global temperatures, with current CO2 levels far exceeding natural variations and directly attributable to human influence. The figure for Europe's contribution to global CO2 emissions is also considerably lower than stated.;Claim That Human CO2 Emissions Have 'No Influence' on Climate Change Is False;The claim that man-made CO2 has no influence on climate change due to its small concentration in the atmosphere is false. The evidence from climate experts Peter Langen, Sebastian Mernild, and Eigil Kaas shows that even small changes in CO2 levels can significantly impact global warming. The increase in CO2 concentration from 280 ppm to 420 ppm, far beyond the natural range, is attributed to human activities and has contributed to the temperature increase since 1850. According to the IPCC, human-made causes account for 1.07 degrees of the 1.09-degree temperature rise. This evidence contradicts the claim that man-made CO2 emissions are insignificant, leading to a verdict of false. Additionally, the fact-check also highlights an error in another claim that Europe contributes 16% of total human-caused CO2 emissions, when in fact the correct figure is 6.4% according to the Joint Research Center.;Here are the brief answers to each question:What is the claim being evaluated?The claim being evaluated is that man-made CO2 constitutes a vanishingly small fraction of the total CO2 concentration in the atmosphere and therefore has no influence on climate change.Based on the evidence provided, is the claim true, false, mixed or another verdict category?False.What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict?The evidence that supports this verdict includes expert opinions from professors Peter Langen, Sebastian Mernild, and Eigil Kaas, who all agree that even small changes in CO2 levels can have a significant impact on global warming.

This demonstrates that even small CO2 increases significantly impact global warming. Additionally, the EU’s Joint Research Centre reports that EU emissions were 6.4% of the global total in 2023, not 16% as claimed. Based on this evidence, the claims are false, as human CO2 emissions substantially influence climate change, and the stated European contribution is overstated.;1.

Emissions Are Too Small to Affect Climate Is False, Scientists Confirm;The Claim:The claim being evaluated is that human-caused CO? emissions are so small—just 0.0016% of the atmosphere—that they cannot have any significant impact on the climate.2. The Evidence:Scientists agree that while CO? makes up a small fraction of the atmosphere (about 0.04%), even slight increases in its concentration can significantly influence global temperatures. Before industrialization, CO? levels were around 280 parts per million (ppm), today, they have risen to over 420 ppm, largely due to human activity. This sharp increase is well beyond natural historical ranges and has been closely linked to global warming. Leading climate researchers and the UN’s climate panel (IPCC) confirm that most of the observed warming since 1850 is due to human-caused emissions. Additionally, the argument that Europe's CO? contribution is 16% is also incorrect—the actual figure is around 6.4% as of 2023.3. The Verdict:False.The claim misrepresents how atmospheric CO? affects the climate. Experts emphasize that it’s not the tiny proportion of human-caused CO? that matters, but the significant increase it has caused in overall CO? levels—an increase that plays a major role in global warming.;1. What is the claim being assessed?The claim is that human-caused CO? emissions are too small—only 0.0016% of the atmosphere—to have any meaningful impact on the climate.2. What is the final verdict?False3. Explanation:The claim is misleading because it focuses on the proportion of CO? in the atmosphere rather than the effect of changes in its concentration. Scientists confirm that even small increases in atmospheric CO? can significantly affect the climate. Human activities have raised CO? levels from about 280 parts per million (ppm) before industrialization to over 420 ppm today—an increase far beyond natural variations. This rise is the primary driver of global warming, as confirmed by multiple scientific sources, including the IPCC. Therefore, the small percentage of CO? does not mean it has a small effect, the increase caused by humans is substantial and highly impactful.;Fact Check: Human CO2 Impact on Climate is Significant, Not Vanishingly Small;The claim evaluated is that human-made CO2 constitutes such a minuscule fraction (0.0016%) of the total atmospheric CO2 (0.04%) that it has no influence on climate change, and that Europe is responsible for 16% of total human-caused CO2 emissions.However, evidence strongly refutes these assertions. While 0.04% might seem small, human activities have increased atmospheric CO2 from a pre-industrial range of 0.02-0.03% to its current level. More critically, when measured in parts per million (ppm), CO2 levels have surged from a natural range of 180-280 ppm to 420 ppm, a rise unequivocally linked to human interference. Experts confirm that almost the entire increase in CO2 concentration since the mid-19th century is human-made, creating an imbalance in the climate system. The UN's climate panel, IPCC, attributes 1.07 degrees Celsius of the 1.09-degree global temperature increase since 1850 directly to human causes. Furthermore, the claim about Europe's CO2 contribution is also incorrect, EU member states accounted for 6.4% of global CO2 emissions in 2023, not 16%.Verdict: False. The evidence clearly demonstrates that human-made CO2 has a significant and measurable impact on climate change, even with its seemingly small percentage, due to the substantial increase it represents above natural levels. The figures cited for Europe's emissions are also inaccurate.;1.  What is the claim being assessed? The claim being assessed is that human-made CO2 constitutes such a vanishingly small fraction of the total CO2 concentration in the atmosphere (0.0016 percent of 0.04 percent) that it has no influence on climate change, and that Europe contributes 16 percent of total human-caused CO2 emissions.2.  What is the final verdict (true, false, mixed, another relevant verdict category)? False.3.  Explain how the evidence supports the verdict in a clear and concise manner. The evidence clearly refutes the claim that human-made CO2 is insignificant. While CO2 is a small percentage of the atmosphere, the crucial factor is the change caused by human activities. Human emissions have increased atmospheric CO2 from 0.02-0.03% to 0.04%. More tellingly, in parts per million (ppm), CO2 levels have risen from a natural fluctuation of 180-280 ppm to an unprecedented 420 ppm, a change almost entirely attributable to human activity since the mid-19th century. This significant increase in concentration, not the absolute percentage, creates an imbalance in the climate system. The IPCC confirms that 1.07 of the 1.09 degrees Celsius global temperature rise since 1850 is due to human-made causes, directly linking human CO2 to climate change. Furthermore, the claim about Europe's CO2 contribution is factually incorrect, with the actual figure being 6.4% in 2023, not 16%. Therefore, the evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that human CO2 emissions have a profound and measurable influence on the climate.;No, Claim That Human CO2 Emissions Have 'No Influence' on Climate Change Is False;Claim: A Facebook post claims that man-made CO2 constitutes a vanishingly small fraction of the total CO2 concentration in the atmosphere and therefore has no influence on climate change.Evidence: Climate experts Peter Langen, Sebastian Mernild, and Eigil Kaas provided evidence that even small changes in CO2 levels can significantly impact global warming. They noted that human activities have increased CO2 concentration from 280 ppm to 420 ppm, far beyond the natural range. The IPCC's assessment that human-made causes account for 1.07 degrees of the 1.09-degree temperature rise since 1850 further supports the significance of human CO2 emissions.Verdict: FALSE. The evidence shows that despite CO2's relatively small concentration in the atmosphere, human-caused emissions have significantly contributed to the increase in global temperatures, contradicting the claim that man-made CO2 has no influence on climate change.;Here's the verdict:Claim: The claim being assessed is that man-made CO2 constitutes a vanishingly small fraction of the total CO2 concentration in the atmosphere and therefore has no influence on climate change.Verdict: FALSEExplanation: The evidence provided by climate experts Peter Langen, Sebastian Mernild, and Eigil Kaas shows that even small changes in CO2 levels can have a significant impact on global warming. The data on CO2 concentration levels, which have risen from 280 ppm to 420 ppm due to human activities, far exceeding natural ranges, further supports this. Additionally, the IPCC's assessment that human-made causes account for the majority of the temperature increase since 1850 confirms the significant role of human CO2 emissions in climate change. This evidence directly contradicts the claim that man-made CO2 has no influence on climate change, making the claim false.Réponse de Meta AI : Here's the verdict: Claim: The claim being assessed is that man-made CO2 constitutes a vanishingly small fraction of the total CO2 concentration in the atmosphere and therefore has no influence on climate change.

This evidence directly contradicts the claim that man-made CO2 has no influence on climate change, making the claim false.;False: Human CO2 Emissions Significantly Impact Climate, and Europe’s Share Is 6.4%, Not 16%;Claim: Social media posts, primarily on Facebook, claim that human-made CO2, at 0.0016% of the atmosphere’s 0.04% CO2 concentration, is too insignificant to influence climate change, and that Europe contributes 16% of global human-caused CO2 emissions.Evidence: Experts, including Peter Langen, Sebastian Mernild, and Eigil Kaas, confirm that atmospheric CO2 has risen from a pre-industrial 280 ppm to 420 ppm, with human activity driving nearly all of this increase, contributing to 1.07°C of the 1.09°C global temperature rise since 1850, according to the IPCC. This shows that even small CO2 increases significantly impact global warming. The EU’s Joint Research Centre (JRC) reports that EU emissions were 6.4% of the global total in 2023, not 16% as claimed.Verdict: The claim is false. The evidence demonstrates that human-driven CO2 increases have a substantial effect on climate change, contradicting the claim of insignificance. Additionally, the EU’s actual CO2 contribution is far lower than the claimed 16%, confirming the inaccuracy of both assertions.;1. Claim Being Assessed: Social media posts, primarily on Facebook, claim that human-made CO2, constituting 0.0016% of the atmosphere’s 0.04% CO2 concentration, is insignificant and has no influence on climate change. Additionally, they assert that Europe contributes 16% of global human-caused CO2 emissions.2. Final Verdict: The claim is false.3. How the Evidence Supports the Verdict:The evidence clearly refutes both parts of the claim. Experts, including Peter Langen, Sebastian Mernild, and Eigil Kaas, confirm that atmospheric CO2 has increased from a pre-industrial 280 ppm to 420 ppm, with human activity responsible for nearly all of this rise, driving 1.07°C of the 1.09°C global temperature increase since 1850, as reported by the IPCC. This demonstrates that human CO2 emissions significantly impact climate change, contradicting the claim of insignificance. Furthermore, the EU’s Joint Research Centre (JRC) states that EU emissions accounted for 6.4% of global CO2 in 2023, not 16% as claimed. These findings show both assertions are incorrect, supporting the false verdict.
FC_07;Bullet point summary;Posts about anthropogenic CO2 in the atmosphere use partially correct figures to draw completely wrong conclusions;Man-made CO2 constitutes such a tiny fraction of the atmosphere that it has absolutely no impact on climate change. This is what several Facebook posts say, where CO2's share of the atmosphere is stated to be only 0.04 percent and humans' contribution to only 0.0016 percent of the total CO2 concentration. The numbers in the posts are partially correct. But the conclusion is not, researchers tell TjekDet.;This is the fact-check: How can one ever believe that humans have any influence on the climate in the big picture, when man-made CO2 only constitutes a “vanishingly small fraction” of 0.0016 percent of the total CO2 concentration in the atmosphere of 0.04 percent?This is what is stated in numerous Facebook posts , where the claim is used to downplay the role of humans in climate change. The conclusion in the posts is that the man-made CO 2 in the atmosphere has absolutely no influence.Along with the claims, a graph is shared that supposedly illustrates the composition of the gases that make up the atmosphere. Here, human-caused CO2 emissions - the tiny white dot in the right corner - are compared with the total CO2 concentration - the green dots - in the Earth's atmosphere.ZeroPhoto: Screenshot of Facebook postBut neither the graph nor the numbers are proof that humans' spread of CO 2 in the atmosphere is insignificant. Because even a small change in the amount of CO 2  has an impact on global warming, shows a previous fact check from TjekDet , which includes some of the same claims.CO2 emissions in the big picturePeter Langen , a professor at the Department of Environmental Science at Aarhus University, told TjekDet last year that it is correct that 0.04 percent of the air molecules in the atmosphere are CO2 molecules . But even though the percentage may seem quite small, its significance cannot be ignored. Before we humans started changing things, there was between 0.02 and 0.03 percent CO 2 in the atmosphere. We humans have caused the concentration to increase to 0.04 percent. And this change has contributed greatly to the increase in temperature on Earth, Peter Langen explained to TjekDet.He has previously come across the figure 0.04 percent, where it is used as an argument that human CO2 emissions have no significance in the big picture. So is Sebastian Mernild , who is professor and head of the SDU Climate Cluster at the University of Southern Denmark.He explained to TjekDet that a different unit of measurement is typically used, namely parts per million (ppm), which refers to the concentration of - in this case - CO2 molecules per million molecules in the air. And according to Sebastian Mernild, it will typically fluctuate naturally between 180 ppm when we have an ice age, and 280 ppm when we have an interglacial period , which we have now.CheckedThe rise in CO2 in the atmosphere has caused temperatures to rise. And there is no doubt that human interference plays a significant role, say researchers. Photo: NOAA;Zero-shot; Claim That Human CO? Emissions Are Too Small to Affect Climate Is False;Claim:The claim being evaluated is that human-caused CO? emissions are too small—just 0.0016% of the atmosphere—to have any meaningful impact on the climate.Evidence:Scientific experts explain that while CO? is a small component of the atmosphere (about 0.04%), even minor increases in its concentration have a major effect on global temperatures. Human activity has raised atmospheric CO? from pre-industrial levels of about 280 parts per million (ppm) to over 420 ppm today—well beyond natural historical levels. This increase is closely linked to the rise in global temperatures and is almost entirely due to human actions. Climate scientists and international bodies like the IPCC confirm that human-caused CO? emissions are the main driver of recent global warming. Additionally, claims about Europe contributing 16% of global CO? emissions are also incorrect, the actual figure is around 6.4%.Verdict:False.The claim misrepresents how CO? influences climate change. The significant rise in CO? levels due to human activity has a proven and substantial impact on the Earth's climate.;1. What is the claim being evaluated?The claim is that human-caused CO? emissions are too small—only 0.0016% of the atmosphere—to have any significant impact on the climate.2. Is the claim true, false, or mixed or other relevant category of verdict?False3. Explanation:The claim is based on a misleading use of percentages. While CO? makes up a small portion of the atmosphere, even small increases in its concentration can have a large effect on global temperatures. Scientific evidence shows that human activity has increased CO? levels from about 280 parts per million (ppm) to over 420 ppm—well beyond natural fluctuations. This increase is the main driver of recent climate change, as confirmed by climate experts and the IPCC. Therefore, the claim that human-caused CO? emissions are too small to matter is scientifically inaccurate.;Fact Check: Human CO2's Climate Impact Not Vanishingly Small, Europe's Contribution Overstated;The claim evaluated is that human-made CO2 constitutes such a vanishingly small fraction (0.0016%) of the total atmospheric CO2 (0.04%) that it has no influence on climate change, and that Europe contributes 16% of total human-caused CO2 emissions.However, the evidence refutes these assertions. While 0.04% of the atmosphere is indeed CO2, human activities have significantly increased its concentration from a pre-industrial 0.02-0.03%. Experts emphasize using parts per million (ppm), noting that CO2 levels have risen from a natural range of 180-280 ppm to an unprecedented 420 ppm due to human interference. This substantial increase, not the total percentage, is critical for climate impact. Scientists state that nearly the entire increase in atmospheric CO2 since the mid-19th century is human-made, creating an imbalance. The IPCC attributes 1.07 degrees Celsius of the 1.09-degree global temperature increase since 1850 directly to human causes. Additionally, Europe's share of global human-caused CO2 emissions was 6.4% in 2023, not 16%.Verdict: False. The evidence clearly demonstrates that human-made CO2 has a significant and measurable impact on climate change, and the figures cited for Europe's emissions are incorrect.;1.  What is the claim being evaluated? The claim being evaluated is that human-made CO2 constitutes such a vanishingly small fraction of the total CO2 concentration in the atmosphere (0.0016 percent of 0.04 percent) that it has absolutely no influence on the climate, and that Europe contributes 16 percent of total human-caused CO2 emissions.2.  Is the claim true, false, or mixed or other relevant category of verdict? False.3.  Provide a brief explanation for your decision based on the evidence presented in the fact-check. The evidence overwhelmingly refutes the claim. While CO2 is a small percentage of the atmosphere, human activities have caused a significant increase in its concentration from pre-industrial levels (e.g., from 280 ppm to 420 ppm), which is directly linked to rising global temperatures. Experts confirm that almost the entire increase in CO2 since the mid-19th century is human-made and that this change has a profound impact on the climate system. The IPCC attributes the vast majority of recent global warming to human causes. Furthermore, the stated figure for Europe's CO2 contribution is significantly higher than the actual 6.4%.;Claim That Human CO2 Emissions Have No Impact on Climate Change Is False;The claim being evaluated is that human CO2 emissions have no influence on climate change due to their small concentration in the atmosphere.The key evidence used to assess the claim includes expert opinions from climate scientists Peter Langen, Sebastian Mernild, and Eigil Kaas, who stated that even small changes in CO2 levels can significantly impact global warming. They also highlighted that human activities have increased CO2 concentrations from 280 ppm to 420 ppm, far beyond natural ranges. Additionally, the IPCC's assessment that human-made causes account for the majority of the temperature increase since 1850 was cited.The verdict is FALSE. Based on the evidence, human CO2 emissions do have a significant influence on climate change, contradicting the claim that they have no impact.;Here's the verdict:Claim: The claim being evaluated is that human CO2 emissions have no influence on climate change because they constitute a vanishingly small fraction of the total CO2 concentration in the atmosphere.Verdict: FALSEExplanation: The claim is false because the evidence shows that even small changes in CO2 levels can have a significant impact on global warming. The increase in CO2 concentration from 280 ppm to 420 ppm due to human activities, which is far beyond natural ranges, and the IPCC's assessment that human-made causes account for the majority of the temperature increase since 1850, directly contradict the claim that human CO2 emissions have no influence on climate change.Réponse de Meta AI : Here's the verdict: Claim: The claim being evaluated is that human CO2 emissions have no influence on climate change because they constitute a vanishingly small fraction of the total CO2 concentration in the atmosphere.

Additionally, they claim Europe contributes 16% of global human-caused CO2 emissions.Key Evidence:1. CO2 Concentration and Impact: Experts confirm atmospheric CO2 is 0.04% (420 ppm), up from a pre-industrial 0.02-0.03% (180-280 ppm). This increase, largely human-driven, significantly contributes to global warming, raising temperatures by ~1.07°C since 1850, per the IPCC.2. Human Contribution: The rise from 280 ppm to 425 ppm is almost entirely due to human activities, creating a climate system imbalance.3. Europe’s Emissions: The EU’s share of global CO2 emissions in 2023 was 6.4%, not 16% as claimed, according to the EU’s Joint Research Centre.Verdict: False. The claim underestimates the significant impact of human-driven CO2 increases on climate change and overstates Europe’s share of global emissions.;1. Claim Being Evaluated: Social media posts claim that human-made CO2 constitutes only 0.0016% of the total CO2 in the atmosphere (0.04%), suggesting it has no significant impact on climate change. Additionally, they claim Europe contributes 16% of global human-caused CO2 emissions.2. Verdict: False.3. Explanation: The claim misrepresents the impact of human-made CO2, which has increased atmospheric CO2 from 280 ppm to 425 ppm, driving a ~1.07°C temperature rise since 1850, per IPCC findings. This significant human-driven increase contradicts the claim of negligible impact. Additionally, the EU’s share of global CO2 emissions is 6.4% (2023, EU Joint Research Centre), not 16% as claimed, further disproving the posts.

But they are deepfakes made by scammers to sell a fake drug.;This is the fact-check : The Source Criticism Agency has previously noted that Lars Wallentin, a senior professor of cardiology in Uppsala, was exploited in a hoax video in which he allegedly made revelations about the Covid-19 vaccine. – Total fake, completely out of touch with reality, the real Lars Wallentin commented on the video in May. That video has since been taken down, but another video is also being spread in which Wallentin is alleged to have been murdered, shot in his car. From deepfake hoax video on Facebook April 22. The new video has been viewed nearly 9,000 times so far, according to Facebook's counter.The fraudsters behind the videos have used AI to make it look like real people are acting in front of the camera, so-called deepfakes .

The Source Criticism Agency has contacted Sandström.The claims in the videoIn addition to the fact that the fraudsters AI-generated Lars Wallentin and Mikael Sandström, the claims made about cardiovascular diseases themselves are false, according to doctors that Källkritikbyrån spoke to. Taking a tablet to clear the vessels is physiologically a very stupid idea, states Jakob Johansson, chief physician at the healthcare company Aleris. – Hypothetically, if this agent were to cause these plaques, which are a coating on the vessel wall, to loosen, it would lead to a lot of clots going all over the body. But if they mean that this would clear it up so that it just magically disappears, well, then it would be useful. Are there any such pills that “clear the vessels”?– No, that sounds completely unlikely. There is a huge amount of research done on atherosclerosis and there is good treatment for it, but no single “magic bullet” that solves everything, in this way, says Jakob Johansson at Aleris. The Facebook page has been blocked from posting ads. The video claims that the miracle cure would start working after three days. – Sure, an Alvdeon starts working after twenty minutes, but that this would have an effect on something as complex as atherosclerosis is, in my opinion, completely impossible. This is what the voice in the video says:Everyone has it. Stroke, heart attack, paralysis. It's just a matter of time.From deepfake hoax video on Facebook April 22. – No, not everyone is affected by it. It is common in many cultures to get atherosclerosis to a greater or lesser degree, but it does not cause symptoms such as a heart attack or stroke in the majority, no. From Facebook's ad library. The video claims that by the age of 50, the blood vessels are already damaged. How accurate is that?– No, of course that's not true. The vascular tree is exposed to stress, but the majority of the population is not affected, especially not with an impact on circulation. What do you think about this kind of claim being spread like this?– As with all forms of quackery, it's sad because it can lead to people not taking the medical treatment and making the lifestyle changes that we know can reduce atherosclerosis. So it's sad if just one person goes through this, says Johansson.How the films are distributedThe video is still up on Facebook at the time of writing.

The Source Criticism Agency has contacted Sandström.The claims in the videoIn addition to the fact that the fraudsters AI-generated Lars Wallentin and Mikael Sandström, the claims made about cardiovascular diseases themselves are false, according to doctors that Källkritikbyrån spoke to. Taking a tablet to clear the vessels is physiologically a very stupid idea, states Jakob Johansson, chief physician at the healthcare company Aleris. – Hypothetically, if this agent were to cause these plaques, which are a coating on the vessel wall, to loosen, it would lead to a lot of clots going all over the body. But if they mean that this would clear it up so that it just magically disappears, well, then it would be useful. Are there any such pills that “clear the vessels”?– No, that sounds completely unlikely. There is a huge amount of research done on atherosclerosis and there is good treatment for it, but no single “magic bullet” that solves everything, in this way, says Jakob Johansson at Aleris. The Facebook page has been blocked from posting ads. The video claims that the miracle cure would start working after three days. – Sure, an Alvdeon starts working after twenty minutes, but that this would have an effect on something as complex as atherosclerosis is, in my opinion, completely impossible.

It's just a matter of time.From deepfake hoax video on Facebook April 22. – No, not everyone is affected by it. It is common in many cultures to get atherosclerosis to a greater or lesser degree, but it does not cause symptoms such as a heart attack or stroke in the majority, no. From Facebook's ad library. The video claims that by the age of 50, the blood vessels are already damaged. How accurate is that?– No, of course that's not true. The vascular tree is exposed to stress, but the majority of the population is not affected, especially not with an impact on circulation. What do you think about this kind of claim being spread like this?– As with all forms of quackery, it's sad because it can lead to people not taking the medical treatment and making the lifestyle changes that we know can reduce atherosclerosis. So it's sad if just one person goes through this, says Johansson.How the films are distributedThe video is still up on Facebook at the time of writing. The account spreading the video has posted 45 ads since March, all of which have been taken down for violating Meta’s rules. The page also appears to have been blocked from posting ads.

What is the claim being verified?The claim being verified is that Swedish cardiologist Lars Wallentin was murdered, shot in his car, and that he, along with TV personality Mikael Sandström, revealed shocking information about the healthcare system or developed miracle cures (a pill to clean the vessels and a cream for joint pain). These revelations and products are presented as having been suppressed by a pharmaceutical mafia.2. What is the final verdict?False3.

The assertions that everyone will experience stroke, heart attack, or paralysis, and that blood vessels are already damaged by age 50, are also dismissed as untrue.

The Source Criticism Agency, supported by statements from Wallentin himself and medical expert Jakob Johansson from Aleris, confirms these videos are AI-generated hoaxes that misrepresent real individuals and promote fraudulent health products like “Frank & Frey CBD Capsules.” The claims are entirely false, as no evidence supports the depicted events, and the touted remedies lack any scientific basis, exploiting the doctors’ identities to deceive viewers.;Verdict Determination for the Fact-Check1. Claim Being Evaluated:    The claim, spread through deepfake videos on Facebook, asserts that Swedish cardiologist Lars Wallentin was shot dead in his car and TV doctor Mikael Sandström had his apartment burned down by the “pharmaceutical mafia” for revealing “miracle cures.” These cures, including “Frank & Frey CBD Capsules” and a cream, are claimed to treat cardiovascular diseases, joint pain, and other health issues like headaches, fatigue, and varicose veins.2.

The Source Criticism Agency has contacted Sandström.The claims in the videoIn addition to the fact that the fraudsters AI-generated Lars Wallentin and Mikael Sandström, the claims made about cardiovascular diseases themselves are false, according to doctors that Källkritikbyrån spoke to. Taking a tablet to clear the vessels is physiologically a very stupid idea, states Jakob Johansson, chief physician at the healthcare company Aleris. – Hypothetically, if this agent were to cause these plaques, which are a coating on the vessel wall, to loosen, it would lead to a lot of clots going all over the body. But if they mean that this would clear it up so that it just magically disappears, well, then it would be useful. Are there any such pills that “clear the vessels”?– No, that sounds completely unlikely. There is a huge amount of research done on atherosclerosis and there is good treatment for it, but no single “magic bullet” that solves everything, in this way, says Jakob Johansson at Aleris. The Facebook page has been blocked from posting ads. The video claims that the miracle cure would start working after three days. – Sure, an Alvdeon starts working after twenty minutes, but that this would have an effect on something as complex as atherosclerosis is, in my opinion, completely impossible.

The video claims that by the age of 50, the blood vessels are already damaged. How accurate is that?– No, of course that's not true. The vascular tree is exposed to stress, but the majority of the population is not affected, especially not with an impact on circulation. What do you think about this kind of claim being spread like this?– As with all forms of quackery, it's sad because it can lead to people not taking the medical treatment and making the lifestyle changes that we know can reduce atherosclerosis. So it's sad if just one person goes through this, says Johansson.How the films are distributedThe video is still up on Facebook at the time of writing. The account spreading the video has posted 45 ads since March, all of which have been taken down for violating Meta’s rules. The page also appears to have been blocked from posting ads.

The claims about the remedy that the scammers are trying to sell are false – it is a scam. ;Contextual;False: Viral Video Claiming Cardiologist Lars Wallentin Was Murdered Over Miracle Pill Is a Deepfake Scam;A viral video circulating on Facebook claims that Swedish cardiologist Lars Wallentin was murdered in Stockholm after revealing a groundbreaking pill that cleans blood vessels and cures various ailments. The video mimics an SVT news broadcast and features AI-generated versions of Wallentin and news anchor Lisbeth Åkerman. However, Wallentin is alive and has publicly denounced the video as fake. Experts confirm that the video uses deepfake technology and promotes scientifically unfounded health claims. Verdict: False. The video is a fabricated hoax designed to mislead viewers and market a fraudulent product.;1. What is the claim being assessed?That Swedish cardiologist Lars Wallentin was assassinated after revealing a revolutionary pill that cleans blood vessels and cures various health issues, as reported in an SVT news broadcast featuring anchor Lisbeth Åkerman.2. What is the verdict?False3. What reasoning or evidence supports this decision? Lars Wallentin is alive and has publicly denied the video’s claims, stating it is a complete fabrication. The video is made using deepfake AI technology to impersonate both Wallentin and SVT anchor Lisbeth Åkerman. SVT never aired the broadcast shown in the video, and the content is not based on any real reporting. Medical experts have debunked the health claims, stating that no pill exists that can clean blood vessels as described. The video is linked to online scams promoting fraudulent health products and has been spread through accounts previously flagged for violations on Facebook.These points clearly show that the video is entirely fabricated, both in terms of the event and the medical claims, justifying a verdict of False.;AI Deepfake Hoax Falsely Claims Cardiologist Murdered, Promotes Fake Miracle Cures for Ailments;An emerging wave of AI-generated deepfake videos circulating on Facebook falsely claims the murder of senior cardiologist Lars Wallentin and promotes a miracle pill for clearing blood vessels, alongside similar deceptive content exploiting TV doctor Mikael Sandström to advertise a joint-healing cream. Evidence, including direct denials from Wallentin and Sandström, confirmation from the Source Criticism Agency that the videos are AI-fabricated hoaxes, and expert medical opinion from chief physician Jakob Johansson, unequivocally refutes these claims, branding the medical assertions as physiologically impossible and the entire scheme as a scam. Therefore, the claim is false, as the events depicted are fabrications designed to sell unproven health supplements.;1.  What is the claim being assessed?    The claims being assessed are that:     Senior cardiologist Lars Wallentin was murdered, shot in his car, after revealing shocking information about the Swedish healthcare system.     Lars Wallentin created a miracle pill that can clean the vessels and prevent various health problems, including premature death, headaches, fatigue, swelling, and varicose veins.     TV personality and doctor Mikael Sandström had his apartment burned down by the pharmaceutical mafia as an attempt to silence him regarding a new unique cream formula that can instantly relieve inflammation and completely restore joints and cartilage.     These purported miracle cures (the pill and the cream) are legitimate and effective treatments for cardiovascular diseases and joint issues.     Atherosclerosis affects everyone, inevitably leading to stroke, heart attack, or paralysis, and that by age 50, blood vessels are already damaged.2.  What is the verdict?    False3.  What reasoning or evidence supports this decision?    The verdict of False is supported by overwhelming evidence presented in the fact-check:     AI-Generated Hoax: The videos are explicitly identified as deepfakes created using Artificial Intelligence (AI). This means the purported news reports, interviews with the doctors, and their statements are not real but digitally fabricated.     Direct Denials and Confirmation of Life: Lars Wallentin himself publicly stated that a previous, similar video was Total fake, completely out of touch with reality. The Source Criticism Agency also directly contacted Lars Wallentin after his alleged murder in the video, confirming he is alive and well, thereby debunking the murder claim. Mikael Sandström has also spoken out against being exploited by scammers in his name, expressing his distress.     Expert Medical Rebuttal: Chief physician Jakob Johansson from Aleris definitively refutes the medical claims made in the videos. He calls the idea of a tablet clearing vessels physiologically a very stupid idea and completely unlikely, explaining it could lead to dangerous clots rather than a cure. He confirms there is no single 'magic bullet' for atherosclerosis and dismisses the notion that such a cure would work in days. He also debunks the claims that atherosclerosis affects everyone or that blood vessels are necessarily damaged by age 50 in the majority of the population.     Scam for Product Sales: The underlying purpose of these elaborate hoaxes is to funnel viewers towards purchasing unproven dietary supplements (e.g., Frank & Frey CBD Capsules), marketed with false promises of miraculous health benefits.     Platform Action: Facebook has recognized the deceptive nature of these videos, having taken down numerous ads from the account spreading the Wallentin video for violating their rules, indicating a breach of their genuine content policies.;Deepfake Video Falsely Claims Cardiologist's Murder Linked to 'Vessel-Clearing' Pill;A deepfake video circulating on Facebook claims that Swedish cardiologist Lars Wallentin was murdered after revealing information about a pill that can clean the vessels and prevent premature death. However, evidence shows that the video is fabricated, using AI-generated clones of real people, including Wallentin and SVT news anchor Lisbeth Åkerman. Doctors, including Jakob Johansson from Aleris, confirm that there is no scientific basis for the claims about the pill. Based on this evidence, the verdict is FALSE: the video is a scam with no factual basis, and its claims are entirely unfounded.;Here's the final verdict based on the fact-check:1. Claim: A video circulating on Facebook claims that Lars Wallentin, a Swedish cardiologist, was murdered after revealing shocking information about the healthcare system, and promotes a pill that can clean the vessels and prevent premature death.2. Verdict: FALSE3. Reasoning;Deepfake Videos Falsely Claim Swedish Doctors Murdered and Targeted for Fake Miracle Cure Claims;Deepfake videos on Facebook falsely claim that Swedish cardiologist Lars Wallentin was murdered and TV doctor Mikael Sandström’s apartment was bombed for revealing “miracle cures” for cardiovascular diseases and joint pain. The Source Criticism Agency, Wallentin’s own statements, and medical expert Jakob Johansson from Aleris confirm the videos are AI-generated hoaxes promoting fraudulent products like “Frank & Frey CBD Capsules,” with no evidence supporting the alleged events or the cures’ efficacy. The claims are false, as they exploit real individuals’ identities and lack any scientific or factual basis.;1. Claim Being Assessed:    The claim, propagated through deepfake videos on Facebook, asserts that Swedish cardiologist Lars Wallentin was shot dead in his car and TV doctor Mikael Sandström’s apartment was burned down by the “pharmaceutical mafia” for revealing “miracle cures” (pills and a cream) that allegedly treat cardiovascular diseases, joint pain, and other health issues such as headaches, fatigue, and varicose veins.2. Verdict:    False3. Reasoning and Evidence Supporting the Decision:   - Source Criticism Agency Confirmation: The agency verified that the videos are AI-generated deepfakes, falsely depicting Wallentin, Sandström, and SVT news anchor Lisbeth Åkerman. Wallentin himself debunked the claims, calling them “total fake” and confirming he is alive, directly refuting the murder allegation.   - Medical Expert Testimony: Jakob Johansson, chief physician at Aleris, dismissed the claims about pills or creams “clearing blood vessels” or curing complex conditions like atherosclerosis as physiologically implausible and unsupported by medical research, stating no such “magic bullet” exists.   - Fraudulent Nature of the Videos: The videos promote fake health products, such as “Frank & Frey CBD Capsules,” and direct viewers to fraudulent websites mimicking SVT. The accounts spreading these videos, including one posing as an American advertising agency, violated Meta’s rules, with 45 ads removed and the account blocked from posting ads.   - Previous Scams: Similar deepfake videos previously misused Wallentin’s identity to spread false Covid-19 vaccine claims, which he also debunked, indicating a recurring pattern of deception.   - Sandström’s Testimony: Sandström, in an Aftonbladet interview, confirmed he is frequently contacted by victims of scams using his name, denying any involvement in the claims about his apartment or the promoted cream.   - Lack of Corroborating Evidence: No credible reports or evidence support the alleged murder of Wallentin or the bombing of Sandström’s apartment, further confirming the fabricated nature of the claims.The verdict is false because the videos are AI-generated hoaxes with no factual basis, exploiting real individuals’ identities to promote fraudulent products. The absence of evidence for the alleged events, combined with expert medical refutation and the deceptive tactics of the perpetrators, conclusively debunks the claims.

What appears to be SVT news anchor Lisbeth Åkerman is seen in the video reporting on a news event.This is what the AI clone of Åkerman says:A terrible tragedy occurred in Stockholm this morning. The well-known cardiologist Lars Wallentin was shot dead in his car at a busy intersection. The police have found empty shells from a firearm. Everything indicates that it was a carefully planned attack. An eyewitness, a young woman, tearfully described how the doctor was hit by three shots and fell over the steering wheel. The day before his death, Lars Wallentin revealed shocking information about the Swedish healthcare system to our reporter – information that cost him his life. What was it about? Listen on.From deepfaked video on Facebook April 22 Then, an AI-generated copy of Lars Wallentin begins to tell us how he created a pill that can clean the vessels and prevent premature death, but also more common health problems such as headaches, fatigue, swelling and varicose veins. From deepfake hoax video on Facebook April 22. The AI clone says he has received threats, but that he “will not remain silent,” and describes the pharmaceutical industry as a “mafia.” “Lars Wallentin” says this:It's your choice. It's your pain.

The account claims to be an American advertising agency. The account on Facebook. The video refers to where you can read more, but this time there is no link.

Mikael Sandström has previously been interviewed in Aftonbladet and said in January that he was then contacted daily by elderly people who had been scammed by various online fraudsters in his name.– It is incredibly sad and I feel desperate, he told Aftonbladet . The Source Criticism Agency has contacted Sandström.The claims in the videoIn addition to the fact that the fraudsters AI-generated Lars Wallentin and Mikael Sandström, the claims made about cardiovascular diseases themselves are false, according to doctors that Källkritikbyrån spoke to. Taking a tablet to clear the vessels is physiologically a very stupid idea, states Jakob Johansson, chief physician at the healthcare company Aleris. – Hypothetically, if this agent were to cause these plaques, which are a coating on the vessel wall, to loosen, it would lead to a lot of clots going all over the body. But if they mean that this would clear it up so that it just magically disappears, well, then it would be useful. Are there any such pills that “clear the vessels”?– No, that sounds completely unlikely. There is a huge amount of research done on atherosclerosis and there is good treatment for it, but no single “magic bullet” that solves everything, in this way, says Jakob Johansson at Aleris. The Facebook page has been blocked from posting ads. The video claims that the miracle cure would start working after three days. – Sure, an Alvdeon starts working after twenty minutes, but that this would have an effect on something as complex as atherosclerosis is, in my opinion, completely impossible. This is what the voice in the video says:Everyone has it. Stroke, heart attack, paralysis. It's just a matter of time.From deepfake hoax video on Facebook April 22. – No, not everyone is affected by it. It is common in many cultures to get atherosclerosis to a greater or lesser degree, but it does not cause symptoms such as a heart attack or stroke in the majority, no. From Facebook's ad library. The video claims that by the age of 50, the blood vessels are already damaged. How accurate is that?– No, of course that's not true. The vascular tree is exposed to stress, but the majority of the population is not affected, especially not with an impact on circulation. What do you think about this kind of claim being spread like this?– As with all forms of quackery, it's sad because it can lead to people not taking the medical treatment and making the lifestyle changes that we know can reduce atherosclerosis. So it's sad if just one person goes through this, says Johansson.How the films are distributedThe video is still up on Facebook at the time of writing. The account spreading the video has posted 45 ads since March, all of which have been taken down for violating Meta’s rules. The page also appears to have been blocked from posting ads.

FC_09;Bullet point summary;False claim about the death of 14,000 infants in Gaza spread in media worldwide - including in Danish;14,000 infants in Gaza are at risk of dying from malnutrition within two days, UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher said on Tuesday. But the information is not correct, TjekDet's research shows, and the UN itself acknowledges that Tom Fletcher should have phrased it differently. However, the UN emphasizes that the situation in Gaza is critical and that thousands of children are at risk of dying from malnutrition over the next year;This is the fact-check:This was reported  in several media outlets  both at home  and abroad on Tuesday , and  politicians and  social media users are reporting the startling figure. The information about the 14,000 infants also found its way into the closing debate of the Folketing on Wednesday.The figure comes from the head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), Tom Fletcher, who appeared on  the BBC's Radio 4 Today programme on Tuesday morning , where he advocated for the need for UN trucks to be allowed to deliver emergency aid to Gaza.Let me explain what's on those trucks. It's baby food. Baby nutrition. 14,000 babies will die in the next 48 hours if we can't get to them, says Tom Fletcher on the BBC program.But it is not correct that 14,000 infants in Gaza are in acute danger of dying within 48 hours. Tom Fletcher's wording was unclear, explains Jens Lærke, spokesperson for OCHA, to TjekDet.“He should have said that 14,000 babies are very likely to suffer from severe acute malnutrition. This means that they are in danger of death and urgently need our help,” says Jens Lærke.Already on Tuesday, the BBC asked where Tom Fletcher got the startling figure.“We point to the urgent need to get supplies in to save the estimated 14,000 infants suffering from severe acute malnutrition in Gaza, as the IPC partnership has warned. We need to get the supplies in as quickly as possible, preferably within the next 48 hours,”  OCHA responded, according to the BBC .Jens Lærke confirms to TjekDet that the figure comes from the IPC, which assesses food security worldwide and with which the UN cooperates.  On May 12, the IPC issued a statement about acute food insecurity in Gaza.It states regarding emergency aid to Gaza that “immediate action is essential to prevent further deaths, hunger and acute malnutrition, and a move towards famine.”However, it does not say that 14,000 infants will die within two days.To TjekDet, the IPC explains that OCHA's interpretation is inaccurate. Instead, the IPC estimates that 14,100 children in Gaza under the age of five will be at risk of severe acute malnutrition. According to the IPC, this means that they risk dying from malnutrition within the next year if they do not receive treatment, but not within 48 hours, as Tom Fletcher said.Aid agencies have long reported widespread famine in Gaza. And although the UN now acknowledges that Tom Fletcher should have expressed himself differently, they emphasize that the situation in Gaza is critical and that thousands of children are at risk of dying from malnutrition over the next year.CheckDet has asked OCHA why Tom Fletcher sets 48 hours as the limit for emergency aid to arrive on time, when the IPC in their report mentions a period from April 2025 to March 2026. It is a  figure of speech , says Jens Lærke from OCHA.This is to emphasize that it has to be done quickly. We have been told by Israel that the current window for sending aid into Gaza is temporary. It is not necessarily 48 hours, because they have not set a time frame, but it is urgent, he says.Jens Lærke says that, to his knowledge, there is no official denial coming from the UN, but that it cannot be ruled out that one will come. He adds that OCHA has explained itself to many media outlets and in doing so has attempted to correct Tom Fletcher's statement.On Tuesday, a number of Danish media outlets published an article from Ritzau claiming that 14,000 infants in Gaza could die within two days.On Wednesday morning, Ritzau published a new article stating that the IPC's projection concerns children under five years of age, and that it concerns a period of one year and not two days.;Vanilla;Claim That 14,000 Infants in Gaza Will Die Within 48 Hours Is Incorrect, They Are at Risk of Severe Malnutrition Over the Next Year, UN Clarifies;Misstatement by UN Official: Tom Fletcher of the UN OCHA incorrectly stated on BBC Radio 4 that 14,000 babies in Gaza could die within 48 hours without aid, but this was a misrepresentation of data.Correct Context: The actual figure, based on IPC data, refers to 14,100 children under five in Gaza at risk of severe acute malnutrition over the coming year, not immediate death within two days.Clarification and Urgency: OCHA clarified the 48-hour reference was a figure of speech to stress urgency, not a literal deadline, and acknowledged the need for clearer communication while still emphasizing the dire humanitarian situation.;Verdict: MisleadingWhile the figure of 14,000 infants at risk is based on credible data, the claim that they could die within 48 hours is a significant misrepresentation. The actual data refers to long-term risk (over the next year), not immediate death. The statement exaggerates the urgency in a way that distorts the original meaning of the data.;False: Claim of 14,000 Gaza Infants Dying in 48 Hours Proven Inaccurate;Misleading Claim: The claim that 14,000 infants in Gaza would die within 48 hours was incorrect. This figure was stated by Tom Fletcher of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) on a BBC program. Actual Situation: OCHA clarified that Fletcher's wording was unclear. The correct information, derived from the IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification) partnership, is that 14,100 children under the age of five are at risk of severe acute malnutrition and could die within the next year if they do not receive treatment. 48 Hours Was a Figure of Speech: The 48 hours mentioned by Fletcher was a figure of speech intended to emphasize the extreme urgency of getting aid into Gaza, not a literal deadline for mass infant mortality. The IPC's projection for severe acute malnutrition risks spans from April 2025 to March 2026.;The verdict for this fact-check is False.While the underlying issue of severe malnutrition among children in Gaza is true and critical, the specific claim that 14,000 infants will die in the next 48 hours is demonstrably false due to misinterpretation and an inaccurate timeframe.;UN Officials's Claim That 14,000 Babies Will Die in Gaza Within 48 Hours is False;Inaccurate Claim: Tom Fletcher, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), claimed that 14,000 babies in Gaza would die within 48 hours without aid. However, this is not accurate according to the IPC, the source of the figure.Correct Interpretation: The IPC estimates that approximately 14,100 children under five in Gaza are at risk of severe acute malnutrition, which could lead to death within the next year if left untreated, not within 48 hours.Context and Correction: OCHA acknowledges Tom Fletcher's wording was unclear and emphasizes the critical situation in Gaza, where thousands of children are at risk of dying from malnutrition over the next year. They are working to correct the statement and stress the urgency of the situation.;Based on the fact-check, the verdict would be False.The claim that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within 48 hours if aid is not delivered is not supported by the IPC report, which estimates that children under five are at risk of severe acute malnutrition over the next year, not within a 48-hour timeframe. While the situation in Gaza is indeed critical, Tom Fletcher's statement was deemed to be an inaccurate representation of the IPC's findings.Meta AI response: Based on the fact-check, the verdict would be False. The claim that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within 48 hours if aid is not delivered is not supported by the IPC report, which estimates that children under five are at risk of severe acute malnutrition over the next year, not within a 48-hour timeframe.

The correct information, per the IPC, is that 14,100 children under five are at risk of severe acute malnutrition over the next year, not imminent death within 48 hours.

Their estimate is that 14,100 children in Gaza under the age of five will be at risk of severe acute malnutrition, meaning they risk dying from malnutrition within the next year if they do not receive treatment, not within 48 hours.BBC's inquiry to OCHA: OCHA responded to the BBC stating they were pointing to the urgent need to save an estimated 14,000 infants suffering from severe acute malnutrition as warned by the IPC, and that supplies needed to get in preferably within the next 48 hours.Ritzau's correction: A Danish news agency, Ritzau, initially published the 48-hour claim but later issued a new article correcting it to a one-year period for children under five.3.

FC_09;Bullet point summary;False claim about the death of 14,000 infants in Gaza spread in media worldwide - including in Danish;14,000 infants in Gaza are at risk of dying from malnutrition within two days, UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher said on Tuesday. But the information is not correct, TjekDet's research shows, and the UN itself acknowledges that Tom Fletcher should have phrased it differently. However, the UN emphasizes that the situation in Gaza is critical and that thousands of children are at risk of dying from malnutrition over the next year;This is the fact-check:This was reported  in several media outlets  both at home  and abroad on Tuesday , and  politicians and  social media users are reporting the startling figure. The information about the 14,000 infants also found its way into the closing debate of the Folketing on Wednesday.The figure comes from the head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), Tom Fletcher, who appeared on  the BBC's Radio 4 Today programme on Tuesday morning , where he advocated for the need for UN trucks to be allowed to deliver emergency aid to Gaza.Let me explain what's on those trucks. It's baby food. Baby nutrition. 14,000 babies will die in the next 48 hours if we can't get to them, says Tom Fletcher on the BBC program.But it is not correct that 14,000 infants in Gaza are in acute danger of dying within 48 hours. Tom Fletcher's wording was unclear, explains Jens Lærke, spokesperson for OCHA, to TjekDet.“He should have said that 14,000 babies are very likely to suffer from severe acute malnutrition. This means that they are in danger of death and urgently need our help,” says Jens Lærke.Already on Tuesday, the BBC asked where Tom Fletcher got the startling figure.“We point to the urgent need to get supplies in to save the estimated 14,000 infants suffering from severe acute malnutrition in Gaza, as the IPC partnership has warned. We need to get the supplies in as quickly as possible, preferably within the next 48 hours,”  OCHA responded, according to the BBC .Jens Lærke confirms to TjekDet that the figure comes from the IPC, which assesses food security worldwide and with which the UN cooperates.  On May 12, the IPC issued a statement about acute food insecurity in Gaza.It states regarding emergency aid to Gaza that “immediate action is essential to prevent further deaths, hunger and acute malnutrition, and a move towards famine.”However, it does not say that 14,000 infants will die within two days.To TjekDet, the IPC explains that OCHA's interpretation is inaccurate. Instead, the IPC estimates that 14,100 children in Gaza under the age of five will be at risk of severe acute malnutrition. According to the IPC, this means that they risk dying from malnutrition within the next year if they do not receive treatment, but not within 48 hours, as Tom Fletcher said.Aid agencies have long reported widespread famine in Gaza. And although the UN now acknowledges that Tom Fletcher should have expressed himself differently, they emphasize that the situation in Gaza is critical and that thousands of children are at risk of dying from malnutrition over the next year.CheckDet has asked OCHA why Tom Fletcher sets 48 hours as the limit for emergency aid to arrive on time, when the IPC in their report mentions a period from April 2025 to March 2026. It is a  figure of speech , says Jens Lærke from OCHA.This is to emphasize that it has to be done quickly. We have been told by Israel that the current window for sending aid into Gaza is temporary. It is not necessarily 48 hours, because they have not set a time frame, but it is urgent, he says.Jens Lærke says that, to his knowledge, there is no official denial coming from the UN, but that it cannot be ruled out that one will come. He adds that OCHA has explained itself to many media outlets and in doing so has attempted to correct Tom Fletcher's statement.On Tuesday, a number of Danish media outlets published an article from Ritzau claiming that 14,000 infants in Gaza could die within two days.On Wednesday morning, Ritzau published a new article stating that the IPC's projection concerns children under five years of age, and that it concerns a period of one year and not two days.;Chain-of-Thought;Claim That 14,000 Infants in Gaza Will Die Within 48 Hours Is False, UN Says Risk Is Over the Coming Year;1. Claim being evaluated:The claim under scrutiny is that 14,000 infants in Gaza are at acute risk of dying within 48 hours due to malnutrition. This figure was reported by Tom Fletcher, head of the UN OCHA, during a BBC Radio 4 interview, and then echoed by several media outlets and politicians.---2. Evidence examined: Tom Fletcher stated on the BBC program that 14,000 babies would die in the next 48 hours if emergency aid didn’t arrive. Jens Lærke, OCHA spokesperson, clarified that Fletcher’s wording was unclear, the 14,000 figure actually refers to babies suffering from severe acute malnutrition, meaning they are at risk but not necessarily dying imminently. The number originates from the IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification), which assesses food security worldwide. The IPC report from May 12 says about 14,100 children under five in Gaza are at risk of severe acute malnutrition. The IPC estimates that without treatment, these children risk dying within the next year, not within 48 hours. OCHA describes Fletcher’s “48 hours” as a figure of speech emphasizing urgency, related to the temporary window for aid delivery, not a literal deadline. Media corrections followed, clarifying the original claim was a misinterpretation or exaggeration of the IPC’s findings.---3. Verdict and reasoning:The fact-check concludes that the claim that 14,000 infants will die within 48 hours in Gaza is false and misleading. The 14,000 figure is accurate but refers to children under five at risk of severe acute malnutrition over a longer period (up to a year), not imminent death within two days. Fletcher’s statement was poorly worded, leading to misunderstanding. The situation is still critical and urgent, with thousands of children at serious risk, but the timeline given (48 hours) was a rhetorical device rather than a precise prediction. Subsequent clarifications by OCHA and media outlets corrected the record.;Here is a structured determination of the verdict for the fact-check, following your requested steps:--- 1. Identify the Claim Being EvaluatedThe claim is that:“14,000 infants in Gaza will die within the next 48 hours if emergency aid is not delivered.”This statement was made by Tom Fletcher, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.--- 2. Review of Key Evidence OCHA clarification: Tom Fletcher should have said 14,000 babies are likely to suffer from severe acute malnutrition, not that they would die in 48 hours. IPC data: The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) estimates that 14,100 children under age 5 in Gaza are at risk of severe acute malnutrition, meaning they could die within the next year if untreated—not within 48 hours. BBC follow-up: After being questioned, OCHA explained that the 48 hours remark was meant as a figure of speech to emphasize urgency, not a literal prediction. IPC statement: IPC itself called OCHA's interpretation inaccurate and clarified that their data does not support the claim of deaths occurring within 48 hours. Media correction: Danish media initially repeated the claim but later corrected it after clarification from IPC and OCHA.--- 3. Verdict and JustificationVerdict: FalseJustification:The claim that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within 48 hours is not supported by the data from the IPC or any authoritative source. The actual statistic concerns 14,100 children under five at risk of severe acute malnutrition over a year-long period if aid is not provided. OCHA itself acknowledged that Tom Fletcher's wording was misleading and has worked to clarify the statement. The 48 hours timeframe was used rhetorically and not based on data, and the IPC has explicitly stated the claim is inaccurate. Therefore, the claim is false.---;UN Official's Claim of 14,000 Gaza Infant Deaths in 48 Hours Deemed False, Based on Misinterpretation;The claim being evaluated in this fact-check is that 14,000 infants in Gaza would die within 48 hours if emergency aid did not reach them. This figure was reported by several media outlets and attributed to Tom Fletcher, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), during a BBC Radio 4 Today program.The main evidence provided to assess the truthfulness of this claim contradicts the initial statement. Jens Lærke, spokesperson for OCHA, clarified that Tom Fletcher's wording was unclear. He should have stated that 14,000 babies are likely to suffer from severe acute malnutrition, meaning they are in danger of death and urgently need help, but not within a 48-hour timeframe. OCHA further explained to the BBC that the figure of 14,000 infants suffering from severe acute malnutrition in Gaza comes from the IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification) partnership.The IPC itself, when contacted by TjekDet, stated that OCHA's interpretation was inaccurate. The IPC's estimate is that 14,100 children under the age of five in Gaza are at risk of severe acute malnutrition, which means they risk dying from malnutrition within the next year if they do not receive treatment, not within 48 hours. The 48-hour timeframe mentioned by Tom Fletcher was clarified by Jens Lærke as a figure of speech to emphasize urgency, given that the current window for sending aid into Gaza is temporary, not a precise deadline set by Israel.The verdict of the fact-check is that it is not correct that 14,000 infants in Gaza are in acute danger of dying within 48 hours. While the situation in Gaza is indeed critical, and thousands of children are at risk of dying from malnutrition over the next year if they do not receive treatment, the immediate 48-hour death toll claim was a misstatement and an inaccurate interpretation of the IPC's data. Ritzau, a Danish news agency, also published a corrected article acknowledging the IPC's projection concerns children under five over a one-year period, not two days.Here's a summary of the fact-check:1. Claim being evaluated: The core claim being evaluated is that 14,000 infants in Gaza are in acute danger of dying within the next 48 hours if emergency aid cannot reach them. This figure was reported by several media outlets and attributed to Tom Fletcher, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), during a BBC Radio 4 program.2. Main evidence provided:OCHA's clarification: Jens Lærke, spokesperson for OCHA, explains that Tom Fletcher's wording was unclear. Fletcher should have said that 14,000 babies are very likely to suffer from severe acute malnutrition, meaning they are in danger of death and urgently need help, but not specifically within 48 hours.IPC data: OCHA confirms the figure of 14,000 infants comes from the IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification), which assesses food security. A May 12 IPC statement warned of acute food insecurity in Gaza, stating that immediate action is essential to prevent further deaths, hunger and acute malnutrition, and a move towards famine.IPC's own explanation: The IPC itself clarifies that OCHA's interpretation was inaccurate. The IPC estimates that 14,100 children in Gaza under the age of five are at risk of severe acute malnutrition, and this risk means they could die from malnutrition within the next year if they do not receive treatment, not within 48 hours.48 hours as a figure of speech: Jens Lærke explains that Fletcher's mention of 48 hours was a figure of speech to emphasize urgency, based on Israel's communication that the current window for aid delivery is temporary. It was not a precise timeframe for the 14,000 infants' demise.Media corrections: Ritzau, a Danish news agency, initially reported the 48-hour claim but later published a new article correcting the timeframe to one year and clarifying that the IPC projection concerns children under five, not specifically infants.3. Verdict and key explanations: The fact-check concludes that it is not correct that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within 48 hours.The reasons for this verdict are:Tom Fletcher's statement was a miscommunication or an imprecise use of language.The actual data from the IPC indicates that 14,100 children under the age of five are at risk of severe acute malnutrition, and this risk of death is projected over a period of one year if they do not receive treatment, not 48 hours.The 48 hours was a rhetorical device used to highlight the extreme urgency of the aid situation and the temporary nature of aid access, not a literal prediction of immediate mortality for those 14,000 children.While the immediate death toll within 48 hours is false, the fact-check emphasizes that the situation in Gaza remains critical, and thousands of children are indeed at risk of dying from malnutrition over the next year.;1. Claim being evaluated: The claim is that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within the next 48 hours if emergency aid does not reach them. This was a statement made by Tom Fletcher, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).2. Key evidence provided: OCHA's Spokesperson (Jens Lærke): Confirmed that Tom Fletcher's wording was unclear and he should have said that 14,000 babies are very likely to suffer from severe acute malnutrition. He clarified that this means they are in danger of death and urgently need help, but not within a 48-hour timeframe. IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification) Report: The figure of 14,000 (specifically 14,100) comes from an IPC assessment. IPC's Clarification: The IPC explained that OCHA's interpretation was inaccurate. Their estimate is that 14,100 children under the age of five will be at risk of severe acute malnutrition, meaning they risk dying from malnutrition within the next year if they do not receive treatment, not within 48 hours. 48 hours as a figure of speech: Jens Lærke stated that Tom Fletcher used 48 hours as a figure of speech to emphasize urgency and the temporary nature of the aid window, not as a literal deadline for mass infant deaths. Media Corrections: Danish media outlets, including Ritzau, initially reported the 48-hour claim but later issued corrections based on the IPC's clarification of a one-year projection for children under five.3. Verdict: False.Justification: The claim that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within 48 hours is false. While the underlying figure of 14,000+ children at risk of severe acute malnutrition is indeed from a credible source (IPC), the timeframe and the specific demographic (infants vs. children under five) were miscommunicated. OCHA itself acknowledged the imprecision in Tom Fletcher's statement, clarifying that the risk of death due to severe acute malnutrition for these children is projected over a year, not 48 hours. The 48 hours was used as a rhetorical device to convey urgency, not a factual deadline for mortality.;False: UN Official's Claim That 14,000 Babies Will Die in Gaza Within 48 Hours;Claim Being EvaluatedThe claim being evaluated is a statement made by Tom Fletcher, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), on the BBC's Radio 4 Today program.

The IPC estimates that 14,100 children under five are at risk of severe acute malnutrition, which could lead to death within the next year if left untreated, not within 48 hours as claimed. OCHA acknowledges that Tom Fletcher's wording was unclear and emphasizes the critical situation in Gaza, where thousands of children are at risk of dying from malnutrition over the next year. The 48-hour timeframe mentioned by Tom Fletcher was a figure of speech to emphasize urgency, given the temporary window for sending aid into Gaza.;Let's determine the verdict for the fact-check.1.

OCHA acknowledges that Tom Fletcher's wording was unclear and misleading. While the situation in Gaza is critical, and thousands of children are at risk of dying from malnutrition, the specific claim about 14,000 babies dying within 48 hours is not supported by the evidence.;False: Claim of 14,000 Gaza Infants Dying in 48 Hours Without Aid Misrepresents Year-Long Malnutrition Risk;1. Claim Being EvaluatedThe core claim is that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within 48 hours if emergency aid, specifically baby food and nutrition, is not delivered. This statement was made by Tom Fletcher, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, and was widely reported by media outlets and discussed by politicians and social media users.2. Main Evidence ProvidedSource of the Claim: Tom Fletcher’s statement on BBC Radio 4, advocating for urgent aid delivery to Gaza, specifically mentioning 14,000 infants at risk of death in 48 hours.Clarification from OCHA: Jens Lærke, OCHA spokesperson, told TjekDet that Fletcher’s wording was unclear. He meant that 14,000 babies are likely to suffer from severe acute malnutrition, which puts them at risk of death without urgent aid, but not necessarily within 48 hours.IPC Data: The figure of 14,000 originates from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), which OCHA collaborates with. The IPC’s May 12 statement estimated that 14,100 children under five in Gaza are at risk of severe acute malnutrition, with a risk of death within one year if untreated, not 48 hours. The IPC explicitly called OCHA’s 48-hour interpretation inaccurate.Context of 48-Hour Urgency: Lærke explained to TjekDet that the 48-hour timeline was a figure of speech to emphasize urgency, as Israel had indicated a temporary window for aid delivery without a specific timeframe.Media Corrections: Danish media outlet Ritzau initially reported the 48-hour claim but later corrected it, clarifying that the IPC projection refers to children under five over a one-year period.Broader Context: Aid agencies have reported widespread famine in Gaza, and OCHA acknowledges the critical situation, with thousands of children at risk of malnutrition-related deaths over the next year.3. Verdict and JustificationThe fact-check concludes that the claim of 14,000 infants dying within 48 hours is incorrect.Reasons: Tom Fletcher’s statement misrepresented the IPC’s data, which indicates 14,100 children under five are at risk of severe acute malnutrition and potential death within one year, not 48 hours. The 48-hour timeframe was a rhetorical device to stress urgency, not a factual deadline. OCHA’s Jens Lærke admitted the wording was unclear, and the IPC confirmed the interpretation was inaccurate.Key Explanations: The discrepancy between the 48-hour claim and the IPC’s one-year projection, combined with OCHA’s clarification and lack of evidence supporting imminent deaths within two days, led to the verdict. The fact-check emphasizes that while the situation in Gaza is dire, the specific claim exaggerated the timeline of the risk.1,1s; 1. Identification of the ClaimThe claim being evaluated is that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within 48 hours if emergency aid, specifically baby food and nutrition, is not delivered. This statement was made by Tom Fletcher, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), during an interview on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 2. Review of Key EvidenceThe fact-check provides the following evidence to assess the claim:- OCHA Clarification: Jens Lærke, OCHA spokesperson, stated that Tom Fletcher’s claim was unclear. Instead of 14,000 infants dying within 48 hours, Fletcher meant that 14,000 babies are at risk of severe acute malnutrition, which could lead to death if aid is not provided urgently. This indicates a longer-term risk, not an immediate 48-hour deadline.- IPC Assessment: The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), the source of the 14,000 figure, estimates that 14,100 children under five in Gaza are at risk of severe acute malnutrition over the next year (April 2025 to March 2026) if untreated. The IPC explicitly called OCHA’s interpretation of their data as implying death within 48 hours inaccurate.- Explanation of the 48-Hour Timeline: Lærke explained that the 48-hour timeframe was a figure of speech to emphasize the urgency of delivering aid due to a temporary aid access window permitted by Israel, not a literal deadline for 14,000 infant deaths.- Media Correction: Danish media outlet Ritzau initially reported the 48-hour death claim but later corrected it to align with the IPC’s projection, stating that the risk applies to children under five over one year, not two days.- Context of Gaza’s Crisis: The fact-check acknowledges widespread famine in Gaza and the UN’s emphasis that thousands of children are at risk of malnutrition-related deaths over the next year, but this does not support the specific 48-hour claim. 3. Verdict and JustificationVerdict: FalseThe claim that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within 48 hours without emergency aid is false based on the evidence provided:- Incorrect Timeline: The IPC, the authoritative source for the 14,000 figure, states that the risk of severe acute malnutrition applies to 14,100 children under five over a year, not 48 hours. The IPC explicitly rejected OCHA’s interpretation as inaccurate.- Misleading Urgency: Tom Fletcher’s use of a 48-hour deadline was a rhetorical device to stress urgency, not a fact-based claim. Jens Lærke confirmed that no literal 48-hour deadline exists, and the timeframe was meant to highlight the temporary nature of the aid access window.- Corrective Actions: OCHA’s clarifications to media and Ritzau’s corrected article further confirm that the original claim misrepresented the IPC’s findings, aligning with a year-long risk period rather than an imminent 48-hour crisis.While the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is severe, with significant risks of malnutrition-related deaths over time, the specific claim of 14,000 infants dying within 48 hours lacks evidence and is contradicted by the IPC’s data and OCHA’s own clarifications.

On May 12, the IPC issued a statement about acute food insecurity in Gaza.It states regarding emergency aid to Gaza that “immediate action is essential to prevent further deaths, hunger and acute malnutrition, and a move towards famine.”However, it does not say that 14,000 infants will die within two days.To TjekDet, the IPC explains that OCHA's interpretation is inaccurate. Instead, the IPC estimates that 14,100 children in Gaza under the age of five will be at risk of severe acute malnutrition. According to the IPC, this means that they risk dying from malnutrition within the next year if they do not receive treatment, but not within 48 hours, as Tom Fletcher said.Aid agencies have long reported widespread famine in Gaza. And although the UN now acknowledges that Tom Fletcher should have expressed himself differently, they emphasize that the situation in Gaza is critical and that thousands of children are at risk of dying from malnutrition over the next year.CheckDet has asked OCHA why Tom Fletcher sets 48 hours as the limit for emergency aid to arrive on time, when the IPC in their report mentions a period from April 2025 to March 2026. It is a  figure of speech , says Jens Lærke from OCHA.This is to emphasize that it has to be done quickly. We have been told by Israel that the current window for sending aid into Gaza is temporary. It is not necessarily 48 hours, because they have not set a time frame, but it is urgent, he says.Jens Lærke says that, to his knowledge, there is no official denial coming from the UN, but that it cannot be ruled out that one will come. He adds that OCHA has explained itself to many media outlets and in doing so has attempted to correct Tom Fletcher's statement.On Tuesday, a number of Danish media outlets published an article from Ritzau claiming that 14,000 infants in Gaza could die within two days.On Wednesday morning, Ritzau published a new article stating that the IPC's projection concerns children under five years of age, and that it concerns a period of one year and not two days.;Contextual;Claim that 14,000 Infants in Gaza Will Die Within 48 Hours Is False — Risk of Death Spans Up to a Year Without Aid;1. The claim: Tom Fletcher, head of the UN OCHA, stated on BBC Radio 4 that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within 48 hours without emergency aid.2. The evidence: The figure of 14,000 comes from the IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification), which estimates that about 14,100 children under five in Gaza are at risk of severe acute malnutrition. However, IPC’s data indicates these children risk dying over the course of a year without treatment—not within 48 hours. OCHA acknowledges Fletcher’s wording was unclear and that the 48-hour timeframe was a figure of speech emphasizing urgency, not a precise prediction. Media outlets initially reported the claim as literal but later corrected it.3. The verdict: The claim is false;1. Claim being assessed:The claim is that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within 48 hours if emergency aid is not delivered.2. Verdict:False (or misleading).3. Reasoning;Fact Check: Claim of 14,000 Gaza Infants Dying in 48 Hours is False;The claim being assessed is that 14,000 infants in Gaza are in acute danger of dying within 48 hours due to a lack of emergency aid. This figure was reported by Tom Fletcher, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), on the BBC's Radio 4 Today program.The evidence provided to evaluate the claim includes clarifications from OCHA spokesperson Jens Lærke and the IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification) partnership. Jens Lærke explained that Tom Fletcher's wording was unclear and he should have said that 14,000 babies are very likely to suffer from severe acute malnutrition, meaning they are in danger of death and urgently need help, but not necessarily within 48 hours. OCHA stated that the figure of 14,000 infants suffering from severe acute malnutrition comes from the IPC partnership. The IPC, however, clarified that their estimate is that 14,100 children under the age of five in Gaza will be at risk of severe acute malnutrition, meaning they risk dying from malnutrition within the next year if they do not receive treatment, not within 48 hours. Jens Lærke also stated that the 48 hours mentioned by Tom Fletcher was a figure of speech to emphasize urgency, and not a set timeframe by Israel for aid delivery.The verdict is that the claim, as initially stated by Tom Fletcher, is false regarding the 48-hour timeframe for the death of 14,000 infants. While the figure of approximately 14,000 infants (specifically children under five) at risk of severe acute malnutrition is confirmed by the IPC, the timeframe for their potential death is within the next year if untreated, not within 48 hours. The situation in Gaza remains critical, and thousands of children are indeed at risk of dying from malnutrition over the next year, as emphasized by aid agencies.Here's a concise summary of the fact-check:1. The Claim:Tom Fletcher, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), claimed on BBC's Radio 4 Today programme that 14,000 infants in Gaza would die within the next 48 hours if emergency aid couldn't reach them. This figure was widely reported by media outlets and politicians.2. The Evidence:OCHA spokesperson Jens Lærke clarified that Fletcher's wording was unclear. He should have stated that 14,000 babies are very likely to suffer from severe acute malnutrition, meaning they are in danger of death and need urgent help.The figure of 14,000 (specifically 14,100) children comes from the IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification), which assesses food security.The IPC's May 12 statement indicates that 14,100 children under five in Gaza are at risk of severe acute malnutrition and could die from it within the next year if they don't receive treatment, not within 48 hours. The IPC itself stated OCHA's interpretation was inaccurate.The 48 hours timeframe used by Fletcher was explained by Lærke as a figure of speech to emphasize urgency, given that Israel had communicated a temporary window for aid, though no specific timeframe was set by them.3. The Verdict:False. While the underlying concern about severe acute malnutrition among 14,000 children in Gaza is accurate, the claim that they would die within 48 hours is incorrect. The IPC data, which OCHA referenced, projects this risk over a period of one year if treatment is not received. OCHA has acknowledged the imprecise wording and attempted to clarify the statement to various media outlets.;Here's the final verdict on the fact-check:1. What is the claim being assessed?The claim assessed is that 14,000 infants in Gaza would die within 48 hours if emergency aid did not reach them. This statement was made by Tom Fletcher, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), on the BBC's Radio 4 Today programme.2. What is the verdict?False.3. What reasoning or evidence supports this decision?The verdict is false based on the following: OCHA's own clarification: Jens Lærke, spokesperson for OCHA, clarified that Tom Fletcher's wording was imprecise. Fletcher should have said that 14,000 babies are very likely to suffer from severe acute malnutrition, which implies a danger of death requiring urgent help, but not within a 48-hour window. IPC data misinterpretation: The figure of 14,000 (specifically 14,100) children comes from the IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification), with whom the UN cooperates. The IPC states that 14,100 children under the age of five are estimated to be at risk of severe acute malnutrition and could die from it within the next year if they do not receive treatment. The IPC explicitly stated that OCHA's interpretation of a 48-hour timeframe was inaccurate. Figure of speech for urgency: OCHA explained that the 48 hours mentioned by Tom Fletcher was a figure of speech to emphasize the urgent need for aid to arrive quickly, especially given that Israel had communicated a temporary window for aid delivery, though no specific timeframe was set.In essence, while the severe humanitarian crisis and the risk of malnutrition among thousands of children in Gaza are dire and acknowledged, the specific claim of 14,000 infants dying within 48 hours was an inaccurate representation of the underlying data and timeframe.;False Claim: 14,000 Babies Won't Die in 48 Hours Without Aid, IPC Report Shows Risk Over Next Year, Not 48 Hours;Fact-Check SummaryThe ClaimThe claim being assessed is that 14,000 babies in Gaza will die within 48 hours if they don't receive emergency aid, as stated by Tom Fletcher, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), on the BBC's Radio 4 Today program.The EvidenceThe main evidence provided to evaluate the claim comes from:IPC Report: The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) partnership estimates that 14,100 children under five years old in Gaza will be at risk of severe acute malnutrition, which could lead to death within the next year if left untreated.OCHA Statement: OCHA initially supported the claim, citing the IPC partnership's warning, but later clarified that Tom Fletcher's wording was unclear and should have referred to the risk of severe acute malnutrition.IPC Clarification: The IPC denies OCHA's interpretation, stating that their report does not mention 14,000 infants dying within 48 hours.The VerdictThe verdict is that the claim is False. The evidence shows that while thousands of children in Gaza are indeed at risk of severe acute malnutrition and death, the specific claim about 14,000 babies dying within 48 hours is not supported by the IPC report. Instead, the report projects a risk of severe acute malnutrition over the next year. OCHA has acknowledged that Tom Fletcher's statement was unclear and has attempted to correct it ¹.;Final VerdictThe Claim: The claim being assessed is that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within 48 hours if they don't receive emergency aid, as stated by Tom Fletcher, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).The Verdict: FalseReasoning and Evidence: The claim is deemed false because the evidence from the IPC report and OCHA's clarification shows that:The IPC report estimates 14,100 children under five years old are at risk of severe acute malnutrition, which could lead to death within the next year if left untreated, not within 48 hours.The IPC denies OCHA's interpretation, stating that their report does not support the claim of 14,000 infants dying within 48 hours.OCHA acknowledges that Tom Fletcher's wording was unclear and should have referred to the risk of severe acute malnutrition, rather than implying an immediate threat of death within 48 hours.The evidence suggests that while the situation in Gaza is critical, and thousands of children are at risk of severe acute malnutrition, the specific claim about 14,000 babies dying within 48 hours is not supported by the IPC report or OCHA's clarification.Meta AI response: Final Verdict The Claim: The claim being assessed is that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within 48 hours if they don't receive emergency aid, as stated by Tom Fletcher, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). The Verdict: False Reasoning and Evidence: The claim is deemed false because the evidence from the IPC report and OCHA's clarification shows that: The IPC report estimates 14,100 children under five years old are at risk of severe acute malnutrition, which could lead to death within the next year if left untreated, not within 48 hours. The IPC denies OCHA's interpretation, stating that their report does not support the claim of 14,000 infants dying within 48 hours.

The Claim: Tom Fletcher, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), stated on BBC Radio 4 that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within 48 hours if UN trucks cannot deliver emergency aid, specifically baby food and nutrition.2. The Evidence: - Jens Lærke, OCHA spokesperson, clarified to TjekDet that Fletcher’s statement was inaccurate. The figure of 14,000 refers to infants at risk of severe acute malnutrition, not imminent death within 48 hours.- The figure originates from the IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification), which estimates 14,100 children under five in Gaza are at risk of severe acute malnutrition over the next year (April 2025–March 2026) if untreated, not within 48 hours.- The IPC stated OCHA’s interpretation was inaccurate, emphasizing the risk of death over a year, not two days.- Lærke explained the 48-hour timeframe was a figure of speech to stress urgency, as Israel indicated a temporary window for aid delivery without a specific deadline.- Ritzau initially reported the 48-hour claim but later corrected it to reflect the IPC’s one-year projection.3. The Verdict: The claim is false. Tom Fletcher’s assertion that 14,000 infants will die within 48 hours is incorrect. The IPC data indicates 14,100 children under five are at risk of severe acute malnutrition over a year, not imminent death in two days. The 48-hour timeframe was a rhetorical device to highlight urgency, not a precise deadline.;Final Verdict1. Claim Being Assessed: Tom Fletcher, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), claimed on BBC Radio 4 that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within 48 hours if UN trucks cannot deliver emergency aid, specifically baby food and nutrition.2. Verdict: False3. Reasoning and Evidence Supporting the Decision:- Jens Lærke, OCHA spokesperson, clarified to TjekDet that Fletcher’s statement was inaccurate. The figure of 14,000 refers to infants at risk of severe acute malnutrition, not facing imminent death within 48 hours.- The figure comes from the IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification), which estimates 14,100 children under five in Gaza are at risk of severe acute malnutrition over a one-year period (April 2025–March 2026) if untreated, not within 48 hours.- The IPC explicitly stated that OCHA’s interpretation of their data as implying 14,000 infants would die in 48 hours was inaccurate.- Lærke explained the 48-hour timeframe was a rhetorical device to emphasize the urgency of delivering aid, given Israel’s temporary window for aid access, not a literal deadline.- Ritzau initially reported the 48-hour claim but later issued a correction aligning with the IPC’s one-year projection. The evidence shows the claim misrepresents the timeline and severity of the risk to infants, making it false.
FC_09;Bullet point summary;False claim about the death of 14,000 infants in Gaza spread in media worldwide - including in Danish;14,000 infants in Gaza are at risk of dying from malnutrition within two days, UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher said on Tuesday. But the information is not correct, TjekDet's research shows, and the UN itself acknowledges that Tom Fletcher should have phrased it differently. However, the UN emphasizes that the situation in Gaza is critical and that thousands of children are at risk of dying from malnutrition over the next year;This is the fact-check:This was reported  in several media outlets  both at home  and abroad on Tuesday , and  politicians and  social media users are reporting the startling figure. The information about the 14,000 infants also found its way into the closing debate of the Folketing on Wednesday.The figure comes from the head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), Tom Fletcher, who appeared on  the BBC's Radio 4 Today programme on Tuesday morning , where he advocated for the need for UN trucks to be allowed to deliver emergency aid to Gaza.Let me explain what's on those trucks. It's baby food. Baby nutrition. 14,000 babies will die in the next 48 hours if we can't get to them, says Tom Fletcher on the BBC program.But it is not correct that 14,000 infants in Gaza are in acute danger of dying within 48 hours.

This assertion originated from a statement by Tom Fletcher of the UN’s OCHA during a BBC interview but was a misinterpretation of the data from the IPC, which estimates that around 14,100 children under five in Gaza face severe acute malnutrition and risk of death within a year if untreated. OCHA clarified that Fletcher’s “48 hours” was a rhetorical device meant to convey urgency rather than a precise timeline. Media outlets initially reported the alarming 48-hour death figure but later corrected it to reflect the IPC’s projection over a longer timeframe. While the immediate death toll claim is inaccurate, the underlying situation remains critical, with thousands of children at risk over the coming year if aid does not reach Gaza promptly.;1. What is the claim being evaluated?That 14,000 infants in Gaza are in acute danger of dying within 48 hours if emergency aid is not delivered immediately.2. Based on the evidence provided, is the claim true, false, mixed or another verdict category?Mixed.3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict?The claim that 14,000 infants will die within 48 hours is false—this was a misinterpretation of data. The IPC’s assessment indicates that about 14,100 children under five in Gaza are at risk of severe acute malnutrition and potential death, but this risk spans approximately one year, not 48 hours. OCHA clarified that the “48 hours” timeframe was a figure of speech to stress urgency, not a literal prediction. Therefore, while the immediate death toll claim is incorrect, the broader fact that thousands of children are at serious risk without urgent aid is true.--- Final Verdict:The claim that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within 48 hours without aid is false. However, the underlying situation—that around 14,000 children under five are at severe risk of dying from malnutrition within the next year without treatment—is accurate. Thus, the verdict is mixed, reflecting a miscommunication about the timeframe but confirming the critical nature of the humanitarian crisis.;Gaza Infant Death Claim Unclear: UN Clarifies 14,000 Children at Risk of Malnutrition Over Year, Not 48 Hours;The claim that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within the next 48 hours without aid is mixed. While Tom Fletcher of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) made this statement, OCHA later clarified that his wording was unclear. The accurate information, derived from the IPC (which assesses food security), is that an estimated 14,100 children under the age of five are at risk of severe acute malnutrition. According to the IPC, these children could die from malnutrition within the next year if they do not receive treatment, not within a 48-hour window. OCHA explained that the 48 hours was a figure of speech used by Fletcher to emphasize the extreme urgency of getting aid into Gaza, given a temporary window for deliveries. Therefore, while the severe risk of malnutrition for thousands of children is accurate, the immediate 48-hour death timeline is not.;1. What is the claim being evaluated?The claim being evaluated is that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within the next 48 hours if emergency aid cannot reach them.2. Based on the evidence provided, is the claim true, false, mixed or another verdict category?Mixed.3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict?The claim originated from Tom Fletcher, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), who stated it on BBC Radio 4.

The actual data from the IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification) indicates that 14,100 children under the age of five are at risk of severe acute malnutrition and could die from it within the next year if they do not receive treatment. The 48 hours timeframe was a figure of speech used by Fletcher to emphasize urgency for aid delivery due to a temporary aid window, not a literal prediction from the IPC report. Therefore, while a significant number of children are indeed at severe risk of malnutrition and potential death, the specific immediate timeframe of 48 hours is incorrect.Final Verdict: The claim is mixed. While the dire situation regarding severe acute malnutrition among approximately 14,000 children under five in Gaza is accurate, and they are indeed at risk of death without aid, the assertion that this will occur specifically within 48 hours is false. The 48-hour timeframe was a rhetorical device used to convey urgency, not a factual projection from the underlying data.;Claim That 14,000 Infants Will Die in Gaza Within 48 Hours is False;The claim that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within 48 hours without aid is false. Tom Fletcher's statement was based on an estimate from the IPC partnership, but his wording was unclear and misleading. According to the IPC, the actual risk is that 14,100 children under five may suffer from severe acute malnutrition, potentially leading to death within a year if left untreated. OCHA has acknowledged the need for clarification and emphasized the urgency of the situation in Gaza, but the evidence does not support the claim of imminent death within 48 hours. Instead, it highlights a critical situation requiring immediate attention to prevent further deaths and malnutrition over a longer period.;Verdict Determination1. What is the claim being evaluated?The claim being evaluated is that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within 48 hours if emergency aid does not reach them, as stated by Tom Fletcher, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), on the BBC's Radio 4 Today program.2.

The verdict is that this claim is false. Key evidence refuting the claim includes clarifications from OCHA spokesperson Jens Lærke, who explained that Fletcher’s statement was misleading, he intended to convey that 14,000 babies are at risk of severe acute malnutrition, not that they would die within 48 hours. The figure originates from the IPC, which estimates that 14,100 children under five in Gaza face severe acute malnutrition over the next year, not two days, if untreated. Lærke further noted that the 48-hour timeframe was a rhetorical device to stress urgency, not a literal deadline, as no specific timeframe was set by Israel for aid delivery. Additionally, Danish media outlet Ritzau initially reported the incorrect 48-hour claim but later issued a correction aligning with the IPC’s one-year projection. This evidence collectively demonstrates that the claim exaggerated the immediacy of the threat, leading to the false verdict. While the situation in Gaza remains critical, with thousands of children at risk of malnutrition-related deaths over the next year, the specific assertion of 14,000 infants dying within 48 hours is not supported by the IPC’s data or OCHA’s clarifications.; Brief Answers1. What is the claim being evaluated? The claim is that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within 48 hours if emergency aid does not reach them, as stated by Tom Fletcher on BBC Radio 4.2. Based on the evidence provided, is the claim true, false, mixed, or another verdict category? The claim is false.3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict? - OCHA spokesperson Jens Lærke clarified that Tom Fletcher’s statement was inaccurate, he meant 14,000 babies are at risk of severe acute malnutrition, not that they would die within 48 hours. - The IPC, the source of the figure, estimates 14,100 children under five are at risk of severe acute malnutrition over the next year, not 48 hours, if untreated. - The 48-hour timeframe was described by Lærke as a rhetorical device to emphasize urgency, not a literal deadline. - Ritzau corrected its initial report of the 48-hour claim to align with the IPC’s one-year projection. Final VerdictThe claim that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within 48 hours without emergency aid is false. This verdict is supported by OCHA’s clarification that Tom Fletcher’s statement was misleading, as he intended to highlight that 14,000 babies are at risk of severe acute malnutrition, not immediate death. The IPC, cited as the source, projects that 14,100 children under five face this risk over the next year, not 48 hours. Additionally, the 48-hour timeframe was a rhetorical exaggeration to underscore urgency, not a factual deadline, and Ritzau’s correction of its initial report further aligns with the IPC’s longer-term assessment.

It is a  figure of speech , says Jens Lærke from OCHA.This is to emphasize that it has to be done quickly. We have been told by Israel that the current window for sending aid into Gaza is temporary. It is not necessarily 48 hours, because they have not set a time frame, but it is urgent, he says.Jens Lærke says that, to his knowledge, there is no official denial coming from the UN, but that it cannot be ruled out that one will come. He adds that OCHA has explained itself to many media outlets and in doing so has attempted to correct Tom Fletcher's statement.On Tuesday, a number of Danish media outlets published an article from Ritzau claiming that 14,000 infants in Gaza could die within two days.On Wednesday morning, Ritzau published a new article stating that the IPC's projection concerns children under five years of age, and that it concerns a period of one year and not two days.;Role;Claim that 14,000 Infants in Gaza Will Die Within 48 Hours Is False, Says UN Data;Claim:The claim being evaluated is that 14,000 infants in Gaza are at risk of dying within 48 hours due to severe malnutrition.Evidence: The figure originated from Tom Fletcher, head of the UN OCHA, who said on BBC Radio 4 that 14,000 babies would die in the next 48 hours if aid did not reach Gaza. OCHA later clarified through spokesperson Jens Lærke that Fletcher’s wording was inaccurate, the correct interpretation is that 14,000 children are at risk of severe acute malnutrition and urgently need aid to prevent death, but not within 48 hours. The source of the figure is the IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification), which states that about 14,100 children under five in Gaza are at risk of severe acute malnutrition over the course of a year (April 2025–March 2026), not within two days. Aid agencies confirm the critical situation and the urgent need for aid but do not support the claim of an imminent mass death within 48 hours. OCHA admits the 48-hour timeframe was a figure of speech to emphasize urgency due to temporary aid windows, not a literal deadline.Verdict:The claim that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within 48 hours is false. The evidence shows that while many children are at serious risk of dying from malnutrition if not treated, this risk extends over the next year, not two days. Tom Fletcher’s original statement was a miscommunication clarified by OCHA and IPC data.;1. Claim being assessed:That 14,000 infants in Gaza are at risk of dying within 48 hours due to severe malnutrition.2. Final verdict:False.3. Explanation:The evidence shows that the figure of 14,000 children at risk comes from the IPC’s assessment of severe acute malnutrition affecting children under five in Gaza over the course of a year—not within 48 hours. Tom Fletcher’s original statement on BBC misrepresented the timeline, which OCHA later clarified as a figure of speech to stress urgency, not a literal deadline. Thus, while the situation is critical and many children urgently need aid, the claim of 14,000 infants dying within two days is incorrect.;Gaza Infants Death Claim: 14,000 Babies Not Dying in 48 Hours, UN Official's Wording Misleading;Evidence:The figure was stated by Tom Fletcher, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), on the BBC's Radio 4 Today programme.OCHA spokesperson Jens Lærke clarified that Fletcher's wording was unclear. Fletcher should have said that 14,000 babies are very likely to suffer from severe acute malnutrition, meaning they are in danger of death and urgently need help.OCHA confirmed the figure of 14,000 infants comes from the IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification), which assesses food security.The IPC itself explained to TjekDet that OCHA's interpretation was inaccurate. The IPC estimates that 14,100 children in Gaza under the age of five are at risk of severe acute malnutrition, meaning they risk dying from malnutrition within the next year if they do not receive treatment, not within 48 hours.Jens Lærke stated that the 48 hours timeframe used by Fletcher was a figure of speech to emphasize urgency, given that the window for aid delivery from Israel is temporary. The IPC's report mentions a period from April 2025 to March 2026.Ritzau, a Danish news agency, initially reported the incorrect 48-hour claim but later published a correction.Verdict: False.While the situation in Gaza is critical and thousands of children are at risk of severe acute malnutrition, the claim that 14,000 infants will die within 48 hours is incorrect. The figure of 14,000 (specifically 14,100 children under five) refers to those at risk of severe acute malnutrition over the course of a year, according to the IPC. The 48-hour timeframe was an emphasis on urgency by OCHA, not a precise medical or logistical deadline for mass casualties.;1. Claim Being Assessed:The claim is that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within 48 hours if emergency aid cannot reach them.2. Final Verdict:False.3. Explanation of How the Evidence Supports the Verdict:The evidence clearly refutes the claim of infants dying within 48 hours. While an OCHA official, Tom Fletcher, initially stated this figure and timeframe on a BBC program, his organization, OCHA, quickly clarified that his wording was unclear. OCHA's spokesperson, Jens Lærke, explained that the correct statement should have been that 14,000 babies are very likely to suffer from severe acute malnutrition, which puts them in danger of death and in urgent need of help.Furthermore, the figure itself comes from the IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification), a body that assesses food security. The IPC explicitly stated that OCHA's interpretation was inaccurate. According to the IPC, 14,100 children in Gaza under the age of five are at risk of severe acute malnutrition, meaning they risk dying from malnutrition within the next year if they do not receive treatment, not within 48 hours. The 48-hour timeframe was a figure of speech used by OCHA to emphasize the critical and urgent need for aid, not a literal deadline for mass fatalities.;False Claim: UN Official's Warning That 14,000 Babies Will Die in Gaza Within 48 Hours Without Aid is Exaggerated;Fact-Check SummaryClaim: 14,000 babies in Gaza will die within 48 hours if emergency aid doesn't arrive.Evidence:The claim originated from Tom Fletcher, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), during an appearance on BBC's Radio 4 Today program.OCHA later clarified that the figure of 14,000 babies comes from the IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification), which estimates that 14,100 children under five in Gaza are at risk of severe acute malnutrition.The IPC report projects this risk over a period from April 2025 to March 2026, not within 48 hours.Jens Lærke, OCHA spokesperson, acknowledged that Tom Fletcher's wording was unclear and that the 48-hour timeframe was a figure of speech to emphasize urgency.Verdict: False.The evidence shows that while thousands of children in Gaza are indeed at risk of severe acute malnutrition and death, the specific claim that 14,000 babies will die within 48 hours is not supported by the IPC report or OCHA's clarification. The timeframe and age group specified in the claim do not match the IPC's projections. The situation in Gaza is critical, but the claim exaggerates the urgency ¹.;VerdictClaim: 14,000 babies in Gaza will die within 48 hours if emergency aid doesn't arrive.Verdict: FalseExplanation: The claim is false because the evidence from the IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification) and OCHA (UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs) shows that:The estimated number of children at risk is 14,100, but this refers to children under five years old, not just babies.The risk of severe acute malnutrition and death is projected over a period from April 2025 to March 2026, not within 48 hours.OCHA's spokesperson, Jens Lærke, acknowledged that Tom Fletcher's statement was unclear and that the 48-hour timeframe was a figure of speech to emphasize urgency, rather than a literal prediction.The evidence demonstrates a significant discrepancy between the claim and the actual projections, leading to a verdict of False.Meta AI response: Verdict Claim: 14,000 babies in Gaza will die within 48 hours if emergency aid doesn't arrive. Verdict: False Explanation: The claim is false because the evidence from the IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification) and OCHA (UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs) shows that: The estimated number of children at risk is 14,100, but this refers to children under five years old, not just babies.

Jens Lærke, OCHA spokesperson, clarified that Fletcher meant 14,000 infants are at risk of severe acute malnutrition, which could lead to death without urgent aid, but not within 48 hours. The figure originates from the IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification), which estimates 14,100 children under five in Gaza are at risk of severe acute malnutrition over the next year (April 2025–March 2026), not two days. The IPC called OCHA’s interpretation “inaccurate.” Lærke explained the 48-hour timeframe was a figure of speech to emphasize urgency, as Israel indicated a temporary window for aid delivery. Ritzau initially reported the 48-hour claim but later corrected it to reflect the IPC’s one-year projection.Verdict: False. The claim that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within 48 hours is incorrect. Evidence from the IPC and OCHA shows the risk of death from severe acute malnutrition applies to 14,100 children under five over a year, not two days. The 48-hour timeframe was a rhetorical device, not a factual deadline.;Claim: Tom Fletcher, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), stated on BBC Radio 4 that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within 48 hours if emergency aid is not delivered.Verdict: False.Explanation: The evidence shows that Tom Fletcher’s statement was inaccurate. The IPC, which OCHA cited, estimates that 14,100 children under five in Gaza are at risk of severe acute malnutrition over a year (April 2025–March 2026), not within 48 hours. OCHA’s spokesperson, Jens Lærke, clarified that Fletcher meant these children are at risk of death without urgent aid, but the 48-hour timeframe was a rhetorical device to emphasize urgency, not a factual deadline. The IPC deemed OCHA’s interpretation “inaccurate,” and Ritzau corrected its initial report to reflect the one-year timeframe. Thus, the claim that 14,000 infants will die within 48 hours is false, as the risk is over a longer period.
FC_09;Bullet point summary;False claim about the death of 14,000 infants in Gaza spread in media worldwide - including in Danish;14,000 infants in Gaza are at risk of dying from malnutrition within two days, UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher said on Tuesday. But the information is not correct, TjekDet's research shows, and the UN itself acknowledges that Tom Fletcher should have phrased it differently. However, the UN emphasizes that the situation in Gaza is critical and that thousands of children are at risk of dying from malnutrition over the next year;This is the fact-check:This was reported  in several media outlets  both at home  and abroad on Tuesday , and  politicians and  social media users are reporting the startling figure. The information about the 14,000 infants also found its way into the closing debate of the Folketing on Wednesday.The figure comes from the head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), Tom Fletcher, who appeared on  the BBC's Radio 4 Today programme on Tuesday morning , where he advocated for the need for UN trucks to be allowed to deliver emergency aid to Gaza.Let me explain what's on those trucks. It's baby food. Baby nutrition. 14,000 babies will die in the next 48 hours if we can't get to them, says Tom Fletcher on the BBC program.But it is not correct that 14,000 infants in Gaza are in acute danger of dying within 48 hours. Tom Fletcher's wording was unclear, explains Jens Lærke, spokesperson for OCHA, to TjekDet.“He should have said that 14,000 babies are very likely to suffer from severe acute malnutrition. This means that they are in danger of death and urgently need our help,” says Jens Lærke.Already on Tuesday, the BBC asked where Tom Fletcher got the startling figure.“We point to the urgent need to get supplies in to save the estimated 14,000 infants suffering from severe acute malnutrition in Gaza, as the IPC partnership has warned. We need to get the supplies in as quickly as possible, preferably within the next 48 hours,”  OCHA responded, according to the BBC .Jens Lærke confirms to TjekDet that the figure comes from the IPC, which assesses food security worldwide and with which the UN cooperates.  On May 12, the IPC issued a statement about acute food insecurity in Gaza.It states regarding emergency aid to Gaza that “immediate action is essential to prevent further deaths, hunger and acute malnutrition, and a move towards famine.”However, it does not say that 14,000 infants will die within two days.To TjekDet, the IPC explains that OCHA's interpretation is inaccurate. Instead, the IPC estimates that 14,100 children in Gaza under the age of five will be at risk of severe acute malnutrition. According to the IPC, this means that they risk dying from malnutrition within the next year if they do not receive treatment, but not within 48 hours, as Tom Fletcher said.Aid agencies have long reported widespread famine in Gaza. And although the UN now acknowledges that Tom Fletcher should have expressed himself differently, they emphasize that the situation in Gaza is critical and that thousands of children are at risk of dying from malnutrition over the next year.CheckDet has asked OCHA why Tom Fletcher sets 48 hours as the limit for emergency aid to arrive on time, when the IPC in their report mentions a period from April 2025 to March 2026.

OCHA later clarified that Fletcher’s wording was misleading, the 14,000 figure refers to infants at risk of severe acute malnutrition, meaning they urgently need help but are not expected to die within two days. The 14,000 figure comes from the IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification), which estimates 14,100 children under five in Gaza at risk of severe acute malnutrition over the next year if untreated, not within 48 hours. The 48-hour timeframe was described as a figure of speech to stress urgency, linked to a temporary aid window permitted by Israel, not a strict deadline for deaths. Media outlets initially reported the claim as imminent deaths within two days but later corrected it to reflect the IPC’s one-year risk estimate.Verdict:False. The claim that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within 48 hours is inaccurate. The correct interpretation is that approximately 14,000 children under five are at severe risk of malnutrition-related death over the coming year without urgent aid.;1. What is the claim being evaluated?That 14,000 infants in Gaza are at risk of dying within 48 hours due to a lack of humanitarian aid.2. Is the claim true, false, or mixed or other relevant category of verdict?False3. Provide a brief explanation for your decision based on the evidence presented in the fact-check:The claim is based on a misstatement by UN OCHA head Tom Fletcher, who inaccurately suggested that 14,000 babies would die within 48 hours without aid. In reality, the figure refers to an IPC estimate of 14,100 children under five at risk of severe acute malnutrition—a condition that increases the risk of death over the course of a year, not within two days. The 48-hour timeframe was used rhetorically to emphasize urgency, not as a literal prediction.;Fact Check: Claim of 14,000 Gaza Infants Dying in 48 Hours is False, Based on Misinterpretation of Malnutrition Risk.;The claim being evaluated is that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within 48 hours if emergency aid does not reach them.The key evidence used to assess this claim includes: Tom Fletcher's statement: The head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), Tom Fletcher, stated on BBC Radio 4 that 14,000 babies will die in the next 48 hours if we can't get to them. OCHA's clarification: Jens Lærke, spokesperson for OCHA, clarified that Fletcher should have said that 14,000 babies are very likely to suffer from severe acute malnutrition, meaning they are in danger of death but not within 48 hours. IPC's assessment: OCHA stated the figure comes from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) partnership. The IPC's May 12 statement on Gaza's acute food insecurity warned of the urgent need to prevent deaths, hunger, and acute malnutrition. IPC's explanation to TjekDet: The IPC explained that OCHA's interpretation was inaccurate. The IPC estimates 14,100 children under five in Gaza are at risk of severe acute malnutrition, meaning they could die from malnutrition within the next year if untreated, not within 48 hours. OCHA's reasoning for 48 hours: Jens Lærke stated that the 48-hour timeframe was a figure of speech to emphasize urgency, given that Israel had communicated a temporary window for aid, not a specific 48-hour deadline. Media corrections: Danish media outlet Ritzau, which initially reported the 48-hour claim, later published a corrected article.The verdict is false. While the situation in Gaza is critical and thousands of children are at risk of severe acute malnutrition and death over the next year, the claim that 14,000 infants will die within 48 hours is incorrect. Tom Fletcher's statement was a miscommunication of the IPC's assessment, which refers to a risk of death over a one-year period for children under five due to severe acute malnutrition, not an immediate 4-hour fatality risk for infants.Claim Being Evaluated: 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within the next 48 hours if emergency aid cannot reach them. This claim was widely reported after a statement by Tom Fletcher, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), on BBC Radio 4.Key Evidence Used to Assess the Claim: OCHA's Clarification: Jens Lærke, spokesperson for OCHA, stated that Tom Fletcher's wording was unclear. He clarified that Fletcher should have said that 14,000 babies are very likely to suffer from severe acute malnutrition. This means that they are in danger of death and urgently need our help. IPC Report: OCHA confirmed the figure comes from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), which assesses food security. The IPC's statement from May 12 about acute food insecurity in Gaza indicates that immediate action is essential to prevent further deaths, hunger and acute malnutrition, and a move towards famine. IPC's Correction: The IPC itself explained that OCHA's interpretation was inaccurate. The IPC estimates that 14,100 children in Gaza under the age of five are at risk of severe acute malnutrition, meaning they risk dying from malnutrition within the next year if they do not receive treatment, not within 48 hours. 48-hour timeframe: Jens Lærke of OCHA clarified that the 48 hours was a figure of speech used to emphasize urgency, given that Israel had communicated a temporary window for aid, not a specific deadline.Verdict: False.While the humanitarian situation in Gaza is indeed critical and thousands of children are at risk of dying from malnutrition, the specific claim that 14,000 infants would die within 48 hours is incorrect. The figure refers to children under five years old at risk of severe acute malnutrition over the course of a year, and the 48-hour timeframe was a rhetorical device to emphasize urgency, not a literal prediction.

Is the claim true, false, or mixed or other relevant category of verdict?False.3. Provide a brief explanation for your decision based on the evidence presented in the fact-check.The claim is false because OCHA (the UN office from which the figure originated) clarified that its head, Tom Fletcher, misstated the information. He should have said that 14,000 children under five years old are at risk of severe acute malnutrition and thus are in danger of death, but over the course of the next year, not within 48 hours.

But TjekDets research shows that there is no indication that the popular burger has shrunk in recent decades. ;This is the fact to chek: A sure winner among hangover-stricken Danes on January 1st is McDonalds - and many probably swear by one of their signature burgers - the Big Mac. But would you have been fuller if you had sunk your teeth into a Big Mac back in the 1980s? At least that's what several posts on Facebook claim, which are currently being seen by thousands of users. The posts claim that the burger has shrunk significantly in size , while at the same time increasing significantly in price . The claim is widespread in both Danish and English Facebook posts . One of the English posts has 29,000 shares , while another has been shared more than 9,000 times . Some of the posts claim that the burger has become 40 percent smaller . As documentation, many of the posts use the same image, which shows two Big Macs. One is supposedly from the 1980s, while the other is from 2024. If the image is to be believed, then there is a significant size difference. This image is repeated in numerous posts, where it is claimed that McDonald's Big Mac has shrunk significantly since the happy 80s (Photo: Screenshot of Facebook). But while it might take two Big Macs to cure your hangover today, it wouldn't have been any different in the 1980s According to TjekDet's research, there is no indication that the Big Mac has shrunk since the 1980s. However, it has increased in price - although not very much if you take inflation into account. The price increase According to an article from the Pennsylvania Center for the Book, the Big Mac was first introduced in the 1960s by Jim Delligatti, who owned a number of McDonald's restaurants in Pittsburgh, USA. In 1968, the Big Mac was added to the menu at all McDonald's restaurants in the United States. And the price? It was 45 cents. If you use an inflation converter to calculate what 45 cents in 1968 is worth today, the answer is just over $4. Today, a Big Mac in the USA costs $5.69 - equivalent to just over 40 Danish kroner, while the normal price in Denmark is 39 kroner for one of the popular burgers. From country to country, there is virtually no difference in what a Big Mac looks like. That is why the media outlet “The Economist” has published  the “Big Mac Index” since 1986 as a way to compare price levels across borders and currencies. In 2024,  “The Economist” has calculated that Switzerland will have the world's most expensive Big Mac with a price of $8.17 - equivalent to about 58 Danish kroner. But what about the size? The price is one thing, but what happened to the size of the Big Mac? Some of the posts on social media claim that the burger has become 40 percent smaller since 1980. If you ask McDonald's press department in Denmark, they flatly deny that the Big Mac has changed size. “The size of Big Mac's has not changed since McDonald's came to Denmark in 1981. We are not allowed to do that at all,” says Mads Jensen, a communications officer at McDonald's. Today, McDonald's Danish website states that a Big Mac contains 510 calories. If you look at the American version , it contains 590 calories. But on neither the Danish nor the American website can you see how much a Big Mac weighs. Therefore, TjekDet bought three Big Mac's at three different McDonald's restaurants in Copenhagen and here the weight was 200 grams, 206 grams and 222 grams. By using the Wayback Machine, which is an internet archiving tool, TjekDet has managed to find the content description for a Big Mac in Denmark back in 2001 . Back then, a Big Mac weighed 209 grams and contained 2137 kJ, which corresponds to 511 calories. In terms of both weight and calories, the Big Mac is basically the same today as it was more than 20 years ago, so you shouldn't feel cheated when you sink your teeth into a Big Mac in 2025. However, the number of calories has varied a little. In 2019, McDonald's website stated that there were 503 calories in a Big Mac, while in 2022 there were 487 calories - and as previously mentioned - today there are 510 calories in one of the popular burgers.  In 2020, McDonald's in Denmark had a turnover of 2.7 billion kroner, McDonald's writes on its own website. Photo: Shutterstock More calories in Everything is bigger in the USA sounds like a cool phrase, but when it comes to Big Macs, there isn't much difference between Denmark and the USA. For Big Macs in the US, there are significantly more content designations to dig up than in recent decades, and there is nothing to suggest that the Big Mac has shrunk in size. The biggest difference from Denmark is the number of calories, which is generally higher in the US than in Denmark. In 1996 we can see that there were 530 calories in an American Big Mac , so there are actually more calories in the burger in 2025 than back then - namely 590 calories. In 2003, we can see that the burger weighed 216 grams, which is roughly consistent with the results that TjekDet obtained. Even though we can't go back any further than 1996 for the USA and 2001 for Denmark, there is no documentation that the popular burger has become smaller.;Vanilla;Big Mac Has Not Shrunk Since the 1980s — Social Media Claim Proven False;No evidence of shrinkage: Despite widespread social media claims and images suggesting the Big Mac has become significantly smaller since the 1980s, McDonald's Denmark confirms the size has not changed since they started serving it in 1981. Weights from different years and recent purchases show consistent burger sizes around 200–220 grams. Price increase aligned with inflation: The Big Mac's price has risen over time but not disproportionately when inflation is considered. For example, the 1968 US price of 45 cents equates to just over \$4 today, while current prices are around \$5.69 in the US and about 39 DKK in Denmark. Calorie content fairly stable, with US having slightly more: The calorie count of a Big Mac in Denmark has hovered around 500 calories over the years, with slight fluctuations, while in the US it has increased from 530 calories in 1996 to about 590 calories today.;The verdict for the fact-check is False.The claim that the Big Mac has shrunk significantly (by around 40%) since the 1980s is not supported by evidence.

While the price has increased, it aligns with inflation, and calorie content has stayed relatively stable.;McDonald's Big Mac Hasn't Shrunk Since the 80s, Fact-Check Finds; Size: Claims that the Big Mac has significantly shrunk since the 1980s are false. McDonald's Denmark denies any size change, and data from 2001 (Denmark) and 2003 (USA) shows the weight and calorie content are consistent with today's Big Macs. In fact, the US Big Mac currently has more calories (590) than it did in 1996 (530). Price: The price of a Big Mac has increased over time. In 1968, it cost 45 cents in the US, which translates to just over $4 today when adjusted for inflation. A Big Mac in the US now costs $5.69, and 39 DKK in Denmark. Consistency: The Big Mac's appearance is largely consistent across countries, as highlighted by The Economist's Big Mac Index, which has been used to compare price levels globally since 1986.;Verdict: False;Big Mac Shrinking Claim is a False Bite;The claim that McDonald's Big Mac has shrunk significantly in size since the 1980s is false, research found no indication of a size change.The price of a Big Mac has increased over time, but when adjusted for inflation, the increase is not significant.The weight and calorie content of a Big Mac have remained largely consistent over the past 20-30 years, with some minor variations in calorie count.Meta AI response: Here are three bullet points summarizing the fact-check: The claim that McDonald's Big Mac has shrunk significantly in size since the 1980s is false, research found no indication of a size change.

The claim about a price increase is partially true but overstated when inflation is considered, as the price rise is modest in real terms.

In 2020, McDonald's in Denmark had a turnover of 2.7 billion kroner, McDonald's writes on its own website. Photo: Shutterstock More calories in Everything is bigger in the USA sounds like a cool phrase, but when it comes to Big Macs, there isn't much difference between Denmark and the USA. For Big Macs in the US, there are significantly more content designations to dig up than in recent decades, and there is nothing to suggest that the Big Mac has shrunk in size. The biggest difference from Denmark is the number of calories, which is generally higher in the US than in Denmark. In 1996 we can see that there were 530 calories in an American Big Mac , so there are actually more calories in the burger in 2025 than back then - namely 590 calories. In 2003, we can see that the burger weighed 216 grams, which is roughly consistent with the results that TjekDet obtained. Even though we can't go back any further than 1996 for the USA and 2001 for Denmark, there is no documentation that the popular burger has become smaller.;Chain-of-Thought;Fact-Check: McDonald’s Big Mac Has Not Shrunk Since the 1980s—Size Remains Consistent Despite Price Changes;1. Claim Being EvaluatedThe core claim is that McDonald's Big Mac has significantly shrunk in size (by as much as 40%) since the 1980s, while its price has increased substantially. This claim is widespread on social media, supported by images comparing an allegedly larger 1980s Big Mac with a smaller 2024 version.---2. Main Evidence ExaminedSocial Media Posts: Several Facebook posts show side-by-side images of two Big Macs, one purportedly from the 1980s and one from 2024, claiming the burger has shrunk dramatically.McDonald's Official Statement: The Danish McDonald’s press department denies any size change since their arrival in Denmark in 1981, stating it is not allowed to alter the size.Weight and Calorie Data:TjekDet purchased Big Macs in 2024 weighing between 200g and 222g.Historical data from 2001 shows a Big Mac weighed 209g with 511 calories in Denmark.U.S. data from 2003 shows a weight of 216g.Calorie counts have fluctuated but generally remain consistent, with recent Danish Big Macs around 510 calories and American versions around 590 calories.Price Data:The original 1968 U.S. Big Mac price was \$0.45 (\~\$4 in 2024 dollars).Current U.S. Big Mac price is about \$5.69.Danish Big Mac costs around 39 kroner, comparable to U.S. prices when adjusted for inflation.The “Big Mac Index” by The Economist shows international price variation but no link to size change.---3. Verdict and ReasoningVerdict: The claim that the Big Mac has shrunk by 40% since the 1980s is false.Reasoning:McDonald's official statement and regulations prohibit size changes.Verified weight and calorie data from multiple sources show that the Big Mac’s size has remained largely consistent over decades.Price has increased over time, but mainly due to inflation and market differences, not size reduction.The viral image comparing two burgers likely misrepresents or exaggerates differences in size, not backed by factual data.;Absolutely! Here’s the verdict determination following those exact steps:--- 1. Claim Being EvaluatedThe claim is that the McDonald's Big Mac burger has shrunk significantly in size—by about 40%—since the 1980s, while its price has increased substantially.--- 2. Key Evidence Reviewed Social media posts and images claim a smaller Big Mac now compared to the 1980s, suggesting a large reduction in size. McDonald's Denmark press office denies any size changes since 1981, stating it is not allowed to alter the burger’s size. Actual measurements taken in 2024 show Big Macs weighing about 200–222 grams. Archived data from 2001 and 2003 shows Big Macs weighing roughly 209g (Denmark) and 216g (USA), very close to current weights. Calorie counts have fluctuated slightly but remain in the same range, supporting consistent portion sizes. Price comparisons indicate increases, but when adjusted for inflation, the price rise is moderate and not evidence of shrinking size.--- 3. Verdict and JustificationVerdict: FalseThe claim that the Big Mac has shrunk by 40% since the 1980s is false. Verified weights and calorie data from multiple points in time show the Big Mac’s size has remained relatively stable over the decades. McDonald’s official stance and regulatory constraints support that the burger size has not been reduced. Price increases reflect inflation and market conditions, not a reduction in burger size.---Would you like me to help you write this in a particular style or format?;Big Mac Shrinkage Claims Debunked: Burger Size Consistent Since 80s, Price Rise Modest with Inflation;1. Claim Being Evaluated: The core claim being evaluated is that McDonald's Big Mac burger has significantly shrunk in size (some posts claiming by 40%) since the 1980s, while at the same time increasing significantly in price. This claim is widespread on social media, often using an image comparing a supposed 1980s Big Mac with a 2024 one.2. Main Evidence Provided: Size: McDonald's Denmark press department flatly denies any change in Big Mac size since their arrival in Denmark in 1981, stating they are not allowed to do that at all. Weight (Denmark): TjekDet purchased three Big Macs in Copenhagen, which weighed 200 grams, 206 grams, and 222 grams. Weight;1. Claim Being Evaluated: The central claim is that McDonald's Big Mac burger has shrunk significantly in size (with some posts specifying a 40% reduction) since the 1980s, while simultaneously having increased significantly in price.2. Key Evidence Provided to Assess the Claim: Size: McDonald's Denmark explicitly states that The size of Big Mac's has not changed since McDonald's came to Denmark in 1981. TjekDet's own measurement of three current Big Macs in Copenhagen showed weights of 200 grams, 206 grams, and 222 grams. Archived data from 2001 for Denmark shows a Big Mac weighed 209 grams and contained 511 calories, which is consistent with the current Danish Big Mac (510 calories). Archived data from 1996 for the USA shows an American Big Mac had 530 calories, while today it has 590 calories, indicating an increase in calories. In 2003, an American Big Mac weighed 216 grams, which is consistent with current findings. The article explicitly states: there is no indication that the Big Mac has shrunk since the 1980s. And there is no documentation that the popular burger has become smaller. Price: In 1968, a Big Mac cost 45 cents in the US. Adjusted for inflation, this would be just over $4 today. Today, a Big Mac in the US costs $5.69, and in Denmark, it costs 39 kroner (approx. $5.50). While the nominal price has increased, the text notes it's although not very much if you take inflation into account.3. Verdict: False.The claim that the McDonald's Big Mac has shrunk significantly in size since the 1980s is false. Evidence from both McDonald's official statements and historical nutritional data for Denmark and the USA consistently shows that the Big Mac's size, weight, and calorie content have remained remarkably consistent over decades. In some instances (e.g., US calorie count), the burger actually contains more calories now than in the past.Regarding the price, while the nominal price has increased, the fact-check clarifies that the increase is not very much if you take inflation into account, contradicting the significantly increased in price part of the claim when viewed in real terms.;Claim That Big Mac Has Shrunk Significantly in Size Since the 1980s is False;Step 1: Identify and Explain the Claim The claim being evaluated is that the Big Mac has shrunk significantly in size since the 1980s while increasing in price. Some social media posts specifically claim that the burger has become 40% smaller. Step 2: Examine the Main Evidence The main evidence provided includes: An image comparing two Big Macs, one supposedly from the 1980s and one from 2024, showing a significant size difference. Research by TjekDet finding no indication that the Big Mac has shrunk since the 1980s. McDonald's press department in Denmark denying any change in the size of the Big Mac since 1981. Weight measurements of Big Macs purchased in Copenhagen (200g, 206g, and 222g) compared to archived content descriptions from 2001 (209g). Calorie comparisons between the Danish and American versions of the Big Mac, with some variation over the years but no significant decrease. Step 3: Conclude with the Verdict The verdict is that there is no documentation to support the claim that the Big Mac has shrunk in size since the 1980s. While the price has increased, this is not disproportionate when adjusted for inflation. McDonald's denies any size change, and weight and calorie comparisons over the years show consistency, with some minor variations in calorie count. The significant difference claimed in social media posts is not supported by the evidence presented. The final answer is: The claim that the Big Mac has shrunk significantly in size since the 1980s is false.;Step 1: Identify the ClaimThe claim being evaluated is that the Big Mac has shrunk significantly in size since the 1980s, with some posts claiming it has become 40% smaller, while also increasing in price.Step 2: Review the Key EvidenceKey evidence includes:McDonald's denial of any size change since 1981 in Denmark.Weight measurements of current Big Macs (ranging from 200g to 222g) compared to an archived description from 2001 (209g), showing consistency.Calorie comparisons over the years, with minor variations but no significant decrease.Price increase comparison, showing that while the price has gone up, it's not disproportionate when adjusted for inflation.Step 3: Determine the VerdictBased on the evidence, the verdict is that the claim is False. The evidence does not support the assertion that the Big Mac has shrunk significantly in size since the 1980s. McDonald's statements and the comparison of weights and calories over the years indicate that the size of the Big Mac has remained essentially the same. While there has been a price increase, this is accounted for by inflation.

While there has been a price increase, this is accounted for by inflation. Therefore, the claim of a significant size reduction is not supported by the facts.;No Shrinkage: McDonald's Big Mac Size Unchanged Since 1980s, Despite Social Media Claims;1. Claim Being EvaluatedThe claim being fact-checked is that McDonald's Big Mac has significantly shrunk in size since the 1980s, with some social media posts asserting it has become 40 percent smaller, while its price has significantly increased. This claim is supported by an image circulating on social media, purportedly showing a larger Big Mac from the 1980s compared to a smaller one from 2024.2. Main Evidence ProvidedThe fact-check uses multiple sources to evaluate the claim:- McDonald's Official Statement: McDonald's Denmark press department, through communications officer Mads Jensen, denies any size reduction, stating that the Big Mac's size has remained unchanged since McDonald's entered Denmark in 1981.- Weight Measurements: TjekDet purchased three Big Macs from different McDonald's restaurants in Copenhagen in 2024, with weights of 200 grams, 206 grams, and 222 grams, averaging around 209 grams. Using the Wayback Machine, they found that in 2001, a Big Mac in Denmark weighed 209 grams, indicating no significant change in weight over time.- Calorie Content: The calorie content of a Big Mac in Denmark is reported as 510 calories in 2024, compared to 511 calories in 2001, 503 calories in 2019, and 487 calories in 2022, showing minor fluctuations but no consistent trend of reduction. In the U.S., a Big Mac contained 530 calories in 1996 and 590 calories in 2024, suggesting an increase rather than a decrease in size or caloric content.- U.S. Data: Historical data from the U.S. shows a Big Mac weighed 216 grams in 2003, consistent with the 2024 Danish measurements, further supporting the claim that the size has not significantly changed.- Price Analysis: The price of a Big Mac in 1968 was 45 cents in the U.S., equivalent to about $4 in 2024 after adjusting for inflation. Today’s U.S. price is $5.69, and in Denmark, it’s 39 kroner (approximately $5.50). While prices have increased, the rise is modest when adjusted for inflation.- Big Mac Index: The Economist’s Big Mac Index, published since 1986, indicates consistent composition across countries, supporting the idea that the Big Mac’s recipe and size are standardized globally.- Lack of Historical Evidence: No documentation from the 1980s or earlier was found to confirm the claim of a larger Big Mac, and the image used in social media posts lacks verifiable authenticity.3. Verdict and JustificationVerdict: The claim that the Big Mac has shrunk significantly since the 1980s is false.Justification: The fact-check finds no evidence to support the claim of a 40 percent size reduction. Weight and calorie data from 2001 (Denmark) and 1996; Fact-Check Verdict Determination 1. Claim Being EvaluatedThe claim is that McDonald's Big Mac has significantly shrunk in size since the 1980s, with some social media posts asserting it has become 40 percent smaller, while its price has significantly increased. This is accompanied by an image purportedly showing a larger Big Mac from the 1980s compared to a smaller one from 2024. 2. Key Evidence Provided- McDonald's Statement: McDonald's Denmark, via communications officer Mads Jensen, states that the Big Mac's size has not changed since McDonald's entered Denmark in 1981.- Weight Data: In 2024, TjekDet measured three Big Macs in Copenhagen, weighing 200 grams, 206 grams, and 222 grams (average ~209 grams). In 2001, a Big Mac in Denmark weighed 209 grams (per Wayback Machine data). In the U.S., a Big Mac weighed 216 grams in 2003, consistent with current measurements.- Calorie Data: In Denmark, a Big Mac had 511 calories in 2001, 503 in 2019, 487 in 2022, and 510 in 2024, showing minor fluctuations. In the U.S., it had 530 calories in 1996 and 590 in 2024, suggesting no reduction in size.- Price Data: In 1968, a U.S. Big Mac cost 45 cents (~$4 in 2024 after inflation adjustment). Today, it costs $5.69 in the U.S. and 39 kroner (~$5.50) in Denmark, indicating a modest price increase when adjusted for inflation.- Big Mac Index: The Economist’s Big Mac Index (since 1986) confirms standardized composition across countries, supporting size consistency.- Social Media Image: The image claiming a size difference lacks verifiable authenticity or origin.- Historical Data Limitations: No direct data from the 1980s was found, but data from 1996 (U.S.) and 2001 (Denmark) aligns with current measurements. 3. Verdict and JustificationVerdict: FalseJustification: The claim that the Big Mac has shrunk significantly (e.g., by 40 percent) since the 1980s is not supported by evidence. Weight measurements from 2001 (Denmark) and 2003 (U.S.) are nearly identical to 2024 measurements, and calorie data shows no consistent decline, with U.S. calories increasing from 530 (1996) to 590 (2024). McDonald's official statement denies any size change since 1981. The social media image lacks credibility due to unverified origins. While prices have risen, inflation-adjusted increases are modest, undermining the claim of significant price hikes relative to size. The Big Mac Index further supports global size consistency. Minor calorie variations are likely due to nutritional reporting or ingredient tweaks, not size reduction. Without 1980s data, the claim cannot be directly disproven for that decade, but all available evidence from 1996 onward contradicts it, rendering the claim false.
FC_11;Bullet point summary;; Several viral posts on social media claim that the McDonald's Big Mac has shrunk by 40 percent since 1980.      A picture of a Big Mac, supposedly from the 1980s, is used as documentation.      But TjekDets research shows that there is no indication that the popular burger has shrunk in recent decades. ;This is the fact to chek: A sure winner among hangover-stricken Danes on January 1st is McDonalds - and many probably swear by one of their signature burgers - the Big Mac. But would you have been fuller if you had sunk your teeth into a Big Mac back in the 1980s? At least that's what several posts on Facebook claim, which are currently being seen by thousands of users. The posts claim that the burger has shrunk significantly in size , while at the same time increasing significantly in price . The claim is widespread in both Danish and English Facebook posts . One of the English posts has 29,000 shares , while another has been shared more than 9,000 times . Some of the posts claim that the burger has become 40 percent smaller . As documentation, many of the posts use the same image, which shows two Big Macs. One is supposedly from the 1980s, while the other is from 2024. If the image is to be believed, then there is a significant size difference. This image is repeated in numerous posts, where it is claimed that McDonald's Big Mac has shrunk significantly since the happy 80s (Photo: Screenshot of Facebook). But while it might take two Big Macs to cure your hangover today, it wouldn't have been any different in the 1980s According to TjekDet's research, there is no indication that the Big Mac has shrunk since the 1980s. However, it has increased in price - although not very much if you take inflation into account. The price increase According to an article from the Pennsylvania Center for the Book, the Big Mac was first introduced in the 1960s by Jim Delligatti, who owned a number of McDonald's restaurants in Pittsburgh, USA. In 1968, the Big Mac was added to the menu at all McDonald's restaurants in the United States. And the price? It was 45 cents. If you use an inflation converter to calculate what 45 cents in 1968 is worth today, the answer is just over $4. Today, a Big Mac in the USA costs $5.69 - equivalent to just over 40 Danish kroner, while the normal price in Denmark is 39 kroner for one of the popular burgers. From country to country, there is virtually no difference in what a Big Mac looks like. That is why the media outlet “The Economist” has published  the “Big Mac Index” since 1986 as a way to compare price levels across borders and currencies. In 2024,  “The Economist” has calculated that Switzerland will have the world's most expensive Big Mac with a price of $8.17 - equivalent to about 58 Danish kroner. But what about the size? The price is one thing, but what happened to the size of the Big Mac? Some of the posts on social media claim that the burger has become 40 percent smaller since 1980. If you ask McDonald's press department in Denmark, they flatly deny that the Big Mac has changed size. “The size of Big Mac's has not changed since McDonald's came to Denmark in 1981. We are not allowed to do that at all,” says Mads Jensen, a communications officer at McDonald's. Today, McDonald's Danish website states that a Big Mac contains 510 calories. If you look at the American version , it contains 590 calories. But on neither the Danish nor the American website can you see how much a Big Mac weighs. Therefore, TjekDet bought three Big Mac's at three different McDonald's restaurants in Copenhagen and here the weight was 200 grams, 206 grams and 222 grams. By using the Wayback Machine, which is an internet archiving tool, TjekDet has managed to find the content description for a Big Mac in Denmark back in 2001 . Back then, a Big Mac weighed 209 grams and contained 2137 kJ, which corresponds to 511 calories. In terms of both weight and calories, the Big Mac is basically the same today as it was more than 20 years ago, so you shouldn't feel cheated when you sink your teeth into a Big Mac in 2025. However, the number of calories has varied a little. In 2019, McDonald's website stated that there were 503 calories in a Big Mac, while in 2022 there were 487 calories - and as previously mentioned - today there are 510 calories in one of the popular burgers.  In 2020, McDonald's in Denmark had a turnover of 2.7 billion kroner, McDonald's writes on its own website.

The claim:Social media posts widely claim that the McDonald’s Big Mac has significantly shrunk in size since the 1980s—by as much as 40%—while its price has increased substantially.2. The evidence:Many posts use an image comparing two Big Macs (one from the 1980s and one from 2024) to suggest a noticeable size difference.McDonald’s Denmark denies any size change, stating it’s not allowed to alter the Big Mac’s size since their arrival in Denmark in 1981.Testing of current Big Macs in Copenhagen found weights around 200–222 grams.Archived data from 2001 shows the Big Mac weighed 209 grams with roughly the same calorie content, indicating consistency over 20+ years.In the US, data from 1996 and 2003 also shows similar weights and calories, with no evidence of shrinkage.Prices have increased but align reasonably with inflation adjustments (e.g., 45 cents in 1968 equals about \$4 today, current US price is \$5.69).The “Big Mac Index” by The Economist confirms size consistency globally, with price variations reflecting local economies.3. The verdict:The claim that the Big Mac has shrunk significantly since the 1980s is false. Evidence from McDonald’s, archival data, and recent measurements show the burger’s size and weight have remained essentially the same, though prices have increased moderately when adjusted for inflation.;Certainly! Here’s the final verdict based on the fact-check:---1. Claim being assessed:The claim is that McDonald’s Big Mac has shrunk significantly in size—by about 40%—since the 1980s, while its price has increased substantially.2. Verdict:False.3. Reasoning;Fact Check: Claims of Shrunken Big Macs Since the 1980s and Soaring Prices are False;1. The Claim: Social media posts claim that McDonald's Big Mac has significantly shrunk in size (by as much as 40%) since the 1980s, while its price has significantly increased. Many posts use a comparison image of a 1980s Big Mac and a 2024 Big Mac to support the size claim.2. The Evidence: Size: McDonald's Denmark denies any change in Big Mac size since its introduction to Denmark in 1981. TjekDet's own measurements of three Big Macs in Copenhagen showed weights between 200g and 222g. Historical data from 2001 (Denmark) shows a Big Mac weighing 209g and containing 511 calories, which is consistent with today's 510 calories. For the US, 1996 data shows 530 calories, and today it's 590 calories, indicating an increase in calories. A 2003 US Big Mac weighed 216g. No documentation suggests the burger has become smaller. Price: In 1968, a Big Mac in the US cost 45 cents, which is equivalent to just over $4 today when adjusted for inflation. Today, a Big Mac in the US costs $5.69, and in Denmark, it's 39 kroner (approximately $5.49). While the price has increased in nominal terms, it hasn't increased significantly when inflation is considered. The Big Mac Index from The Economist has been used since 1986 to compare price levels, with current prices varying by country (e.g., Switzerland has the most expensive at $8.17).3. The Verdict: False. There is no indication that the Big Mac has shrunk in size since the 1980s. While its nominal price has increased, this increase is not significant when inflation is taken into account.;1. The claim being assessed:The claim is that McDonald's Big Mac burgers have significantly shrunk in size (some posts specify by 40%) since the 1980s, while at the same time increasing significantly in price.2. The verdict:False.3. What reasoning or evidence supports this decision?The fact-check provides strong evidence to refute both parts of the claim: Regarding size: McDonald's press department in Denmark explicitly denies any change in the Big Mac's size since McDonald's arrived in Denmark in 1981. TjekDet's own physical measurements of Big Macs purchased in Copenhagen (200g, 206g, and 222g) are consistent with historical data from 2001 (209g) and 2003 (216g for US). Calorie counts also support consistency: a Danish Big Mac currently contains 510 calories, very close to the 511 calories in 2001. For the US, the calorie count has actually increased from 530 in 1996 to 590 currently, further disproving shrinkage. The widely circulated image showing a significant size difference is not supported by actual data or McDonald's statements. Regarding price: While the nominal price has increased (e.g., from 45 cents in 1968 to $5.69 today in the USA), when adjusted for inflation, the increase is not very much. 45 cents in 1968 is equivalent to just over $4 today. The Big Mac Index, published by The Economist since 1986, is a recognized tool for comparing price levels across countries, and it also doesn't indicate an exorbitant, inflation-unadjusted price surge over decades.;Claim That Big Mac Has Shrunk Significantly in Size Since 1980s Is False;The Claim: Social media posts claim that the Big Mac has significantly shrunk in size since the 1980s while increasing in price. Some posts specifically claim the burger has become 40% smaller. The Evidence: An image circulating on Facebook compares a Big Mac from the 1980s to one from 2024, showing a significant size difference. McDonald's press department in Denmark denies any size change since 1981. TjekDet's research found the weight of a Big Mac in Denmark to be around 200-222 grams, consistent with archived content descriptions from 2001 (209 grams). Calorie counts have varied slightly over the years but remain largely consistent (511 calories in 2001 vs 510 calories today in Denmark, and 530 calories in 1996 vs 590 calories today in the US). The Verdict: False. There is no indication that the Big Mac has shrunk in size since the 1980s. While prices have increased, adjusting for inflation shows it's not a significant change. The size and calorie count of the Big Mac have remained largely consistent over the years, based on available data and McDonald's statements.;Here is the final verdict based on the fact-check:The Claim: The claim being assessed is that the Big Mac has significantly shrunk in size since the 1980s, with some posts specifically claiming it has become 40% smaller, while also increasing in price.The Verdict: False.Reasoning;Big Mac Size Shrunk 40% Since 1980s? False, but Price Increase Partially True, Fact-Check Finds;1. The Claim: Social media posts, widely shared on platforms like Facebook, assert that McDonald's Big Mac has shrunk significantly in size since the 1980s, with some claiming a 40% reduction, while its price has increased substantially. These claims are often accompanied by an image comparing a supposedly larger Big Mac from the 1980s to a smaller one from 2024.2. The Evidence:- Size: McDonald's Denmark denies any size reduction since entering the market in 1981. TjekDet's investigation found that Big Macs purchased in Copenhagen in 2024 weighed 200, 206, and 222 grams, closely aligning with a 2001 archived record showing a Big Mac weighing 209 grams with 511 calories. Current Danish Big Macs have 510 calories, and U.S. Big Macs have 590 calories (up from 530 in 1996). A 2003 U.S. Big Mac weighed 216 grams, consistent with current measurements. No evidence supports a significant size reduction.- Price: In 1968, a U.S. Big Mac cost 45 cents, equivalent to about $4 today after inflation adjustment. In 2024, it costs $5.69 in the U.S. and 39 kroner (approx. $5.60) in Denmark. The price has increased but aligns closely with inflation.- Sources: TjekDet's research, McDonald's Denmark, U.S. nutritional data, Wayback Machine archives, and The Economist’s Big Mac Index.3. The Verdict: The claim is false regarding the size reduction and partially true regarding the price increase. No evidence supports the assertion that the Big Mac has shrunk significantly since the 1980s, weight and calorie data indicate consistency over time. The price has risen, but when adjusted for inflation, the increase is minimal, refuting claims of a substantial price hike.;1. Claim Being Assessed: Social media posts claim that McDonald's Big Mac has shrunk significantly in size since the 1980s, with some specifying a 40% reduction, and that its price has increased substantially. These claims are supported by an image comparing a purportedly larger Big Mac from the 1980s to a smaller one from 2024.2. Verdict: The claim is false regarding the size reduction and partially true regarding the price increase.3. Reasoning and Evidence:- Size Reduction: McDonald's Denmark states that the Big Mac size has not changed since 1981. TjekDet's measurements of Big Macs in Copenhagen in 2024 (200, 206, and 222 grams) align closely with a 2001 record of 209 grams and 511 calories, and current Danish Big Macs have 510 calories. In the U.S., a 2003 Big Mac weighed 216 grams, and current ones have 590 calories (up from 530 in 1996). No historical data supports a 40% size reduction, and weight and calorie counts remain consistent over time.- Price Increase: In 1968, a U.S. Big Mac cost 45 cents, equivalent to about $4 today after inflation. In 2024, it costs $5.69 in the U.S. and 39 kroner (approx. $5.60) in Denmark. While the nominal price has increased, it aligns closely with inflation, indicating the price hike is not as significant as claimed.- The lack of evidence for size reduction and the inflation-adjusted price data refute the core claims, with the price increase being modest and expected over time.
FC_11;Bullet point summary;; Several viral posts on social media claim that the McDonald's Big Mac has shrunk by 40 percent since 1980.      A picture of a Big Mac, supposedly from the 1980s, is used as documentation.      But TjekDets research shows that there is no indication that the popular burger has shrunk in recent decades. ;This is the fact to chek: A sure winner among hangover-stricken Danes on January 1st is McDonalds - and many probably swear by one of their signature burgers - the Big Mac. But would you have been fuller if you had sunk your teeth into a Big Mac back in the 1980s? At least that's what several posts on Facebook claim, which are currently being seen by thousands of users. The posts claim that the burger has shrunk significantly in size , while at the same time increasing significantly in price . The claim is widespread in both Danish and English Facebook posts . One of the English posts has 29,000 shares , while another has been shared more than 9,000 times . Some of the posts claim that the burger has become 40 percent smaller . As documentation, many of the posts use the same image, which shows two Big Macs. One is supposedly from the 1980s, while the other is from 2024. If the image is to be believed, then there is a significant size difference. This image is repeated in numerous posts, where it is claimed that McDonald's Big Mac has shrunk significantly since the happy 80s (Photo: Screenshot of Facebook). But while it might take two Big Macs to cure your hangover today, it wouldn't have been any different in the 1980s According to TjekDet's research, there is no indication that the Big Mac has shrunk since the 1980s. However, it has increased in price - although not very much if you take inflation into account. The price increase According to an article from the Pennsylvania Center for the Book, the Big Mac was first introduced in the 1960s by Jim Delligatti, who owned a number of McDonald's restaurants in Pittsburgh, USA. In 1968, the Big Mac was added to the menu at all McDonald's restaurants in the United States. And the price? It was 45 cents. If you use an inflation converter to calculate what 45 cents in 1968 is worth today, the answer is just over $4. Today, a Big Mac in the USA costs $5.69 - equivalent to just over 40 Danish kroner, while the normal price in Denmark is 39 kroner for one of the popular burgers. From country to country, there is virtually no difference in what a Big Mac looks like. That is why the media outlet “The Economist” has published  the “Big Mac Index” since 1986 as a way to compare price levels across borders and currencies. In 2024,  “The Economist” has calculated that Switzerland will have the world's most expensive Big Mac with a price of $8.17 - equivalent to about 58 Danish kroner. But what about the size? The price is one thing, but what happened to the size of the Big Mac? Some of the posts on social media claim that the burger has become 40 percent smaller since 1980. If you ask McDonald's press department in Denmark, they flatly deny that the Big Mac has changed size. “The size of Big Mac's has not changed since McDonald's came to Denmark in 1981. We are not allowed to do that at all,” says Mads Jensen, a communications officer at McDonald's. Today, McDonald's Danish website states that a Big Mac contains 510 calories. If you look at the American version , it contains 590 calories. But on neither the Danish nor the American website can you see how much a Big Mac weighs. Therefore, TjekDet bought three Big Mac's at three different McDonald's restaurants in Copenhagen and here the weight was 200 grams, 206 grams and 222 grams. By using the Wayback Machine, which is an internet archiving tool, TjekDet has managed to find the content description for a Big Mac in Denmark back in 2001 . Back then, a Big Mac weighed 209 grams and contained 2137 kJ, which corresponds to 511 calories. In terms of both weight and calories, the Big Mac is basically the same today as it was more than 20 years ago, so you shouldn't feel cheated when you sink your teeth into a Big Mac in 2025. However, the number of calories has varied a little. In 2019, McDonald's website stated that there were 503 calories in a Big Mac, while in 2022 there were 487 calories - and as previously mentioned - today there are 510 calories in one of the popular burgers.  In 2020, McDonald's in Denmark had a turnover of 2.7 billion kroner, McDonald's writes on its own website. Photo: Shutterstock More calories in Everything is bigger in the USA sounds like a cool phrase, but when it comes to Big Macs, there isn't much difference between Denmark and the USA. For Big Macs in the US, there are significantly more content designations to dig up than in recent decades, and there is nothing to suggest that the Big Mac has shrunk in size. The biggest difference from Denmark is the number of calories, which is generally higher in the US than in Denmark. In 1996 we can see that there were 530 calories in an American Big Mac , so there are actually more calories in the burger in 2025 than back then - namely 590 calories. In 2003, we can see that the burger weighed 216 grams, which is roughly consistent with the results that TjekDet obtained. Even though we can't go back any further than 1996 for the USA and 2001 for Denmark, there is no documentation that the popular burger has become smaller.;Least-to-most ;Fact-Check: McDonald’s Big Mac Has Not Shrunk Since the 1980s Despite Price Increases;The claim that McDonald’s Big Mac has shrunk by about 40% since the 1980s, despite rising prices, has been widely shared on social media. However, a detailed fact-check reveals that this claim is false. McDonald’s Denmark confirms that the size of the Big Mac has not changed since their introduction in 1981, and independent weight measurements of Big Macs purchased in Copenhagen today align closely with documented weights from 2001. Caloric content has remained relatively stable, and historical US data shows no evidence of size reduction either. While the price of the Big Mac has increased over time, this increase is moderate when adjusted for inflation. The viral image used as evidence in many posts is misleading and does not accurately represent the product’s size. Therefore, the popular belief that the Big Mac has shrunk significantly is not supported by the available evidence.;Certainly! Here’s the verdict breakdown:1. What is the claim being evaluated?The claim is that McDonald’s Big Mac has shrunk significantly in size (by about 40%) since the 1980s, while its price has increased considerably.2. Based on the evidence provided, is the claim true, false, mixed, or another verdict category?The claim is false.3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict? McDonald’s Denmark confirms the Big Mac size has not changed since 1981. Current Big Macs weigh between 200-222 grams, consistent with documented weights from 2001 and early 2000s US data. Caloric values have remained relatively stable over time. Price increases are reasonable when adjusted for inflation. The viral image comparing old and new Big Macs is misleading and unreliable.--- Final Verdict:The claim that the Big Mac has shrunk significantly since the 1980s is false. Multiple lines of evidence, including official statements, product weight measurements over time, caloric data, and inflation-adjusted pricing, show that the burger’s size has remained essentially the same. The viral image used as “proof” is misleading, and the price increase aligns with normal inflation rather than an unjustified price hike for a smaller product.;Fact Check: No, McDonald's Big Mac Hasn't Shrunk Since the 80s (But Price Increase is Modest);The claim that McDonald's Big Mac has shrunk significantly in size since the 1980s is false. While social media posts widely circulate an image purporting to show a smaller 2024 Big Mac compared to an 1980s version, evidence refutes this. McDonald's Denmark explicitly denies any change in the Big Mac's size since its introduction to Denmark in 1981, stating that such changes are not allowed. Furthermore, calorie counts for Big Macs in Denmark (from 2001 to 2025) and the US (from 1996 to 2025) show no indication of a decrease in size, in fact, the US Big Mac has more calories now than in 1996. Physical measurements of current Big Macs in Copenhagen are consistent with documented weights from over 20 years ago. Although the price of a Big Mac has increased, this rise is not substantial when adjusted for inflation. Therefore, the evidence strongly suggests that the Big Mac has maintained its size since the 1980s.;Here's the verdict for the fact-check:1. What is the claim being evaluated? The claim being evaluated is that McDonald's Big Mac burger has shrunk significantly in size (with some posts claiming 40% smaller) since the 1980s, while simultaneously increasing significantly in price.2. Based on the evidence provided, is the claim true, false, mixed or another verdict category? False.3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict? McDonald's press department in Denmark explicitly denies that the Big Mac has changed size since McDonald's came to Denmark in 1981, stating, We are not allowed to do that at all. Evidence regarding the weight and calorie content of Big Macs over time also refutes the claim. A Big Mac in Denmark weighed 209 grams and contained 511 calories in 2001, which is consistent with current measurements (TjekDet bought three Big Macs weighing 200g, 206g, and 222g, and the Danish website lists 510 calories). For the US, a 2003 Big Mac weighed 216 grams, which aligns with current measurements, and the calorie count in the US has actually increased from 530 calories in 1996 to 590 calories today. While the price has increased, when adjusted for inflation, the increase is not significant. For example, 45 cents in 1968 (the initial price) is worth just over $4 today, while a Big Mac in the USA costs $5.69.Final Verdict: The claim that McDonald's Big Mac has shrunk significantly in size since the 1980s while simultaneously increasing significantly in price is false. Evidence from McDonald's themselves, historical calorie and weight data, and current measurements all indicate that the Big Mac's size has remained consistent over decades. While the price has increased, it has not done so significantly when accounting for inflation.;Big Mac hasn't shrunk: Claim of significant size reduction since 1980s is FALSE;Verdict: False Evidence: McDonald's press department in Denmark denies that the Big Mac has changed size. Weight measurements of Big Macs purchased in Copenhagen were consistent with archived content descriptions from 2001 (209 grams then vs 200-222 grams now). Calorie counts have remained relatively consistent over the years (511 calories in 2001 vs 510 calories now in Denmark, and 530 calories in 1996 vs 590 calories now in the US). Claim: The claim being fact-checked is that the McDonald's Big Mac has shrunk significantly in size since the 1980s. Here's the combined summary: The claim that the McDonald's Big Mac has shrunk significantly in size since the 1980s is false. The evidence shows that despite claims of a 40% reduction in size, the weight and calorie count of the Big Mac have remained relatively consistent over the years. According to McDonald's press department in Denmark, the size of the Big Mac has not changed since its introduction in Denmark in 1981. Additionally, archived content descriptions from 2001 and weight measurements of Big Macs purchased in Copenhagen support this claim, showing similar weights (209 grams in 2001 vs 200-222 grams now). While prices have increased, this is largely consistent with inflation. Overall, the evidence refutes the claim that the Big Mac has shrunk significantly in size since the 1980s.;Here are the brief answers to each question:What is the claim being evaluated?The claim being evaluated is that the McDonald's Big Mac has shrunk significantly in size since the 1980s, with some posts claiming it has become 40% smaller.Based on the evidence provided, is the claim true, false, mixed or another verdict category?FalseWhat evidence or reasoning supports this verdict?The evidence that supports this verdict includes:McDonald's press department in Denmark's denial that the Big Mac has changed size since 1981.The weight of Big Macs purchased in Copenhagen (200-222 grams) being consistent with archived content descriptions from 2001 (209 grams).The calorie count of Big Macs remaining relatively consistent over the years.These points suggest that the size of the Big Mac has not changed significantly since the 1980s.Final Verdict:The claim that the McDonald's Big Mac has shrunk significantly in size since the 1980s is FALSE. The evidence from McDonald's, weight measurements, and calorie counts all support the conclusion that the size of the Big Mac has remained relatively consistent, contradicting claims of a significant reduction in size.Meta AI response: Here are the brief answers to each question: What is the claim being evaluated?

The evidence from McDonald's, weight measurements, and calorie counts all support the conclusion that the size of the Big Mac has remained relatively consistent, contradicting claims of a significant reduction in size.;Big Mac Hasn't Shrunk Since the 1980s, Despite Viral Claims of 40% Size Drop;The claim circulating on social media, particularly on Facebook, asserts that McDonald's Big Mac has shrunk significantly in size—by as much as 40%—since the 1980s while its price has risen sharply. This fact-check, conducted by TjekDet, finds the claim to be false.Key evidence refuting the size reduction includes McDonald's Denmark's official statement that the Big Mac's size has remained unchanged since the chain's arrival in Denmark in 1981. TjekDet's investigation supports this, with measurements of three Big Macs purchased in Copenhagen in 2024 weighing 200g, 206g, and 222g, closely aligning with a 209g weight recorded in 2001 via the Wayback Machine. In the U.S., historical data shows a Big Mac weighed 216g in 2003, consistent with current weights, and its calorie content has increased from 530 in 1996 to 590 in 2025, suggesting no reduction in size. No evidence, including the widely shared image comparing a 1980s and 2024 Big Mac, substantiates a 40% size decrease.Regarding price, the Big Mac cost 45 cents in 1968 in the U.S., equivalent to about $4 today after inflation adjustment, compared to its current $5.69 price. In Denmark, it costs 39 kroner (roughly $5.50). While the nominal price has increased, the real increase is modest when accounting for inflation, countering claims of a significant price surge.In conclusion, the evidence clearly refutes the claim that the Big Mac has shrunk significantly since the 1980s, as both weight and calorie data show consistency or slight increases over time. The price increase is also less dramatic when adjusted for inflation. Thus, the viral social media posts are false, and consumers today are getting a Big Mac comparable in size to those sold decades ago.; Brief Answers1. What is the claim being evaluated? The claim is that McDonald's Big Mac has shrunk significantly in size (some posts specify by 40%) since the 1980s while its price has increased significantly.2. Based on the evidence provided, is the claim true, false, mixed, or another verdict category? The claim is false.3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict? - McDonald's Denmark confirms the Big Mac's size has not changed since 1981. - TjekDet's 2024 measurements (200g, 206g, 222g) align with a 2001 weight of 209g. - U.S. data shows a 216g weight in 2003 and calorie increase from 530 (1996) to 590 (2025), indicating no size reduction. - No evidence supports a 40% size decrease. - Price rose from 45 cents (1968) to $5.69 (2024) in the U.S., but inflation-adjusted ($4 in 1968 dollars), the increase is modest.  Final VerdictThe claim that McDonald's Big Mac has shrunk significantly in size (by up to 40%) since the 1980s while its price has increased significantly is false. Evidence from McDonald's Denmark, TjekDet's measurements (200g–222g in 2024 vs. 209g in 2001), and U.S. data (216g in 2003, 590 calories in 2025 vs. 530 in 1996) shows no size reduction. The price increase from 45 cents in 1968 to $5.69 in 2024 (U.S.) or 39 kroner in Denmark is moderate when adjusted for inflation (equivalent to ~$4 in 1968 dollars). No documentation, including the viral image, supports the claimed size decrease, confirming the claim is untrue.

McDonald’s Denmark denies any change in the size of the Big Mac since it launched in Denmark in 1981, stating they are not allowed to alter its size. Independent measurements in 2024 found Big Macs from different Danish restaurants weighed between 200 and 222 grams. Archived data from 2001 shows a Big Mac weighed 209 grams, nearly identical to current weights, and contained similar calories (around 510). In the USA, Big Macs in 1996 weighed about 216 grams and contained fewer calories (530) than today’s 590 calories, indicating the burger has not shrunk. Price increases exist, but when adjusted for inflation, the price changes are moderate and consistent with economic factors.Verdict:The claim that the Big Mac has shrunk significantly since the 1980s is false. Evidence from McDonald’s official statements, independent measurements, and archived nutritional data all show the size and weight of the Big Mac have remained essentially the same over the past decades. While prices have increased, this is largely consistent with inflation. Thus, the perception that the burger is smaller today is not supported by the facts.;1. Claim:The claim being assessed is that McDonald’s Big Mac has significantly shrunk in size—by about 40 percent—since the 1980s, while its price has increased substantially.2. Final Verdict:False.3. Explanation:The evidence shows that McDonald’s officially denies any change in the Big Mac’s size since the 1980s. Independent measurements from 2024 align closely with archived data from 2001 and earlier U.S. records, indicating the burger’s weight and calorie content have remained consistent over time. Although the price has increased, this rise is moderate when adjusted for inflation. Therefore, the claim that the Big Mac has shrunk significantly is not supported by the factual data.;Fact Check: Claims of Shrunken Big Macs Since the 80s Are False, Price Hikes Modest When Accounting for Inflation;Claim: The McDonald's Big Mac has significantly shrunk in size since the 1980s while simultaneously increasing significantly in price, with some claims suggesting a 40 percent reduction in size.Evidence: Size: McDonald's Denmark denies any change in Big Mac size since its introduction to Denmark in 1981. Weight and Calories (Denmark): TjekDet's research of current Big Macs in Copenhagen found weights of 200g, 206g, and 222g. An archived content description from 2001 shows a Big Mac weighing 209g and containing 511 calories. Current Danish Big Macs contain 510 calories. While calorie counts have varied slightly (e.g., 503 in 2019, 487 in 2022), they remain consistent with past figures. Weight and Calories (USA): In 1996, an American Big Mac had 530 calories, today it has 590 calories, indicating an increase in calories. In 2003, an American Big Mac weighed 216g, which is consistent with current Danish weights. Price: The Big Mac was introduced in the US in 1968 for 45 cents. Adjusted for inflation, this would be just over $4 today. A Big Mac in the USA currently costs $5.69. In Denmark, the normal price is 39 kroner. While the price has increased nominally, it has not increased significantly when accounting for inflation.Verdict: False. There is no evidence to suggest that the Big Mac has shrunk in size since the 1980s. In fact, calorie content in the US Big Mac has slightly increased since 1996. While the price has increased, this increase is largely in line with inflation.;1. Claim Being Assessed:The claim is that the McDonald's Big Mac has significantly shrunk in size (by as much as 40 percent) since the 1980s, while simultaneously experiencing a significant price increase.2. Final Verdict:False.3. Explanation of how the evidence supports the verdict:The fact-check directly refutes both parts of the claim. Regarding size: McDonald's Denmark explicitly states that the Big Mac's size has not changed since its introduction in 1981. Furthermore, historical data and current measurements support this. In Denmark, a Big Mac weighed 209 grams and contained 511 calories in 2001, which is remarkably consistent with current Big Macs weighing between 200g and 222g and containing 510 calories. For the US, calorie counts show an increase from 530 calories in 1996 to 590 calories currently, and a weight of 216 grams in 2003 is consistent with current findings. There is no documented evidence that the burger has become smaller. Regarding price: While the nominal price of a Big Mac has increased since the 1960s (from 45 cents in 1968 to $5.69 today in the US), when adjusted for inflation, the increase is not significant. 45 cents in 1968 is equivalent to just over $4 today, making the current price of $5.69 a modest increase in real terms. The price in Denmark (39 kroner) is also consistent with international pricing.;Fact-Check: No, Big Mac Hasn't Shrunk Significantly in Size Since the 1980s;Claim: The Big Mac has shrunk significantly in size since the 1980s, with some social media posts claiming it's become 40% smaller. Evidence: A viral image comparing an old and new Big Mac appears to show a significant size difference. McDonald's Denmark denies any size change, stating the burger's size hasn't changed since 1981. Research found consistent weights for Big Macs in Denmark: 209g in 2001 (via archived website data) and 200-222g in 2024 (via weighing samples). Calorie counts have remained relatively stable, with 511 calories in 2001 and 510 calories currently in Denmark. In the US, a Big Mac weighed 216g in 2003 and currently has 590 calories, similar to past counts. Verdict: False. The evidence shows no indication that the Big Mac has shrunk in size since the 1980s. While prices have increased, this is largely consistent with inflation. The consistency in weight and calorie count over the years supports the conclusion that the size of the Big Mac has remained the same.;1. Claim: The Big Mac has shrunk significantly in size since the 1980s.2. Final Verdict: False.3.

Calorie counts have remained relatively stable, with 511 calories in 2001 and 510 calories currently in Denmark. This consistency in weight and calorie count indicates that the size of the Big Mac has not shrunk significantly, contradicting the claim.;No Shrinkage Here: Big Mac Size Unchanged Since 1980s, Despite Social Media Claims;Claim: Social media posts claim that McDonald's Big Mac has shrunk by 40% since the 1980s while significantly increasing in price, with some posts using an image comparing a supposed 1980s Big Mac to a 2024 version.Evidence: - TjekDet's investigation found no evidence that the Big Mac has shrunk since the 1980s. McDonald's Denmark confirmed the size has remained unchanged since 1981.- TjekDet weighed three Big Macs in Copenhagen (2024), finding weights of 200g, 206g, and 222g. A 2001 archived Danish Big Mac weighed 209g, with 511 calories, nearly identical to today's 510 calories.- In the U.S., a 2003 Big Mac weighed 216g, and calorie counts have increased from 530 in 1996 to 590 in 2025, contradicting claims of a smaller burger.- Price has risen (e.g., from 45 cents in 1968 to $5.69 in 2024 in the U.S.), but when adjusted for inflation, the increase is modest (1968's 45 cents equals ~$4 today).- The image used in social media posts lacks verifiable proof of representing a 1980s Big Mac.Verdict: False. The claim that the Big Mac has shrunk by 40% since the 1980s is unsupported by evidence. Historical data, current measurements, and McDonald's statements confirm the burger's size has remained consistent, while price increases align with inflation. The viral image lacks credibility as evidence.;Claim: Social media posts assert that McDonald's Big Mac has decreased in size by 40% since the 1980s while its price has significantly increased, often citing an image comparing a supposed 1980s Big Mac to one from 2024.Verdict: False.Explanation: The evidence refutes the claim of a 40% size reduction. TjekDet's investigation, including weighing Big Macs in 2024 (200g–222g) and comparing to a 2001 Danish Big Mac (209g, 511 calories) and a 2003 U.S. Big Mac (216g), shows consistent sizing. Current calorie counts (510 in Denmark, 590 in the U.S.) are similar or higher than historical data (530 in 1996 U.S.), indicating no shrinkage. McDonald's Denmark confirmed the size has not changed since 1981. The image used in posts lacks authentication. While prices have risen (e.g., 45 cents in 1968 to $5.69 in 2024 in the U.S.), inflation adjustments show modest increases (~$4 in today’s dollars). The lack of evidence for size reduction and the presence of consistent historical data support the false verdict.
FC_11;Bullet point summary;; Several viral posts on social media claim that the McDonald's Big Mac has shrunk by 40 percent since 1980.      A picture of a Big Mac, supposedly from the 1980s, is used as documentation.      But TjekDets research shows that there is no indication that the popular burger has shrunk in recent decades. ;This is the fact to chek: A sure winner among hangover-stricken Danes on January 1st is McDonalds - and many probably swear by one of their signature burgers - the Big Mac. But would you have been fuller if you had sunk your teeth into a Big Mac back in the 1980s? At least that's what several posts on Facebook claim, which are currently being seen by thousands of users. The posts claim that the burger has shrunk significantly in size , while at the same time increasing significantly in price . The claim is widespread in both Danish and English Facebook posts . One of the English posts has 29,000 shares , while another has been shared more than 9,000 times . Some of the posts claim that the burger has become 40 percent smaller . As documentation, many of the posts use the same image, which shows two Big Macs. One is supposedly from the 1980s, while the other is from 2024. If the image is to be believed, then there is a significant size difference. This image is repeated in numerous posts, where it is claimed that McDonald's Big Mac has shrunk significantly since the happy 80s (Photo: Screenshot of Facebook). But while it might take two Big Macs to cure your hangover today, it wouldn't have been any different in the 1980s According to TjekDet's research, there is no indication that the Big Mac has shrunk since the 1980s. However, it has increased in price - although not very much if you take inflation into account. The price increase According to an article from the Pennsylvania Center for the Book, the Big Mac was first introduced in the 1960s by Jim Delligatti, who owned a number of McDonald's restaurants in Pittsburgh, USA. In 1968, the Big Mac was added to the menu at all McDonald's restaurants in the United States. And the price? It was 45 cents. If you use an inflation converter to calculate what 45 cents in 1968 is worth today, the answer is just over $4. Today, a Big Mac in the USA costs $5.69 - equivalent to just over 40 Danish kroner, while the normal price in Denmark is 39 kroner for one of the popular burgers. From country to country, there is virtually no difference in what a Big Mac looks like. That is why the media outlet “The Economist” has published  the “Big Mac Index” since 1986 as a way to compare price levels across borders and currencies. In 2024,  “The Economist” has calculated that Switzerland will have the world's most expensive Big Mac with a price of $8.17 - equivalent to about 58 Danish kroner. But what about the size? The price is one thing, but what happened to the size of the Big Mac? Some of the posts on social media claim that the burger has become 40 percent smaller since 1980. If you ask McDonald's press department in Denmark, they flatly deny that the Big Mac has changed size. “The size of Big Mac's has not changed since McDonald's came to Denmark in 1981. We are not allowed to do that at all,” says Mads Jensen, a communications officer at McDonald's. Today, McDonald's Danish website states that a Big Mac contains 510 calories. If you look at the American version , it contains 590 calories. But on neither the Danish nor the American website can you see how much a Big Mac weighs. Therefore, TjekDet bought three Big Mac's at three different McDonald's restaurants in Copenhagen and here the weight was 200 grams, 206 grams and 222 grams. By using the Wayback Machine, which is an internet archiving tool, TjekDet has managed to find the content description for a Big Mac in Denmark back in 2001 . Back then, a Big Mac weighed 209 grams and contained 2137 kJ, which corresponds to 511 calories. In terms of both weight and calories, the Big Mac is basically the same today as it was more than 20 years ago, so you shouldn't feel cheated when you sink your teeth into a Big Mac in 2025. However, the number of calories has varied a little. In 2019, McDonald's website stated that there were 503 calories in a Big Mac, while in 2022 there were 487 calories - and as previously mentioned - today there are 510 calories in one of the popular burgers.  In 2020, McDonald's in Denmark had a turnover of 2.7 billion kroner, McDonald's writes on its own website. Photo: Shutterstock More calories in Everything is bigger in the USA sounds like a cool phrase, but when it comes to Big Macs, there isn't much difference between Denmark and the USA. For Big Macs in the US, there are significantly more content designations to dig up than in recent decades, and there is nothing to suggest that the Big Mac has shrunk in size. The biggest difference from Denmark is the number of calories, which is generally higher in the US than in Denmark. In 1996 we can see that there were 530 calories in an American Big Mac , so there are actually more calories in the burger in 2025 than back then - namely 590 calories. In 2003, we can see that the burger weighed 216 grams, which is roughly consistent with the results that TjekDet obtained. Even though we can't go back any further than 1996 for the USA and 2001 for Denmark, there is no documentation that the popular burger has become smaller.;Zero-shot;Fact Check: Big Mac Has Not Shrunk Since the 1980s — Size Remains Stable Despite Price Increase;Claim:McDonald's Big Mac has significantly shrunk in size (by about 40%) since the 1980s, while its price has increased considerably.Key Evidence: Multiple Facebook posts claim the Big Mac is much smaller today than in the 1980s, supported by a widely shared image comparing two burgers. McDonald's Denmark denies any change in the size of the Big Mac since 1981, stating size changes are not allowed. Current Big Macs purchased in Denmark weigh around 200–222 grams, consistent with a 2001 archived weight of 209 grams. Calorie content today (around 510 kcal) is similar to 2001 levels (511 kcal), with some minor fluctuations in intermediate years. In the US, data from 1996 and 2003 also show consistent burger weight and calories, with current calories even higher than in 1996. Price comparisons show that, when adjusted for inflation, the price increase from 1968 to 2024 is modest. The “Big Mac Index” demonstrates price variation across countries but not size changes.Verdict:False — There is no evidence that the Big Mac has shrunk significantly since the 1980s. The burger’s size and calorie content have remained largely stable over the decades, though the price has increased modestly when adjusted for inflation.;1. Claim being evaluated:McDonald's Big Mac has become significantly smaller (about 40% smaller) since the 1980s, while its price has increased substantially.2. Verdict:False3. Explanation:The evidence shows that the size and weight of the Big Mac have remained essentially unchanged since at least 2001, with current measurements matching historical data. Calorie counts have also stayed roughly consistent, and McDonald's officially denies any size reduction. Although the price has increased over time, the rise is modest when adjusted for inflation. Therefore, the claim that the Big Mac has shrunk significantly is not supported by the facts.;Big Mac Size Hasn't Shrunk Since the 80s, Price Increase Modest After Inflation;Claim: McDonald's Big Mac has significantly shrunk in size (by up to 40%) since the 1980s, while its price has significantly increased.Key Evidence: Size: McDonald's Denmark denies any change in Big Mac size since its introduction in Denmark in 1981. TjekDet's current measurements of Big Macs in Copenhagen show weights of 200-222 grams. Archived data from 2001 for Denmark shows a Big Mac weighed 209 grams and contained 511 calories. Archived data from 1996 for the US shows an American Big Mac had 530 calories, increasing to 590 calories today. Archived data from 2003 for the US shows a Big Mac weighed 216 grams. Calorie counts in Denmark have varied slightly (503 in 2019, 487 in 2022, 510 today), but generally remain consistent with historical data. There is no documentation from either Denmark (back to 2001) or the USA (back to 1996) to suggest the burger has become smaller. Price: The Big Mac cost 45 cents in the US in 1968. Adjusted for inflation, 45 cents in 1968 is equivalent to just over $4 today. Today, a Big Mac costs $5.69 in the USA and 39 Danish kroner in Denmark (equivalent to about $5.50 USD). While the price has increased in nominal terms, when adjusted for inflation from 1968, the current price is not a significant increase.Verdict: False. There is no indication that the Big Mac has shrunk in size since the 1980s. While the price has increased, it has not done so significantly when accounting for inflation.;1. Claim Being Evaluated: McDonald's Big Mac has significantly shrunk in size (by up to 40%) since the 1980s, while its price has significantly increased.2. Verdict: False.3. Explanation: The fact-check provides evidence from McDonald's themselves, as well as historical and current data on Big Mac weight and calorie content in both Denmark and the USA, all of which indicate that the Big Mac's size has remained largely consistent over decades. While the nominal price has increased, when adjusted for inflation from its 1968 introduction, the price increase is not substantial.;Claim That Big Mac Has Shrunk Significantly in Size Since 1980s Is False;Has the Big Mac Shrunk in Size? Claim Being Evaluated: The claim being evaluated is that McDonald's Big Mac has significantly shrunk in size since the 1980s while increasing in price. Key Evidence Used: Image Comparison: A widely shared image on Facebook comparing a Big Mac from the 1980s to one from 2024, suggesting a significant size difference. McDonald's Statement: McDonald's press department in Denmark denies any change in the size of the Big Mac since its introduction in Denmark in 1981. Weight Comparison: TjekDet's investigation found the weight of a Big Mac to be around 200-222 grams in 2024, compared to 209 grams in 2001 (based on archived content description). Calorie Comparison: The calorie count has remained relatively consistent, with 511 calories in 2001 and 510 calories in 2024 in Denmark. In the US, the calorie count has increased from 530 in 1996 to 590 in 2024. Price Comparison: The price of a Big Mac has increased from 45 cents in 1968 to $5.69 in 2024 in the USA, but when adjusted for inflation, the increase is not significant. Verdict: Based on the evidence provided, the claim that the Big Mac has significantly shrunk in size since the 1980s is False. While there have been some variations in calorie count and weight over the years, there is no indication of a significant reduction in size. The price increase is notable but not significant when adjusted for inflation.;Claim Being Evaluated: The claim that McDonald's Big Mac has significantly shrunk in size since the 1980s while increasing in price.Verdict: FalseExplanation: The claim is deemed false because the evidence presented does not support a significant reduction in size. McDonald's denies any size change, and investigations into the burger's weight and calorie count over the years show consistency, with some minor variations. While the price has increased, adjusting for inflation shows the increase is not as significant as claimed.Meta AI response: Claim Being Evaluated: The claim that McDonald's Big Mac has significantly shrunk in size since the 1980s while increasing in price. Verdict: False Explanation: The claim is deemed false because the evidence presented does not support a significant reduction in size. McDonald's denies any size change, and investigations into the burger's weight and calorie count over the years show consistency, with some minor variations. While the price has increased, adjusting for inflation shows the increase is not as significant as claimed.;No Shrinkage: McDonald's Big Mac Size Unchanged Since 1980s, Debunking 40% Smaller Claim;Claim: Social media posts claim that McDonald's Big Mac has shrunk by 40% since the 1980s while significantly increasing in price, supported by an image comparing a 1980s Big Mac to a 2024 one.Key Evidence:- McDonald's Denmark denies any size change since 1981.- TjekDet's tests in Copenhagen showed Big Macs weighing 200–222 grams, consistent with a 2001 archived record of 209 grams.- Calorie counts in Denmark: 511 calories in 2001, 510 in 2024 (with minor fluctuations). In the US: 530 calories in 1996, 590 in 2024, and 216 grams in 2003, aligning with current weights.- Price increased from 45 cents in 1968 (US) to $5.69 in 2024, but inflation-adjusted, it’s roughly $4, indicating a modest real increase. In Denmark, it’s 39 kroner (~$5.60).- No historical data supports a 40% size reduction, the image lacks verified authenticity.Verdict: False. Evidence shows the Big Mac’s size has remained consistent since at least 1996 (US) and 2001 (Denmark), with no indication of a 40% reduction. Price increases are largely in line with inflation.;1. Claim: Social media posts claim that McDonald's Big Mac has shrunk by 40% since the 1980s while significantly increasing in price, supported by an image comparing a 1980s Big Mac to a 2024 one.2. Verdict: False3. Explanation: Evidence from TjekDet’s investigation, including weight measurements (200–222 grams in 2024 vs. 209 grams in 2001 in Denmark, 216 grams in 2003 in the US) and calorie counts (511 calories in 2001 vs. 510 in 2024 in Denmark, 530 calories in 1996 vs. 590 in 2024 in the US), shows no significant size reduction. McDonald's Denmark confirms no size changes since 1981. The price increase (45 cents in 1968 to $5.69 in 2024 in the US) aligns closely with inflation (equivalent to ~$4 today). The image lacks verified authenticity, and no data supports the 40% size reduction claim.
FC_12;Assertion;Is it true that over half of Ukrainians would give up land for peace?;Assertion The majority of the Ukrainian population now says, according to Gallup, that they want an end to the war. They want peace negotiations, cede territories, rather than continue this war. Conclusion It is true, according to the 2024 poll, that 52 percent of the population wants peace negotiations to end the war as soon as possible. However, it is not true that half the population wants to cede territories. The survey only asked respondents who already wanted peace negotiations whether they were open to ceding territories. Here again, 52 percent answered yes.;This is the fact-check: During NRK's ??Debatten on May 20, the leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), Marielle Leraand, brought up an opinion poll conducted by the American analysis agency Gallup . The agency regularly conducts surveys in Ukraine as part of its World Poll .Leraand claimed that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country.We have reviewed the numbers to find out if her claim is true.It is true that over half (52 percent) of those surveyed said they wanted Ukraine to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible.However, it is not true that the majority have said they want to give up land. The survey only asked the question of whether Ukraine should give up land to those who responded that they wanted peace negotiations. Of these, 52 percent responded that they wanted to give up land in negotiations. 38 percent responded that they did not want this, and nine percent were unsure or refrained from answering.When asked first whether Ukraine should negotiate or continue fighting, 38 percent said the country should continue fighting until it wins the war. This is a decrease from Gallup's previous surveys from 2023 and 2022. In 2022, 73 percent were in favor of continuing to fight, and 63 percent said the same in 2023.Both VG and NRK have investigated several of the allegations that emerged during the Debate.The Gallup poll was conducted in August and October 2024, with the figures published in November of the same year. It is reported that the agency is unable to conduct the surveys in occupied territories due to lack of coverage by Ukrainian telecom operators. This means that approximately 10–12 percent of the population is excluded from the surveys.The agency has regularly conducted surveys in Ukraine. In an article, they explain the challenges involved in conducting surveys in a war zone .Professor at the Department of Political Science at the University of Oslo, Jørgen Bølstad, tells Faktisk.no that even though the surveys were conducted in a country at war, we can read something from them.Bølstad also explains that there is consistency between the surveys from Gallup and other surveys, including those from the Kyiv Institute of Sociology  (KIIS).– Findings from KIIS indicate that around 38 percent are willing to give up land to get a quick peace agreement, while 51 percent are not, says Bølstad.– This also illustrates that the wording of the questions is absolutely crucial. It is not surprising that a people at war can imagine peace. The big question is what kind of peace they want, and at what price. It is unlikely that many people want the West to stop sending aid.He also says that it is important to take into account that the surveys were conducted a few months ago, and that things may have changed in the meantime.– Difficult to explain all the detailsFOR leader Marielle Leraand writes in an email to Faktisk.no that the format of the Debate made it difficult to explain all the details of the survey.– The answer options in the survey were “Ukraine should continue fighting until it wins the war”. 38 percent thought this. The Norwegian public has created the impression that an overwhelming majority of Ukrainians will continue to fight.– But 52 percent thought that: “Ukraine should seek to negotiate an ending to the war as soon as possible”. That is what we in FOR think. We do not have a specific opinion about what the negotiation result should be.;Vanilla;Claim That Most Ukrainians Support Peace Talks and Giving Up Land Is Mixed, Poll Shows;Assertion:During NRK's Debatten on May 20, Marielle Leraand, leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), claimed that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country.Conclusion:The claim is partially misleading. It is true that a majority (52%) of Ukrainians surveyed by Gallup in late 2024 want peace negotiations to begin as soon as possible. However, it is not accurate to say that a majority support giving up territory. Only those who favored negotiations were asked about land concessions, and among them, just 52% supported giving up land—meaning this view represents a smaller segment of the total population. Additionally, 38% of all respondents still supported fighting until Ukraine wins the war. The surveys do not cover Russian-occupied territories, which excludes about 10–12% of the population.;Verdict: MixedReason:Marielle Leraand correctly stated that a majority (52%) of Ukrainians in the Gallup survey supported starting peace negotiations. However, she inaccurately implied that a majority also support giving up territory to achieve peace. In reality, only a subset of respondents—those who favored negotiations—were asked about territorial concessions, and only 52% of that group supported giving up land. Therefore, her overall claim combines a true statement with a misleading interpretation, warranting a Mixed verdict.;Fact-Check: Ukrainian Support for Peace Negotiations Up, but Land Concession Claim is Mixed;Marielle Leraand, leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), asserted during NRK's Debatten on May 20 that a majority of Ukrainians desire peace negotiations, even if it entails ceding parts of the country.The fact-check concludes that while it is true that over half (52%) of Ukrainians surveyed by Gallup in August and October 2024 wanted Ukraine to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible, it is not true that a majority have indicated a willingness to give up land. The question about ceding land was only posed to those who responded that they wanted peace negotiations. Of that subgroup, 52% were willing to give up land, while 38% were not. Furthermore, 38% of all respondents stated that Ukraine should continue fighting until it wins the war. This contrasts with previous Gallup surveys in 2022 (73%) and 2023 (63%) where a larger majority favored continued fighting.;The appropriate verdict for Marielle Leraand's claim is Mixed.Here's why: Partially True: Her claim that over half (52 percent) of those surveyed said they wanted Ukraine to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible is supported by the Gallup poll data. Partially False;Most Ukrainians Want Peace Talks, But Claim About Land Concessions Exaggerated;Marielle Leraand, leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), claimed that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country, based on a Gallup opinion poll. Here's the breakdown ¹:Assertion: A majority of Ukrainians support peace negotiations and are willing to give up land.Conclusion: The fact-check confirms that 52% of Ukrainians surveyed want to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible. However, it doesn't entirely support Leraand's claim about giving up land. Among those who want negotiations, 52% are willing to give up land, while 38% are not, and 9% are unsure. Considering the entire survey pool, the percentage of Ukrainians willing to give up land would be lower than a majority.Additionally, the surveys show ¹:Shift in Opinion: In 2022, 73% of Ukrainians favored continuing to fight until winning the war, decreasing to 63% in 2023 and further down to 38% in the 2024 survey.Consistency with Other Surveys: Professor Jørgen Bølstad notes consistency between Gallup's findings and those from the Kyiv Institute of Sociology, highlighting the importance of question wording and potential changes in public opinion since the survey was conducted in August and October 2024.;Based on the fact-check, the verdict would be Mixed;Ukrainians Favor Peace Talks, But Not Land Concessions: Fact-Checking Marielle Leraand’s Claim;Assertion: During NRK's Debatten on May 20, Marielle Leraand, leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), claimed that a Gallup poll showed a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country.Conclusion: The fact-check confirms that 52% of Ukrainians surveyed by Gallup in August and October 2024 wanted peace negotiations as soon as possible, supporting part of Leraand’s claim. However, her assertion that a majority want to give up land is inaccurate. Only 52% of those who favored negotiations (not the overall sample) supported giving up land, while 38% opposed it, and 9% were unsure. Additionally, 38% of the total respondents wanted to continue fighting until victory, and surveys from 2022 and 2023 showed higher support for fighting (73% and 63%, respectively). The surveys, conducted in a war zone, exclude 10–12% of the population in occupied territories, and other surveys, like those from the Kyiv Institute of Sociology, show 38% willingness to cede land for peace, highlighting the importance of question wording and timing.;Verdict: MixedMarielle Leraand's claim is partially true: the Gallup poll from August and October 2024 shows 52% of Ukrainians surveyed favored peace negotiations as soon as possible. However, her assertion that a majority want to give up land is false, as only 52% of those who supported negotiations (not the overall sample) agreed to cede land, with 38% opposing and 9% unsure.

What is the conclusion and what are the key reasons behind this?Conclusion: The claim is partially incorrect.Key reasons: It is true that 52% of Ukrainians surveyed by Gallup in 2024 said they wanted peace negotiations as soon as possible. However, it is not true that a majority of Ukrainians support giving up land. That specific question was only posed to those already in favor of negotiations, and only 52% of that subgroup supported giving up land. This means around 27% of the total respondents supported both negotiating and giving up land. 38% of respondents wanted Ukraine to continue fighting until it wins the war, a decline from earlier years (73% in 2022, 63% in 2023). The survey excluded populations in occupied territories (10–12% of the population), which may influence the results. Political scientist Jørgen Bølstad emphasizes that wording in surveys is crucial and findings from Gallup align with those of other research institutions like KIIS.In summary, while many Ukrainians support negotiations, it is misleading to suggest that a majority support doing so at the cost of territorial concessions.;1.

However, it is false that a majority of Ukrainians are willing to give up land as part of those negotiations: Only those who favored negotiations were asked about territorial concessions. Of that subgroup, 52% supported giving up land, which equates to about 27% of the total surveyed population. 38% of all respondents wanted to continue fighting, a notable decline from earlier years. The survey did not include people in occupied territories, about 10–12% of Ukraine's population. Expert opinion (Professor Bølstad) supports the reliability of the data but stresses that question wording and survey timing affect interpretation.Conclusion: The claim accurately reflects support for negotiations but misrepresents the level of support for territorial concessions, justifying a Mixed verdict.;Majority of Ukrainians Want Peace Talks, But Not Necessarily Land Concessions;1. What is the claim being verified in this fact-check?The claim being verified is Marielle Leraand's assertion that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country, based on a Gallup poll.2. What is the conclusion and what are the key reasons behind this?The conclusion is that Leraand's claim is partially true, but misleading.Here's why:Partially True (Majority wanting peace negotiations): It is true that over half (52%) of those surveyed by Gallup (in August and October 2024) stated they wanted Ukraine to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible. This marks a decrease in the percentage of Ukrainians who want to continue fighting until victory, which was 73% in 2022 and 63% in 2023, and stood at 38% in the latest poll.Misleading (Majority wanting to give up land): It is not true that a majority of all Ukrainians surveyed expressed a willingness to give up land. The question about giving up land was only posed to the 52% who had already indicated they wanted peace negotiations. Of this specific group, 52% said they were willing to give up land, while 38% were not, and 9% were unsure. Therefore, it's a majority of a subset, not a majority of the entire Ukrainian population surveyed.Contextual Nuances: The fact-check emphasizes that the wording of questions is crucial. While many Ukrainians may desire peace, the price of that peace (i.e., territorial concessions) is a sensitive and complex issue. The survey also couldn't include occupied territories, excluding 10-12% of the population. Furthermore, sentiments might have changed since the poll was conducted in August and October 2024. Consistency with other polls, like those from the Kyiv Institute of Sociology (KIIS), which also show a significant portion unwilling to give up land, supports the nuance that territorial concessions are not universally accepted.;Here's the verdict of the fact-check:1. What is the claim being verified?The claim being verified is Marielle Leraand's assertion that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations even if it means giving up parts of the country.2. What is the final verdict (True;Ukrainians on Peace Negotiations: Majority Want Talks, But Not Necessarily at Any Cost;Claim being verified: The claim being verified is Marielle Leraand's statement that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country.Conclusion and key reasons: The conclusion is that Leraand's claim is partially true. While it's true that over half (52%) of those surveyed want Ukraine to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible, it's not true that a majority of Ukrainians want to give up land. The survey found that among those who wanted peace negotiations, 52% were willing to give up land, but this doesn't represent a majority of all surveyed Ukrainians. Key reasons behind this conclusion include:The survey's conditional questioning, where the question about giving up land was only asked to those who favored peace negotiations.The difference in opinion between those who want to continue fighting (38%) and those who want to negotiate (52%).Professor Jørgen Bølstad's comments on the importance of question wording and the consistency between Gallup's surveys and other surveys, such as those from the Kyiv Institute of Sociology.The surveys were conducted in a war zone, excluding approximately 10-12% of the population in occupied territories, and may not reflect current opinions due to the time elapsed since the survey.;Claim being verified: The claim being verified is that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country, as stated by Marielle Leraand.Final verdict: Mixed;Ukrainians Favor Peace Talks, But Claim of Majority Supporting Land Concessions Is Misleading;1. What is the claim being verified in this fact-check?The fact-check verifies a claim made by Marielle Leraand, leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), during NRK's Debatten on May 20. She claimed that a Gallup poll showed a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country.2. What is the conclusion and what are the key reasons behind this?Conclusion: The claim is partially true. It is accurate that 52% of Ukrainians surveyed by Gallup in August and October 2024 wanted Ukraine to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible. However, it is not true that a majority explicitly wanted to give up land. Only 52% of those who favored negotiations (not the entire sample) supported giving up land, while 38% opposed it, and 9% were unsure.Key Reasons:- The Gallup poll showed 52% of respondents favored immediate peace negotiations, but the question about giving up land was only asked of this group, not the entire sample, meaning the majority of all respondents did not explicitly support ceding territory.- The poll also indicated 38% of respondents wanted Ukraine to continue fighting until victory, a decline from 73% in 2022 and 63% in 2023.- The survey was limited by its inability to include 10–12% of the population in occupied territories due to lack of telecom coverage.- Professor Jørgen Bølstad noted consistency between Gallup’s findings and other surveys, like those from the Kyiv Institute of Sociology, which showed 38% willingness to cede land for peace, but emphasized that question wording and timing affect results.- Leraand acknowledged the debate format limited her ability to explain the survey’s nuances, clarifying that FOR supports negotiations without specifying outcomes.;1. What is the claim being verified?The claim being verified is that made by Marielle Leraand, leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), during NRK's Debatten on May 20. She stated that a Gallup poll showed a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country.2. What is the final verdict (True
FC_12;Assertion;Is it true that over half of Ukrainians would give up land for peace?;Assertion The majority of the Ukrainian population now says, according to Gallup, that they want an end to the war. They want peace negotiations, cede territories, rather than continue this war. Conclusion It is true, according to the 2024 poll, that 52 percent of the population wants peace negotiations to end the war as soon as possible. However, it is not true that half the population wants to cede territories. The survey only asked respondents who already wanted peace negotiations whether they were open to ceding territories. Here again, 52 percent answered yes.;This is the fact-check: During NRK's ??Debatten on May 20, the leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), Marielle Leraand, brought up an opinion poll conducted by the American analysis agency Gallup . The agency regularly conducts surveys in Ukraine as part of its World Poll .Leraand claimed that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country.We have reviewed the numbers to find out if her claim is true.It is true that over half (52 percent) of those surveyed said they wanted Ukraine to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible.However, it is not true that the majority have said they want to give up land. The survey only asked the question of whether Ukraine should give up land to those who responded that they wanted peace negotiations. Of these, 52 percent responded that they wanted to give up land in negotiations. 38 percent responded that they did not want this, and nine percent were unsure or refrained from answering.When asked first whether Ukraine should negotiate or continue fighting, 38 percent said the country should continue fighting until it wins the war. This is a decrease from Gallup's previous surveys from 2023 and 2022. In 2022, 73 percent were in favor of continuing to fight, and 63 percent said the same in 2023.Both VG and NRK have investigated several of the allegations that emerged during the Debate.The Gallup poll was conducted in August and October 2024, with the figures published in November of the same year. It is reported that the agency is unable to conduct the surveys in occupied territories due to lack of coverage by Ukrainian telecom operators. This means that approximately 10–12 percent of the population is excluded from the surveys.The agency has regularly conducted surveys in Ukraine. In an article, they explain the challenges involved in conducting surveys in a war zone .Professor at the Department of Political Science at the University of Oslo, Jørgen Bølstad, tells Faktisk.no that even though the surveys were conducted in a country at war, we can read something from them.Bølstad also explains that there is consistency between the surveys from Gallup and other surveys, including those from the Kyiv Institute of Sociology  (KIIS).– Findings from KIIS indicate that around 38 percent are willing to give up land to get a quick peace agreement, while 51 percent are not, says Bølstad.– This also illustrates that the wording of the questions is absolutely crucial. It is not surprising that a people at war can imagine peace. The big question is what kind of peace they want, and at what price. It is unlikely that many people want the West to stop sending aid.He also says that it is important to take into account that the surveys were conducted a few months ago, and that things may have changed in the meantime.– Difficult to explain all the detailsFOR leader Marielle Leraand writes in an email to Faktisk.no that the format of the Debate made it difficult to explain all the details of the survey.– The answer options in the survey were “Ukraine should continue fighting until it wins the war”. 38 percent thought this. The Norwegian public has created the impression that an overwhelming majority of Ukrainians will continue to fight.– But 52 percent thought that: “Ukraine should seek to negotiate an ending to the war as soon as possible”. That is what we in FOR think. We do not have a specific opinion about what the negotiation result should be.;Chain-of-Thought;Claim That Majority of Ukrainians Support Peace Negotiations and Land Concessions Is Partly True — Support for Negotiations Is Majority, but Not for Giving Up Land;Assertion: A majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up land. Conclusion: The claim is misleading. While a majority do support negotiations, there is no majority support for giving up territory. The statement conflates support for negotiations with support for land concessions, which are distinct positions.;Absolutely! Here’s a concise step-by-step verdict determination for the fact-check:--- 1. Claim Being Evaluated:Marielle Leraand’s claim that:> “A majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country.”--- 2. Key Evidence: 52% of Ukrainians surveyed want to start peace negotiations as soon as possible. The question about giving up land was only posed to those who wanted negotiations. Among that subset, 52% were willing to give up land, but this group represents only part of the total population. When considering the entire surveyed population: Only about 27% (52% of 52%) actually support giving up land. 38% want to continue fighting and a majority do not support land concessions. Other polls (KIIS) show similar results: about 38% willing to give up land, 51% unwilling. Experts stress the importance of question phrasing and clarify that wanting peace doesn’t mean accepting any terms, especially territorial concessions.--- 3. Verdict: Mixed;Ukrainian Peace Talks: Majority Favors Negotiations, But Land Concessions Are a Nuanced Minority View;1. Assertion:Marielle Leraand, leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), claimed during NRK's Debatten on May 20 that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country.2. Main Evidence:The fact-check relies on a Gallup World Poll conducted in Ukraine in August and October 2024, with results published in November 2024.For the claim that a majority want peace negotiations: The survey found that 52% of those surveyed wanted Ukraine to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible.Against the claim that a majority want to give up land: The survey only asked about giving up land to the subset of respondents (52%) who had already stated they wanted peace negotiations. Of this specific group, 52% said they would be willing to give up land. This means only a portion of the overall population supports giving up land.Regarding continuing to fight: 38% of the total respondents said Ukraine should continue fighting until it wins, a decrease from 73% in 2022 and 63% in 2023.Contextualizing the data: The surveys could not be conducted in occupied territories (10-12% of the population excluded). Professor Jørgen Bølstad notes that while the surveys are informative, the wording of questions is crucial. He also points to consistency with other surveys, such as those from the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS), where KIIS findings suggest around 38% are willing to give up land for a quick peace, while 51% are not, further highlighting the nuance and dependence on question wording. He also states that the data is a few months old and sentiment may have changed.3. Conclusion;1. Claim Being Evaluated:Marielle Leraand, leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), claimed that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country.2. Key Evidence Provided:The fact-check primarily uses data from a Gallup World Poll conducted in Ukraine in August and October 2024. Regarding peace negotiations: The poll found that 52% of Ukrainians surveyed wanted their country to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible. This is a significant increase from previous years (27% in 2023, 22% in 2022). Regarding giving up land: The question about giving up land was only asked to the 52% of respondents who stated they desired peace negotiations. Of this subset, 52% responded that they would be willing to give up land in negotiations. The remaining 38% of this subgroup did not want to give up land, and 9% were unsure. Regarding continuing to fight: 38% of the total surveyed population believed Ukraine should continue fighting until it wins the war. This represents a decline from 73% in 2022 and 63% in 2023. Contextual information: The survey excluded approximately 10-12% of the population in occupied territories. Professor Jørgen Bølstad emphasizes that question wording is crucial and that while a desire for peace is understandable, the price of that peace (e.g., territorial concessions) is a separate and complex issue. He also points to consistent findings from other surveys, like those from the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS), which indicate different levels of willingness to cede land depending on the framing of the question.3. Verdict:Mixed;Claim About Ukrainians Wanting Peace at Any Cost Partly True, But Misrepresents Survey Findings on Territorial Compromise;1. Claim Being EvaluatedThe claim being evaluated is that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country, as stated by Marielle Leraand, the leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR).2.

Verdict and ConclusionThe verdict is that while it is true that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, it is not true that a majority are willing to give up land. The survey's findings suggest that Ukrainians are divided on the issue of territorial compromise.Key explanations for the verdict include:The wording of the questions is crucial in understanding the survey's findings.The surveys were conducted in a war zone, and the results should be interpreted with caution.There may have been changes in public opinion since the survey was conducted in August and October 2024.Professor Jørgen Bølstad notes that the surveys provide valuable insights, despite the challenges of conducting research in a war zone, and highlights the importance of considering the nuances of public opinion ¹.;Determining the Verdict1.

Assertion Being EvaluatedThe claim being fact-checked is made by Marielle Leraand, leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), during NRK's Debatten on May 20. She stated that a Gallup poll showed a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country. The core assertion has two parts:- A majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations as soon as possible.- A majority of Ukrainians are willing to give up land to achieve peace.2. Main Evidence ProvidedThe fact-check evaluates Leraand’s claim using data from a Gallup poll conducted in August and October 2024, with results published in November 2024, as part of Gallup’s World Poll in Ukraine. Key evidence includes:- Support for Peace Negotiations: The poll confirms that 52% of respondents wanted Ukraine to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible, supporting the first part of Leraand’s claim.- Giving Up Land: The poll did not ask all respondents whether Ukraine should give up land. Instead, this question was posed only to the 52% who favored peace negotiations. Of those, 52% supported giving up land, 38% opposed it, and 9% were unsure or did not respond. This means only about 27% (52% of 52%) of the total respondents supported giving up land, contradicting the claim that a majority of Ukrainians overall want to cede territory.- Context on Fighting: The poll also found that 38% of respondents believed Ukraine should continue fighting until it wins the war, a decrease from 73% in 2022 and 63% in 2023, indicating a shift in public opinion over time.- Survey Limitations: The Gallup poll could not include 10–12% of Ukraine’s population in occupied territories due to lack of telecom coverage, which may affect representativeness.- Corroborating Data: Jørgen Bølstad, a professor at the University of Oslo, notes consistency between Gallup’s findings and surveys by the Kyiv Institute of Sociology (KIIS), which found 38% of Ukrainians willing to cede land for peace, while 51% were not. Bølstad emphasizes that question wording is critical and that surveys conducted months ago may not reflect current sentiments.- Leraand’s Response: Leraand acknowledged the debate format limited her ability to explain the survey’s details, emphasizing that 52% favored negotiations, aligning with FOR’s stance, but she did not clarify the land concession aspect.3. Conclusion and VerdictThe fact-check concludes that Leraand’s claim is partially true.- True: The first part of her claim—that a majority (52%) of Ukrainians want peace negotiations as soon as possible—is accurate based on the Gallup poll.- False: The second part—that a majority want to give up land—is incorrect. Only 52% of those favoring negotiations (approximately 27% of the total sample) supported ceding land, not a majority of all Ukrainians.- Justification: The Gallup poll data clearly supports the preference for negotiations but refutes the claim about widespread support for territorial concessions. The fact-check highlights the importance of precise question wording and the context of the survey, including its limitations in occupied territories and the time gap since the data was collected. Leraand’s simplification of the survey results in the debate format contributed to the misleading impression about land concessions.; Fact-Check Verdict Determination1. Claim Being Evaluated The claim, made by Marielle Leraand, leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), during NRK's Debatten on May 20, is that a Gallup poll shows a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country. The claim has two components: - A majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations as soon as possible. - A majority of Ukrainians are willing to give up land to achieve peace.2. Key Evidence Provided The fact-check relies on data from a Gallup poll conducted in August and October 2024, published in November 2024, as part of Gallup’s World Poll in Ukraine, along with additional context: - Peace Negotiations: The poll confirms that 52% of respondents supported Ukraine entering peace negotiations as soon as possible. - Land Concessions: The question about giving up land was asked only of the 52% who favored negotiations. Of those, 52% agreed to cede land, 38% opposed it, and 9% were unsure or did not respond. This translates to roughly 27% (52% of 52%) of the total respondents supporting land concessions, not a majority. - Additional Poll Data: 38% of respondents favored continuing to fight until victory, down from 73% in 2022 and 63% in 2023, showing a decline in support for prolonged conflict. - Survey Limitations: The poll excluded 10–12% of Ukraine’s population in occupied territories due to lack of telecom coverage, potentially skewing results. - Corroborating Evidence: Professor Jørgen Bølstad cites a Kyiv Institute of Sociology (KIIS) survey, which found 38% of Ukrainians willing to cede land for peace and 51% opposed, reinforcing that a majority do not support territorial concessions. Bølstad notes that question wording significantly affects responses and that older survey data may not reflect current opinions. - Leraand’s Clarification: Leraand stated the debate format limited her ability to detail the survey, emphasizing the 52% support for negotiations but not addressing the land concession misstep.3. Verdict and Justification Verdict: Mixed - True Component: The claim that a majority of Ukrainians (52%) want peace negotiations as soon as possible is supported by the Gallup poll data, confirming this part of Leraand’s statement. - False Component: The claim that a majority want to give up land is incorrect. Only about 27% of the total respondents (52% of the 52% who favored negotiations) supported ceding territory, far from a majority. The KIIS survey further supports this, showing 51% opposed to land concessions. - Justification: The evidence clearly validates the first part of the claim regarding support for negotiations but refutes the second part about widespread willingness to give up land. Leraand’s statement oversimplifies the survey by implying that the majority support for negotiations extends to territorial concessions, which the data does not support. The survey’s limitations (e.g., exclusion of occupied territories) and the influence of question wording, as noted by Bølstad, further contextualize the findings but do not change the conclusion that the land concession claim is inaccurate. The mixed verdict reflects the partial accuracy of the overall statement.

The claim:Marielle Leraand, leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), claimed that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations even if it means giving up parts of the country.2. The evidence:Gallup surveys from August and October 2024 show 52% of Ukrainians want peace negotiations as soon as possible.However, only those who supported negotiations were asked about giving up land, among them, 52% were willing to give up land, 38% were not, and 9% were unsure.Overall, when asked first whether Ukraine should negotiate or keep fighting, 38% said continue fighting until victory. This is a decline from 73% in 2022 and 63% in 2023.Surveys exclude 10–12% of the population in occupied territories due to lack of telecom coverage.Other sources (Kyiv Institute of Sociology) show similar results: about 38% willing to give up land, 51% opposed.Experts note the importance of question wording and that opinions might have shifted since the survey.3. The verdict:The claim is partially true. It is accurate that a majority want peace negotiations, but it is incorrect to say a majority want to give up land. Only a subset of those favoring negotiations support land concessions, and overall the population is divided on this issue. The fact-check highlights nuances and cautions against oversimplifying the public opinion in Ukraine.;1. Claim being assessed:Marielle Leraand claimed that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations even if it means giving up parts of the country.2. Verdict:Mixed (partially true and partially false).3. Reasoning;Claim that Majority of Ukrainians Want Peace Even if Ceding Land: Mixed Verdict;1. The Claim: Marielle Leraand, leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), claimed that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations even if it means giving up parts of the country.2. The Evidence:A Gallup poll conducted in August and October 2024 (published November 2024) found that 52 percent of Ukrainians surveyed want Ukraine to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible.However, the question about giving up land was only posed to those who already expressed a desire for peace negotiations. Of this subset, 52 percent responded that they were willing to give up land, while 38 percent were not, and 9 percent were unsure.Separately, when asked whether Ukraine should negotiate or continue fighting, 38 percent said the country should continue fighting until it wins the war. This is a decrease from previous Gallup surveys (73% in 2022, 63% in 2023).Professor Jørgen Bølstad notes consistency with other surveys, including from the Kyiv Institute of Sociology (KIIS), which indicates around 38 percent are willing to give up land for a quick peace agreement, while 51 percent are not.The Gallup poll excludes occupied territories (10-12% of the population).3. The Verdict: The claim is mixed.It is true that a majority (52%) of Ukrainians surveyed want peace negotiations as soon as possible.However, it is not true that a majority of all Ukrainians want to give up land. The 52% willing to give up land only represents a majority of those who already wanted peace negotiations, not the general population. When considering all respondents, including those who want to continue fighting, the proportion willing to cede land is significantly smaller.;Here's the final verdict based on the fact-check:1. The claim being assessed: Marielle Leraand claimed that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country.2. The verdict: Mixed3. Reasoning or evidence supporting this decision: True in part: The Gallup poll shows that 52 percent of Ukrainians surveyed want Ukraine to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible. This supports the first part of Leraand's claim that a majority wants peace negotiations. False in part: The key nuance missed by Leraand's statement is that the question about giving up land was only asked to the 52% who already wanted peace negotiations. Of that specific group, 52 percent (which is roughly 27% of the total surveyed population) were willing to give up land. Therefore, a majority of all Ukrainians surveyed did not state a willingness to give up land for peace. This is further corroborated by other surveys, such as KIIS, which show a different distribution of willingness to cede land among the overall population. The fact-check emphasizes that the wording of questions is crucial, and Leraand's generalization misrepresents the broader sentiment.;Claim About Ukrainians Wanting Peace at Any Cost: Mixed Verdict;The ClaimMarielle Leraand, leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), claimed that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country.The EvidenceThe main evidence comes from a Gallup survey conducted in Ukraine in August and October 2024. Key findings include ¹:52% of respondents want Ukraine to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible.Among those who want negotiations, 52% are willing to give up land, 38% are not, and 9% are unsure.38% of respondents believe Ukraine should continue fighting until it wins the war, down from 73% in 2022 and 63% in 2023.The Kyiv Institute of Sociology (KIIS) survey found 38% willing to give up land for a quick peace agreement, while 51% are not.The VerdictThe claim is partially true and partially false. It's true that over half of Ukrainians surveyed want peace negotiations, but it's not true that a majority want to give up land. The surveys suggest Ukrainians are divided on the issue, with a significant portion wanting to continue fighting. The wording of the questions and the context of the war are crucial in understanding the results.Professor Jørgen Bølstad notes that the surveys were conducted in a war zone, but there's consistency between Gallup and KIIS surveys, lending credibility to the findings. However, the surveys were conducted a few months ago, and opinions may have shifted since then.;Final Verdict1. The ClaimThe claim being assessed is that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country, as stated by Marielle Leraand, leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR).2. The VerdictThe verdict is Mixed;Ukrainians Favor Peace Talks, But Claim of Majority Supporting Land Concessions Is Partly True;The Claim: During NRK's Debatten on May 20, Marielle Leraand, leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), claimed that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country.The Evidence: The fact-check references a Gallup poll conducted in August and October 2024, published in November 2024, as part of Gallup's World Poll in Ukraine. The poll found that 52% of respondents supported Ukraine entering peace negotiations as soon as possible. However, only those favoring negotiations were asked about ceding land, with 52% of that group (not the entire sample) agreeing to give up land, 38% opposing, and 9% unsure. Additionally, 38% of all respondents favored continuing the fight until victory, a decline from 73% in 2022 and 63% in 2023. The Kyiv Institute of Sociology (KIIS) reported similar findings, with 38% willing to cede land for peace and 51% opposed. Challenges in conducting surveys in occupied territories (10–12% of the population excluded) and the importance of question wording were noted by Professor Jørgen Bølstad. Leraand acknowledged the survey's complexity and the debate format's limitations.The Verdict: The claim is partially true. It is accurate that 52% of Ukrainians surveyed by Gallup supported peace negotiations. However, the claim that a majority want to give up land is misleading, as only 52% of those favoring negotiations (a subset of respondents) supported ceding land, not the majority of all Ukrainians. The evidence shows nuanced public opinion, with significant support for both negotiations and continuing the fight, and question wording heavily influences results.;1. Claim Being Assessed: Marielle Leraand, leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), claimed during NRK's Debatten on May 20 that a Gallup poll showed a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country.2. Verdict: Partly true.3. Reasoning and Evidence: The Gallup poll from August and October 2024, published in November 2024, confirms that 52% of respondents supported Ukraine entering peace negotiations as soon as possible, aligning with part of Leraand’s claim. However, the claim that a majority want to give up land is misleading. Only those favoring negotiations (52% of the total sample) were asked about ceding land, and of that group, 52% supported it, 38% opposed, and 9% were unsure. This means the overall percentage of Ukrainians willing to cede land is lower than a majority of the total population. Additionally, 38% of all respondents favored continuing to fight until victory, a decline from 73% in 2022 and 63% in 2023. Supporting evidence from the Kyiv Institute of Sociology (KIIS) shows 38% willing to cede land for peace and 51% opposed, reinforcing the nuanced public opinion. The claim oversimplifies the survey by implying a broader consensus on ceding land than the data supports.
FC_12;Assertion;Is it true that over half of Ukrainians would give up land for peace?;Assertion The majority of the Ukrainian population now says, according to Gallup, that they want an end to the war. They want peace negotiations, cede territories, rather than continue this war. Conclusion It is true, according to the 2024 poll, that 52 percent of the population wants peace negotiations to end the war as soon as possible. However, it is not true that half the population wants to cede territories. The survey only asked respondents who already wanted peace negotiations whether they were open to ceding territories. Here again, 52 percent answered yes.;This is the fact-check: During NRK's ??Debatten on May 20, the leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), Marielle Leraand, brought up an opinion poll conducted by the American analysis agency Gallup . The agency regularly conducts surveys in Ukraine as part of its World Poll .Leraand claimed that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country.We have reviewed the numbers to find out if her claim is true.It is true that over half (52 percent) of those surveyed said they wanted Ukraine to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible.However, it is not true that the majority have said they want to give up land. The survey only asked the question of whether Ukraine should give up land to those who responded that they wanted peace negotiations. Of these, 52 percent responded that they wanted to give up land in negotiations. 38 percent responded that they did not want this, and nine percent were unsure or refrained from answering.When asked first whether Ukraine should negotiate or continue fighting, 38 percent said the country should continue fighting until it wins the war. This is a decrease from Gallup's previous surveys from 2023 and 2022. In 2022, 73 percent were in favor of continuing to fight, and 63 percent said the same in 2023.Both VG and NRK have investigated several of the allegations that emerged during the Debate.The Gallup poll was conducted in August and October 2024, with the figures published in November of the same year. It is reported that the agency is unable to conduct the surveys in occupied territories due to lack of coverage by Ukrainian telecom operators. This means that approximately 10–12 percent of the population is excluded from the surveys.The agency has regularly conducted surveys in Ukraine. In an article, they explain the challenges involved in conducting surveys in a war zone .Professor at the Department of Political Science at the University of Oslo, Jørgen Bølstad, tells Faktisk.no that even though the surveys were conducted in a country at war, we can read something from them.Bølstad also explains that there is consistency between the surveys from Gallup and other surveys, including those from the Kyiv Institute of Sociology  (KIIS).– Findings from KIIS indicate that around 38 percent are willing to give up land to get a quick peace agreement, while 51 percent are not, says Bølstad.– This also illustrates that the wording of the questions is absolutely crucial. It is not surprising that a people at war can imagine peace. The big question is what kind of peace they want, and at what price. It is unlikely that many people want the West to stop sending aid.He also says that it is important to take into account that the surveys were conducted a few months ago, and that things may have changed in the meantime.– Difficult to explain all the detailsFOR leader Marielle Leraand writes in an email to Faktisk.no that the format of the Debate made it difficult to explain all the details of the survey.– The answer options in the survey were “Ukraine should continue fighting until it wins the war”. 38 percent thought this. The Norwegian public has created the impression that an overwhelming majority of Ukrainians will continue to fight.– But 52 percent thought that: “Ukraine should seek to negotiate an ending to the war as soon as possible”. That is what we in FOR think. We do not have a specific opinion about what the negotiation result should be.;Least-to-most ;Majority of Ukrainians Favor Peace Talks, But Not All Support Territorial Concessions — Fact-Check Finds Mixed Reality;The claim made by Marielle Leraand is that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations even if it involves conceding territory. Fact-checking confirms that while a majority (52%) do favor entering peace negotiations soon, it is inaccurate to say a majority supports giving up land outright. Only those favoring negotiations were asked about land concessions, and just over half of that subgroup agreed to giving up territory. Meanwhile, 38% of all respondents prefer continuing the fight until victory, though this figure has decreased from previous years. Surveys exclude occupied regions, and other independent polls confirm a similar split on willingness to concede land. Experts emphasize that question wording greatly impacts responses and that Ukrainians’ desire for peace does not necessarily mean acceptance of any terms. Thus, the claim is partially true but oversimplified and missing key context that shapes a more nuanced understanding of Ukrainian public opinion.;Certainly! Here’s the breakdown followed by the final verdict:---1. What is the claim being evaluated?The claim is that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations even if it means giving up parts of the country.2. Based on the evidence provided, is the claim true, false, mixed or another verdict category?The verdict is mixed (partially true but misleading).3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict? It is true that a majority (52%) want peace negotiations soon. However, only a subset of those wanting negotiations were asked about giving up land, and just over half of that group support it, meaning overall support for conceding land is not a majority. A significant portion (38%) still prefers continuing the fight. The claim overlooks important nuances and the specific survey question phrasing, which affects interpretation. Other polls confirm a divided opinion on giving up land, and surveys exclude occupied regions. The claim oversimplifies complex public attitudes toward peace and concessions.---Final verdict:The claim that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations is true. However, the assertion that a majority want to give up parts of the country as part of these negotiations is misleading. While some Ukrainians who favor negotiations also support territorial concessions, this does not constitute a majority of the entire population. Therefore, the claim is mixed—partly accurate but lacking crucial context and nuance, which changes the overall interpretation.;Ukrainians Divided on Peace vs. Land Concessions: Majority Seek Talks, But Not All Favor Giving Up Territory;1. Assertion: Marielle Leraand claimed that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country.2. Conclusion: The fact-check confirms that 52% of Ukrainians surveyed by Gallup in August-October 2024 wanted peace negotiations as soon as possible. However, it refutes the claim that a majority of all Ukrainians want to give up land. The question about giving up land was only asked to the 52% who desired peace negotiations, and of that group, 52% (or about 27% of the total surveyed) were willing to cede land. Conversely, 38% of the total surveyed believed Ukraine should continue fighting until it wins, and other surveys (like KIIS) suggest around 51% are not willing to give up land for a quick peace.;1. What is the claim being evaluated? The claim being evaluated is that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country.2. Based on the evidence provided, is the claim true, false, mixed or another verdict category? Mixed.3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict? The claim is mixed because one part of it is true, while the other is false based on the evidence. It is true that over half (52 percent) of those surveyed by Gallup said they wanted Ukraine to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible. However, it is not true that the majority have said they want to give up land. The survey only asked the question of whether Ukraine should give up land to those who responded that they wanted peace negotiations (52% of that sub-group agreed, which is approximately 27% of the total surveyed). Additionally, 38% of the total respondents said the country should continue fighting, and other surveys (like KIIS) indicate that a majority are not willing to give up land for peace.Final Verdict: Mixed. While it is true that a majority of Ukrainians surveyed (52%) want peace negotiations as soon as possible, the claim that a majority are willing to give up land for peace is false. The willingness to cede territory was only expressed by a subset of those who desired peace negotiations, not a majority of the overall population surveyed.;Ukrainians Back Peace Talks, But Not Clear on Land Concessions;Marielle Leraand claimed that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country. According to the Gallup poll, while 52% of surveyed Ukrainians do want peace negotiations, the claim that a majority wants to give up land is not supported. Only 52% of those who favored negotiations were willing to give up land, which doesn't represent a majority of all surveyed Ukrainians. Other surveys, like KIIS, show similar results, with around 38% willing to give up land for peace. The evidence suggests that while many Ukrainians do want peace negotiations, the specifics of what they're willing to compromise on are more nuanced ¹.;Verdict for the Fact-Check1.

What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict?The evidence shows that 52% of surveyed Ukrainians want Ukraine to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible, which supports the part of the claim about wanting peace negotiations. However, the claim that a majority of Ukrainians want to give up land in these negotiations is not supported. Only 52% of those who favored negotiations (not the majority of all surveyed) were willing to give up land.Final VerdictThe claim that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations is supported, but the claim that a majority want to give up land for these negotiations is not. The evidence suggests a mixed verdict, where part of the claim is true (majority wanting peace negotiations) and part is false (majority wanting to give up land). This nuance is crucial for understanding public opinion in Ukraine regarding the war and potential peace negotiations.Meta AI response: Verdict for the Fact-Check 1.

This nuance is crucial for understanding public opinion in Ukraine regarding the war and potential peace negotiations.;Ukrainians Favor Peace Talks, But No Majority Backs Ceding Land, Fact-Check Finds;1. Assertion: What is the claim about? Marielle Leraand, leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), claimed during NRK's Debatten on May 20 that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country, based on a Gallup poll.2. Conclusion: What are the key pieces of evidence mentioned in the fact-check that support or refute the claim? The Gallup poll from August and October 2024, published in November, confirms that 52% of Ukrainians surveyed favored peace negotiations as soon as possible, supporting part of Leraand’s claim. However, the claim that a majority want to give up land is inaccurate: only 52% of those who supported negotiations (not the entire sample) were willing to cede land, with 38% against and 9% unsure. Additionally, 38% of all respondents preferred continuing the fight until victory, a decline from 73% in 2022 and 63% in 2023. Surveys from the Kyiv Institute of Sociology (KIIS) show 38% willingness to cede land for peace, with 51% opposed, highlighting that question wording affects results. The surveys exclude 10–12% of the population in occupied territories, and Professor Jørgen Bølstad notes that while the surveys are reliable, public opinion may have shifted since they were conducted.Cohesive Summary: During NRK's Debatten on May 20, Marielle Leraand, leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), claimed that a majority of Ukrainians support peace negotiations, even at the cost of ceding territory, citing a Gallup poll. The fact-check confirms that the Gallup poll, conducted in August and October 2024 and published in November, shows 52% of Ukrainians favor immediate peace negotiations, supporting part of Leraand’s claim. However, her assertion that a majority want to give up land is misleading: only 52% of those favoring negotiations (not the overall sample) supported ceding land, with 38% opposed and 9% unsure. Additionally, 38% of all respondents preferred fighting until victory, a notable decline from 73% in 2022 and 63% in 2023. Complementary data from the Kyiv Institute of Sociology indicates 38% willingness to cede land for peace, with 51% against, underscoring the impact of question phrasing. The surveys’ exclusion of 10–12% of the population in occupied areas and the potential for shifting opinions, as noted by Professor Jørgen Bølstad, further contextualize the findings. Thus, while Leraand’s claim about support for negotiations is accurate, her statement about ceding land overstates the evidence, as it applies only to a subset of respondents.;1. What is the claim being evaluated?

Based on the evidence provided, is the claim true, false, mixed, or another verdict category? The claim is mixed.3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict? The Gallup poll from August and October 2024, published in November, confirms that 52% of Ukrainians surveyed favored peace negotiations as soon as possible, supporting the first part of Leraand’s claim. However, the claim that a majority want to give up land is inaccurate: only 52% of those who supported negotiations (not the entire sample) were willing to cede land, with 38% opposed and 9% unsure. Additionally, 38% of all respondents preferred continuing the fight until victory. Surveys from the Kyiv Institute of Sociology (KIIS) show 38% willingness to cede land for peace, with 51% opposed, further indicating that the majority do not support ceding territory. The evidence supports the desire for negotiations but refutes the claim that a majority favor giving up land.Final Verdict: The claim by Marielle Leraand that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country, is mixed. The Gallup poll from August and October 2024 confirms that 52% of Ukrainians support immediate peace negotiations, validating the first part of her claim. However, the assertion that a majority are willing to cede land is false, as only 52% of those favoring negotiations (not the overall sample) supported this, with 38% opposed and 9% unsure. Data from the Kyiv Institute of Sociology further shows that only 38% are willing to give up land, with 51% against. Therefore, while the claim about support for negotiations is true, the claim about ceding territory is not supported by the evidence, resulting in a mixed verdict.

Claim being assessed:A majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country.2. Final verdict:Mixed — partly true, partly false.3. Explanation:The evidence shows that a majority (52%) of Ukrainians do want to begin peace negotiations soon, confirming that part of the claim. However, the claim that a majority support giving up land is not true. Among those wanting negotiations, opinions are split, with only about half willing to concede territory. Overall, a significant portion (38%) prefer continuing the fight without territorial concessions. This nuanced view means the claim is only partially accurate.;Ukrainians Divided on Peace: Majority Desire Negotiations, But Not All Support Ceding Land;Claim: Marielle Leraand, leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), claimed that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country.Verdict: This claim is partially true but misleading.Evidence:It is true that over half (52%) of Ukrainians surveyed by Gallup in August-October 2024 said they wanted Ukraine to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible.However, it is not true that a majority of all Ukrainians said they want to give up land. The question about giving up land was only asked to the 52% who wanted peace negotiations. Of that subgroup, 52% (meaning 27% of all respondents, or approximately half of the respondents who desired peace negotiations) were willing to give up land, while 38% of that subgroup were not.Conversely, 38% of all respondents said Ukraine should continue fighting until it wins the war. This shows a decrease from previous Gallup surveys in 2022 (73%) and 2023 (63%) regarding the desire to continue fighting.Findings from the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) also indicate that around 38% are willing to give up land for a quick peace agreement, while 51% are not, highlighting the importance of question wording.Gallup's surveys do not include occupied territories, excluding 10-12% of the population.Experts note that while the surveys provide valuable insights, the situation is dynamic and views may have changed since the August-October 2024 polling period.Conclusion: While a majority of Ukrainians desire peace negotiations, it is incorrect to state that a majority of all Ukrainians are willing to give up land. The willingness to cede territory is specifically among a subgroup of those who favor negotiations, and a significant portion of Ukrainians still wish to continue fighting until victory.;Here's the verdict based on the fact-check:1.

However, the claim that a majority want to give up land is inaccurate. Only those favoring negotiations (52% of the total) were asked about ceding land, and of them, 52% supported it, equating to roughly 27% of the overall sample, not a majority. Additionally, 38% of respondents preferred continuing to fight until victory, a decline from 73% in 2022 and 63% in 2023. Other surveys, like those from the Kyiv Institute of Sociology, show 38% willingness to cede land, aligning with Gallup’s findings. The surveys exclude 10–12% of Ukraine’s population in occupied territories, and question wording significantly affects responses. Leraand noted the debate format limited her ability to clarify details.Conclusion: Leraand’s claim is partly true. The Gallup poll supports that a majority favor peace negotiations, but it does not show a majority willing to give up land, as her statement implied.;1. Claim Being Assessed: Marielle Leraand, leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), claimed during NRK's Debatten on May quenched 20 that a Gallup poll showed a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country.2. Final Verdict: Mixed3. Explanation: The Gallup poll from August and October 2024 confirms that 52% of respondents supported Ukraine entering peace negotiations as soon as possible, validating the first part of Leraand’s claim. However, the claim that a majority want to give up land is inaccurate. Only those favoring negotiations (52% of the total) were asked about ceding land, and 52% of them agreed, representing about 27% of all respondents, not a majority. Additionally, 38% of respondents favored continuing to fight until victory. Other surveys, like those from the Kyiv Institute of Sociology, show similar results, with 38% open to ceding land. The evidence supports the negotiation preference but refutes the majority land-cession claim, resulting in a mixed verdict.
FC_12;Assertion;Is it true that over half of Ukrainians would give up land for peace?;Assertion The majority of the Ukrainian population now says, according to Gallup, that they want an end to the war. They want peace negotiations, cede territories, rather than continue this war. Conclusion It is true, according to the 2024 poll, that 52 percent of the population wants peace negotiations to end the war as soon as possible. However, it is not true that half the population wants to cede territories. The survey only asked respondents who already wanted peace negotiations whether they were open to ceding territories. Here again, 52 percent answered yes.;This is the fact-check: During NRK's ??Debatten on May 20, the leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), Marielle Leraand, brought up an opinion poll conducted by the American analysis agency Gallup . The agency regularly conducts surveys in Ukraine as part of its World Poll .Leraand claimed that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country.We have reviewed the numbers to find out if her claim is true.It is true that over half (52 percent) of those surveyed said they wanted Ukraine to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible.However, it is not true that the majority have said they want to give up land. The survey only asked the question of whether Ukraine should give up land to those who responded that they wanted peace negotiations. Of these, 52 percent responded that they wanted to give up land in negotiations. 38 percent responded that they did not want this, and nine percent were unsure or refrained from answering.When asked first whether Ukraine should negotiate or continue fighting, 38 percent said the country should continue fighting until it wins the war. This is a decrease from Gallup's previous surveys from 2023 and 2022. In 2022, 73 percent were in favor of continuing to fight, and 63 percent said the same in 2023.Both VG and NRK have investigated several of the allegations that emerged during the Debate.The Gallup poll was conducted in August and October 2024, with the figures published in November of the same year. It is reported that the agency is unable to conduct the surveys in occupied territories due to lack of coverage by Ukrainian telecom operators. This means that approximately 10–12 percent of the population is excluded from the surveys.The agency has regularly conducted surveys in Ukraine. In an article, they explain the challenges involved in conducting surveys in a war zone .Professor at the Department of Political Science at the University of Oslo, Jørgen Bølstad, tells Faktisk.no that even though the surveys were conducted in a country at war, we can read something from them.Bølstad also explains that there is consistency between the surveys from Gallup and other surveys, including those from the Kyiv Institute of Sociology  (KIIS).– Findings from KIIS indicate that around 38 percent are willing to give up land to get a quick peace agreement, while 51 percent are not, says Bølstad.– This also illustrates that the wording of the questions is absolutely crucial. It is not surprising that a people at war can imagine peace. The big question is what kind of peace they want, and at what price. It is unlikely that many people want the West to stop sending aid.He also says that it is important to take into account that the surveys were conducted a few months ago, and that things may have changed in the meantime.– Difficult to explain all the detailsFOR leader Marielle Leraand writes in an email to Faktisk.no that the format of the Debate made it difficult to explain all the details of the survey.– The answer options in the survey were “Ukraine should continue fighting until it wins the war”. 38 percent thought this. The Norwegian public has created the impression that an overwhelming majority of Ukrainians will continue to fight.– But 52 percent thought that: “Ukraine should seek to negotiate an ending to the war as soon as possible”. That is what we in FOR think. We do not have a specific opinion about what the negotiation result should be.;Zero-shot;Majority of Ukrainians Favor Peace Talks, but Not Majority Ready to Cede Territory — Fact-Check Reveals Nuanced Views;Claim being evaluated:Marielle Leraand, leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), claimed that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations even if it means giving up parts of Ukraine.---Key evidence and verdict:Gallup’s 2024 poll showed 52% of Ukrainians want peace negotiations as soon as possible.Among those who wanted negotiations, 52% were willing to give up land, but overall this does not represent a majority of all Ukrainians—only those favoring negotiations were asked about giving up land.38% of all respondents preferred continuing the fight until victory. This is a decrease from earlier polls in 2022 and 2023.Other surveys, like from the Kyiv Institute of Sociology, support similar findings about the split opinions on giving up land.The survey excludes occupied territories (about 10–12% of the population), which may affect results.Experts stress the importance of question wording and timing, public opinion may have shifted since the poll.Leraand acknowledged the difficulty in fully explaining these nuances during the debate.Conclusion:The claim that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations is true. However, it is false to say a majority want to give up land, as only a portion of those favoring negotiations support that. Public opinion is divided and complex.;Certainly! Here’s the verdict structured as requested:---1. Claim being evaluated:A majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country.2. Verdict:Mixed – partly true, partly false.3. Explanation:It is true that a majority (52%) of Ukrainians support peace negotiations. However, it is false that a majority want to give up land, only among those favoring negotiations did about half support giving up territory. Overall, a significant portion (38%) wants to continue fighting until victory. The evidence shows nuanced public opinion rather than a simple majority wanting peace at any cost.;Ukrainians Divided on Land for Peace: Majority Seek Negotiations, But Not Majority Willing to Cede Territory;Here's a summary of the fact-check:Claim Being Evaluated: Marielle Leraand, leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), claimed that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country.Key Evidence and Verdict:Evidence for peace negotiations: It is true that 52% of Ukrainians surveyed by Gallup in August-October 2024 wanted Ukraine to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible.Evidence against giving up land by a majority: It is not true that a majority of all Ukrainians surveyed want to give up land. The question about giving up land was only asked to the 52% who wanted peace negotiations. Of that group, 52% (which calculates to approximately 27% of the total surveyed population) were willing to give up land, while 38% of that subgroup were not.Evidence on continuing to fight: 38% of all respondents said the country should continue fighting until it wins the war, a decrease from previous Gallup surveys.Contextual information: The survey did not include occupied territories. Experts note consistency with other surveys (like KIIS) and emphasize the importance of question wording and the dynamic nature of opinions in a war zone.Verdict: Leraand's claim that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations is true, but her claim that a majority are willing to give up land is false. Only a subset of those who want peace negotiations are willing to cede territory, and this constitutes a minority of the overall Ukrainian population surveyed.;Here's the verdict for the fact-check:1. What is the claim being evaluated?Marielle Leraand, leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), claimed that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country.2. Is the claim true, false, or mixed or other relevant category of verdict?Mixed.3. Provide a brief explanation for your decision based on the evidence presented in the fact-check.The claim is mixed because one part of it is true while the other is false. It is true that a majority (52%) of surveyed Ukrainians want peace negotiations as soon as possible. However, it is false that a majority want to give up land, this question was only posed to those who desired negotiations, and within that group, only 52% (which is not a majority of the overall population surveyed) were willing to cede territory.;Mixed Verdict: Ukrainians Support Peace Talks, But Not Necessarily at the Cost of Land;Claim Being Evaluated:Marielle Leraand, leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), claimed that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country.Key Evidence and Verdict:Survey Results: A Gallup poll conducted in August and October 2024 found that:52% of respondents want Ukraine to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible.Among those who want negotiations, 52% are willing to give up land, while 38% are not, and 9% are unsure.Additional Findings:38% of respondents believe Ukraine should continue fighting until it wins the war, down from 73% in 2022 and 63% in 2023.Surveys exclude approximately 10-12% of the population in occupied territories due to lack of telecom coverage.Expert Opinion: Professor Jørgen Bølstad notes that the surveys show consistency with other polls, like the Kyiv Institute of Sociology, which found 38% willing to give up land for a quick peace agreement, while 51% are not.Verdict: While it's true that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, it's not true that a majority are willing to give up land. The wording of questions is crucial, and opinions may have shifted since the survey was conducted.Conclusion:The fact-check confirms that most Ukrainians support peace negotiations, but the evidence doesn't support the claim that they're willing to give up land as part of those negotiations. The survey results highlight the complexity of Ukrainian public opinion on the matter, with varying perspectives on how to achieve peace ¹.;Verdict for the Fact-Check:Claim Being Evaluated: Marielle Leraand claimed that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country.Verdict Category: Mixed;Mixed Verdict: Most Ukrainians Want Peace Talks, But Not Majority Support for Ceding Land, Fact-Check Finds;Claim Being Evaluated: Marielle Leraand, leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), claimed during NRK's Debatten on May 20 that a Gallup poll showed a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country.Key Evidence and Verdict: The Gallup poll from August and October 2024, published in November 2024, confirmed that 52% of respondents wanted Ukraine to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible, supporting part of Leraand’s claim. However, the claim that a majority wanted to give up land is inaccurate. Only those favoring negotiations (52%) were asked about ceding territory, with 52% of that group (not the total sample) agreeing to it, while 38% opposed and 9% were unsure. Additionally, 38% of all respondents preferred continuing to fight until victory, a decline from 73% in 2022 and 63% in 2023. Other surveys, like those from the Kyiv Institute of Sociology, show 38% willingness to cede land for peace, with 51% opposed. The surveys exclude 10–12% of the population in occupied territories, and question wording significantly impacts results. Verdict: Leraand’s claim is partly true—52% of Ukrainians support peace negotiations—but misleading, as it inaccurately suggests a majority support giving up land.;1. Claim Being Evaluated: Marielle Leraand, leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), claimed during NRK's Debatten on May 20 that a Gallup poll showed a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country.2. Verdict: Mixed3. Explanation: The Gallup poll from August and October 2024 confirms that 52% of Ukrainians surveyed supported peace negotiations as soon as possible, validating the first part of Leraand’s claim. However, the claim that a majority want to give up land is inaccurate. Only 52% of those favoring negotiations (not the overall sample) supported ceding land, with 38% opposing and 9% unsure. Additionally, 38% of all respondents favored continuing the fight until victory. Supporting evidence from the Kyiv Institute of Sociology shows 38% willingness to cede land for peace, while 51% opposed it. The claim is partially true regarding support for negotiations but misleading on the extent of support for giving up land.

This claim is promoted by influencer Thomas Thrap Huse (Pimp Lotion) and the company Vannrenser.no.---2. What is the final verdict?False---3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict? Official health and water authorities refute the claim: The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) states that water from public waterworks is safe to drink and does not require filtering. The Oslo Water and Sewage Administration confirms frequent testing of drinking water, including for PFAS, and reports compliance with all safety standards. PFAS are present but at low levels: Studies found low levels of PFAS in Maridalsvannet, below the strictest international limits. PFAS are ubiquitous in the environment, but drinking water is not a major source of human exposure—food is. Misleading use of authority: Vannrenser.no used the FHI logo and referenced FHI content without proper context, leading FHI to request corrections and removal of their logo. The company only partially complied, raising concerns about misrepresentation. Scientific consensus does not support the need for home filters: Experts, including from NIVA, say reverse osmosis filters may be useful in specific, high-risk areas (e.g., private wells near contamination), not for public water in Oslo.---Summary Verdict:The claim that Oslo’s drinking water is so polluted it requires home filtration is false, based on expert assessments, scientific evidence, and regulatory oversight.;Fact Check: Oslo's Drinking Water Is Safe, Filters Unnecessary Despite Pollution Claims;1. What is the claim being verified in this fact-check?The claim being verified is that Oslo's drinking water from Maridalen is so polluted, particularly with PFAS, that it necessitates the purchase of a water filter (specifically, a reverse osmosis filter) to purify it for safe consumption, leading to benefits like increased energy and reduced brain fog.

The claim suggests that such filters remove all contaminants, leading to increased energy levels and reduced brain fog. Additionally, the claim emphasizes PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) as a significant pollutant in the water, necessitating filtration.2. What is the conclusion and what are the key reasons behind this?The conclusion is that the claim is misleading and not supported by evidence. Oslo's drinking water, including from Maridalsvannet, is safe and meets all requirements of the Drinking Water Regulations, as confirmed by the Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI). Key reasons include:- High-Quality Monitoring: Weekly sampling and extensive testing at water treatment plants and pipelines ensure the water is safe. PFAS levels in Maridalsvannet are very low, below international drinking water limits, and not a significant health concern.- FHI's Position: FHI states that purifying drinking water from public waterworks with filters is unnecessary, as the water is already treated to be safe. FHI also criticized Vannrenser.no for misusing its name and logo to imply endorsement, which the company partially addressed by removing the logo but not fully complying with FHI's requests.- PFAS Context: While PFAS are present in the environment and human blood, drinking water is not a primary source of exposure in Norway. Food is a more significant source, and PFAS levels in Oslo’s water are minimal and well below regulatory limits.- Expert Input: Researcher Cathrine Brecke Gundersen from NIVA confirms that PFAS in public water supplies in southern Norway, including Maridalsvannet, are at low levels and not a significant risk. Filters may only be relevant for private water sources near high-risk areas, such as firefighting training sites.The claims by Vannrenser.no and Thomas Thrap Huse lack a balanced or fact-based foundation, as the water quality is rigorously monitored and deemed safe.; Verdict of the Fact-Check1.

The claim is promoted through TikTok and the website Vannrenser.no, suggesting that the filter improves health by removing all contaminants, increasing energy levels, and reducing brain fog.---2. Evidence (Assessment of the Claim):Water Quality and PFAS Presence:According to Toril Giske from the Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration, Oslo’s drinking water (including from Maridalsvannet) is safe, meets all legal standards, and is regularly tested—including for PFAS.PFAS have been detected in very small amounts (3 of 17 compounds), but these levels are well below regulatory limits and are not considered dangerous.Cathrine Brecke Gundersen from NIVA confirms that while PFAS are present in the environment and human blood, drinking water is not a significant source of PFAS exposure in Norway. Food is a more relevant source.PFAS levels in Oslo water were investigated and confirmed to be very low, not posing health risks under current standards.Regulatory and Institutional Response:The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) states that it is not necessary to use filters to purify municipal drinking water.FHI also requested Vannrenser.no to remove misleading references to the institute, including improper use of its logo, which the company only partially complied with.Commercial Interest and Misleading Advertising:Vannrenser.no is advertising reverse osmosis filters and is using health-based claims and influencer endorsements (e.g., Pimp Lotion) that are not supported by scientific evidence.The claims about filters improving energy or reducing brain fog are not backed by credible scientific sources and may be misleading.---3. Conclusion (Final Verdict and Justification):The claim that Oslo’s drinking water is so polluted that it requires additional filtering is misleading and not supported by facts.Verdict: False or MisleadingReasoning:Oslo’s drinking water is safe, regularly tested, and complies with regulations, including low levels of PFAS.No public health authority (FHI, NIVA, or the Water and Sewage Administration) recommends reverse osmosis filters for households using municipal water.Marketing tactics by Vannrenser.no, including endorsements and references to public institutions, give a distorted view of water safety and are not grounded in verified science.---Assertion: Oslo’s drinking water is so polluted that consumers should use a reverse osmosis filter to protect their health.Conclusion: The claim is not supported by scientific or regulatory evidence, Oslo’s drinking water is considered safe, and filters are unnecessary for public water supplies.;Sure! Here's the fact-check analysis using the three requested steps:--- 1. Identify the Claim Being Evaluated:The central claim is that Oslo's drinking water from Maridalsvannet is so polluted—particularly with PFAS “forever chemicals”—that it is necessary to use a reverse osmosis filter to make it safe for drinking. This claim is made by influencer Thomas Thrap Huse (Pimp Lotion) and promoted through the company Vannrenser.no.--- 2. Review of Key Evidence Provided: Water Safety According to Authorities: Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI): States that it is not necessary to purify water from municipal waterworks using filters, as it is already treated and safe to drink. Oslo Water and Sewage Administration: Confirms that Oslo’s water is continuously monitored, meets all safety standards, and that PFAS levels are very low, well below regulatory thresholds. Scientific Perspective on PFAS: Cathrine Brecke Gundersen (NIVA): Acknowledges PFAS are present in the environment and in trace amounts in drinking water, but emphasizes that drinking water is not a significant source of exposure. Food and consumer products are larger contributors. Tests conducted on Maridalsvannet: Detected PFAS in only 3 out of 17 compounds tested, at very low levels. Commercial Practices by Vannrenser.no: Vannrenser.no used FHI’s name and logo in a misleading manner, implying endorsement. FHI explicitly asked the company to remove references that could mislead consumers, suggesting the marketing was inappropriately leveraging public authority credibility. The company's health claims about increased energy and reduced brain fog from filtered water are unsupported by scientific evidence.--- 3. Verdict: ?? False Justification: Oslo’s drinking water, including from Maridalsvannet, is safe and compliant with national and international standards. The levels of PFAS detected are minimal and not harmful according to current health risk assessments. No scientific or regulatory support exists for the claim that reverse osmosis filters are necessary for people using municipal water in Oslo. The claim appears to be driven by commercial interests and misrepresents expert guidance and water quality data.--- ? Final Verdict: FalseThe assertion that Oslo's drinking water is too polluted to drink without a filter is not supported by scientific evidence or public health authorities.;Fact Check: Oslo's Drinking Water from Maridalen is Safe, Filters Unnecessary Despite Influencer Claims;1. Assertion:Influencer Thomas Thrap Huse (Pimp Lotion) and the company Vannrenser.no claim that Oslo's drinking water from Maridalen is so polluted, particularly with PFAS, that it necessitates the purchase of a reverse osmosis water filter. They assert that this filter will remove absolutely all contaminants, leading to increased energy levels and the elimination of brain fog. Vannrenser.no also implies endorsement from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) on its website.2. Evidence:Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI): FHI explicitly states that It is not necessary to purify drinking water from a waterworks with a filter or other post-treatment. They clarify that waterworks treat water to make it safe. FHI has also requested Vannrenser.no to remove misleading references and their logo from the company's website.Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration: Toril Giske, functional manager for water quality, confirms that Oslo's drinking water, including from Maridalsvannet, is safe and meets all requirements in the drinking water regulations. They conduct weekly sampling and extensive monitoring.Norwegian Institute for Water Research (NIVA): Cathrine Brecke Gundersen, an environmental chemicals researcher at NIVA, states that while PFAS are found almost everywhere, including in Maridalsvannet, the levels in Oslo's drinking water are very low and below the most stringent international drinking water limits. She emphasizes that drinking water is not considered a significant source of PFAS exposure, with food being the most important source for humans. Gundersen generally believes it's unnecessary to use a reverse osmosis filter in Norway for public water supplies, recommending awareness of PFAS in consumer products instead.3. Conclusion:The claim that Oslo's drinking water from Maridalen is so polluted it requires a water filter is false.The Norwegian Institute of Public Health, the Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration, and the Norwegian Institute for Water Research all confirm that Oslo's tap water is safe, regularly tested, and meets all quality standards. While low levels of PFAS are detected, they are well below prescribed limits and drinking water is not the main source of human exposure to these substances. The suggestion that a reverse osmosis filter is necessary or will remove absolutely all contaminants and provide health benefits like increased energy or reduced brain fog is unsubstantiated and contradicts expert advice. Furthermore, Vannrenser.no's association with FHI is misleading and has been disavowed by FHI.;1. Claim Being Evaluated:The central claim is that Oslo's drinking water from Maridalen is so polluted, particularly with PFAS, that it necessitates the purchase of a water filter (specifically, a reverse osmosis filter) to purify it, and that such filters can lead to increased energy levels and the elimination of brain fog. The company Vannrenser.no also implies the endorsement of the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) for this claim and their products.2. Key Evidence Provided: Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI): Explicitly states, It is not necessary to purify drinking water from a waterworks with a filter or other post-treatment. FHI clarifies that waterworks treat water to make it safe to drink. FHI also demanded that Vannrenser.no moderate references and remove FHI's logo from their website due to misleading content. Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration (Toril Giske): Confirms that drinking water in Oslo, including from Maridalsvannet, is safe and meets all requirements in the drinking water regulations. She states that claims about water quality in the podcast do not provide a balanced or fact-based picture. They conduct weekly and quarterly tests for various compounds, including 17 different PFAS compounds, and found very low values that are well below the prescribed limit value in Maridalsvannet. Norwegian Institute for Water Research (NIVA - Cathrine Brecke Gundersen): Acknowledges that PFAS are found almost everywhere, but emphasizes that the levels in drinking water from public waterworks in Southern Norway (including Maridalsvannet) are low and therefore drinking water is not considered a significant source. She points out that the most important source of PFAS for humans is the food we eat. Gundersen generally believes it's not necessary to use a reverse osmosis filter in Norway for public water sources.3. Verdict and Justification:Verdict: FalseJustification:The claim that Oslo's drinking water from Maridalen is so polluted it requires a filter, and that such filters provide the advertised health benefits, is demonstrably false based on the evidence: Safety of Oslo's Drinking Water: All expert sources (FHI, Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration, NIVA) unequivocally state that Oslo's drinking water from public waterworks, including Maridalen, is safe, meets all regulatory requirements, and is suitable for drinking without further purification. Extensive and frequent testing confirms this. PFAS Levels: While PFAS are present, the levels in Oslo's drinking water are very low and well below national and international limits, meaning it is not a significant source of PFAS exposure for humans. The primary source is food. Necessity of Filters: Experts from FHI and NIVA explicitly state that it is not necessary to purify water from a waterworks with a filter. Misleading Health Claims: The claims about increased energy and elimination of brain fog due to filtering public drinking water are not supported by any credible scientific evidence presented. Misuse of FHI's Name: Vannrenser.no's attempt to associate itself with FHI is misleading and has been directly challenged by FHI, further undermining the company's credibility.Therefore, the core assertion of the claim is contradicted by all authoritative sources.;False Claim: Oslo's Drinking Water Not So Polluted That Filters Are Necessary;Assertion: The claim being evaluated is that Oslo's drinking water from Maridalen is so polluted that it's advisable to purchase a water filter to purify drinking water, as stated by influencer Thomas Thrap Huse (Pimp Lotion) and the company Vannrenser.no.Main Evidence:The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) states that it's not necessary to purify drinking water from a waterworks with a filter or other post-treatment.The Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration confirms that Oslo's drinking water, including from Maridalsvannet, is safe and meets all requirements in the drinking water regulations.Tests conducted by the Water and Wastewater Agency show that the water quality is high, with frequent sampling at water treatment plants and pipeline networks.Researcher Cathrine Brecke Gundersen from NIVA states that PFAS levels in drinking water in Southern Norway, including Maridalsvannet, are low and below international drinking water limits.Conclusion: The fact-check concludes that the claim is unfounded. According to the evidence, Oslo's drinking water is safe and meets all requirements, and the levels of PFAS are low and not considered a significant source of exposure. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health and the Water and Wastewater Agency recommend no additional filtration for public water supplies.

The authorities and experts confirm that the drinking water is safe, and the levels of PFAS are low and not considered a significant source of exposure. The company's claims about the need for a reverse osmosis filter appear to be exaggerated and not justified by the evidence.;Oslo’s Drinking Water Safe: Claims of Pollution and Need for Filters Proven False;Claim Being Evaluated (Assertion)The core claim is that Oslo's drinking water from Maridalen is so polluted, particularly with PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances), that residents are advised to purchase a reverse osmosis water filter to purify it. This claim is made by influencer Thomas Thrap Huse (Pimp Lotion) and promoted by the company Vannrenser.no, which sells these filters, asserting they remove all contaminants and can improve energy levels and reduce brain fog.2. Main Evidence ProvidedThe fact-check evaluates the claim using multiple sources and data points:- Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI): FHI's senior advisor, Marianne Steinberg, states that drinking water from public waterworks, including Oslo’s, does not require purification via filters. FHI also requested Vannrenser.no to remove their logo and moderate references to FHI, as these gave a misleading impression of FHI’s stance.- Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration (Toril Giske): Giske confirms that Oslo’s drinking water, including from Maridalsvannet, meets all regulatory requirements and is safe. Weekly sampling and quarterly PFAS testing show that PFAS levels in Maridalsvannet are very low (3 out of 17 compounds detected, well below regulatory limits) and undetectable in Elvåga in 2024. The water quality is continuously monitored.- Norwegian Institute for Water Research (NIVA): Researcher Cathrine Brecke Gundersen notes that PFAS is present in low levels in Maridalsvannet, below stringent international drinking water limits. She emphasizes that drinking water is not a significant source of PFAS exposure compared to food. Gundersen suggests that reverse osmosis filters are unnecessary for public water supplies in Norway but may be relevant for private water sources near high-risk areas (e.g., firefighting training sites).- Context on PFAS: PFAS are widespread forever chemicals found in various products, but their levels in Oslo’s drinking water are not significant enough to pose a health risk, and food is identified as the primary exposure source.3. Verdict and Reasoning (Conclusion)Verdict: The claim that Oslo’s drinking water from Maridalen is so polluted that a reverse osmosis filter is necessary is false.Reasoning: The evidence from authoritative sources (FHI, Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration, and NIVA) confirms that Oslo’s drinking water is safe and meets regulatory standards. PFAS levels in Maridalsvannet are low and well below safety limits, and drinking water is not a significant source of PFAS exposure. The claims by Vannrenser.no and Thomas Thrap Huse exaggerate the pollution levels and lack scientific backing. Additionally, FHI’s request for Vannrenser.no to remove misleading references indicates the company’s promotional tactics may misrepresent official health advice. Reverse osmosis filters are deemed unnecessary for public water supplies in Norway, though they could be relevant for specific private sources near contaminated sites. The claims about increased energy and reduced brain fog lack evidence and are not supported by the fact-check.; Fact-Check Verdict Determination 1. Claim Being EvaluatedThe claim is that Oslo's drinking water from Maridalen is so polluted, particularly with PFAS, that residents are advised to purchase a reverse osmosis water filter to purify it. This claim is made by influencer Thomas Thrap Huse (Pimp Lotion) and promoted by Vannrenser.no, which also suggests that such filters can remove all contaminants, leading to increased energy levels and reduced brain fog. 2. Key Evidence Provided- Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI): Senior advisor Marianne Steinberg states that drinking water from public waterworks, including Oslo’s, does not require purification with filters. FHI requested Vannrenser.no to remove their logo and moderate references, as these misrepresented FHI’s position.- Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration (Toril Giske): Oslo’s drinking water, including from Maridalsvannet, meets all regulatory requirements and is safe. Weekly sampling and quarterly PFAS testing show low PFAS levels in Maridalsvannet (3 out of 17 compounds detected, well below limits) and none in Elvåga in 2024.- Norwegian Institute for Water Research (NIVA): Researcher Cathrine Brecke Gundersen confirms PFAS is present in Maridalsvannet at low levels, below international drinking water limits. Drinking water is not a significant PFAS exposure source compared to food. Reverse osmosis filters are unnecessary for public water supplies but may be relevant for private sources near high-risk areas.- PFAS Context: Food, not drinking water, is the primary source of PFAS exposure. Claims about energy improvement and brain fog reduction lack scientific support. 3. Verdict and JustificationVerdict: FalseJustification: The claim that Oslo’s drinking water from Maridalen is so polluted that a reverse osmosis filter is necessary is contradicted by authoritative evidence. FHI, the Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration, and NIVA confirm that Oslo’s drinking water is safe, with PFAS levels well below regulatory limits. Drinking water is not a significant PFAS exposure source, and filters are unnecessary for public supplies. The additional claims about energy and brain fog benefits are unsupported. Vannrenser.no’s misleading use of FHI’s name further undermines the claim’s credibility. The evidence shows no basis for advising filters for Oslo’s public water supply.

It ends up in Maridalsvannet and is not cleaned. I can guarantee you that the water you get from the tap contains a lot of crap.Thomas Thrap Huse (Pimp Lotion), republished by @vannrenser.no on TikTokConclusion:The drinking water in Oslo undergoes rigorous testing, is monitored weekly, and meets all requirements of the Drinking Water Regulations. It is safe to drink, and a water filter is not necessary. PFAS can occur in drinking water, but the levels are well below safe limits.;This is the fact-check: According to influencer and artist Thomas Thrap Huse (Pimp Lotion);Contextual;Oslo Drinking Water Is Not Polluted Enough to Require Filters — Claim by Influencer and Company Is False;1. The Claim:Influencer Thomas Thrap Huse (Pimp Lotion) and the company Vannrenser.no claim that Oslo’s drinking water from Maridalen is heavily polluted, necessitating the purchase of reverse osmosis water filters to remove all contaminants, including PFAS, to improve health and cognitive function.2. The Evidence:The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) and the Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration confirm that Oslo’s drinking water meets all safety requirements and is regularly tested, showing safe quality.PFAS chemicals, while present in the environment and detectable at very low levels in some water sources, are below stringent international safety limits in Oslo’s water. The main source of PFAS exposure for humans is food, not drinking water.FHI requested Vannrenser.no to remove misleading references to their endorsement, the company has not fully complied.Experts from the Norwegian Institute for Water Research (NIVA) say reverse osmosis filters are generally unnecessary for public water supplies and are recommended mainly for private wells near contamination sites.3. The Verdict:False ;Sure! Here’s the final verdict based on the fact-check:---1. What is the claim being assessed?The claim is that Oslo’s drinking water from Maridalen is heavily polluted with contaminants such as PFAS, making it necessary for residents to buy reverse osmosis water filters (as promoted by influencer Thomas Thrap Huse and Vannrenser.no) to purify their water for health benefits like increased energy and reduced brain fog.2. What is the verdict?False ;Claim that Oslo's Maridalen Drinking Water is Polluted and Needs Filtering is False;Assertion: Influencer Thomas Thrap Huse (Pimp Lotion) and the company Vannrenser.no claim that Oslo's drinking water from Maridalen is severely polluted, particularly with PFAS, necessitating the purchase of a reverse osmosis water filter to purify it, which they assert will remove all contaminants and improve health (e.g., increased energy, reduced brain fog). Vannrenser.no also implies endorsement from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI).Evidence: The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) explicitly states that purifying public drinking water with a filter is not necessary as waterworks treat water to make it safe, FHI has also requested Vannrenser.no to remove misleading references and their logo from their website. Toril Giske, from the Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration, confirms Oslo's drinking water (including Maridalsvannet) is safe, meets all regulations, and is frequently tested, with PFAS levels being very low values that are well below the prescribed limit value.

Expert sources from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, the Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration, and the Norwegian Institute for Water Research unanimously confirm that Oslo's drinking water is safe, regularly monitored, and meets all quality standards, rendering water filters unnecessary for public supplies. PFAS levels are present but are very low and not considered a significant health concern from drinking water, with food being the primary source of exposure. The health benefits attributed to filtering by Vannrenser.no are unsubstantiated, and their implied endorsement by FHI is misleading.;1. What is the claim being assessed?The claim being assessed is that Oslo's drinking water from Maridalen is so polluted, particularly with PFAS, that it necessitates the purchase of a water filter (specifically, a reverse osmosis filter) to purify it. Furthermore, it is claimed that using such filters will remove absolutely all contaminants and lead to health benefits such as increased energy levels and the elimination of brain fog. The company promoting these filters, Vannrenser.no, also implies endorsement from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI).2. What is the verdict?False3. What reasoning or evidence supports this decision?The decision is supported by overwhelming evidence from multiple authoritative sources: Safety of Oslo's Drinking Water: The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) explicitly states that it is not necessary to purify drinking water from a waterworks with a filter or other post-treatment because waterworks treat the water to make it safe to drink. The Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration confirms that Oslo's drinking water, including that from Maridalsvannet, is safe and meets all requirements in the drinking water regulations and undergoes frequent testing to ensure high quality. Low PFAS Levels: While PFAS are detected in Maridalsvannet, researchers from the Norwegian Institute for Water Research (NIVA) confirm these levels are very low and below the most stringent international drinking water limits. They emphasize that drinking water is not considered a significant source of PFAS exposure, with food being the most important source for humans. Unnecessary Filtration: Experts from both FHI and NIVA concur that using a reverse osmosis filter for public water supplies in Norway is generally unnecessary. Unsupported Health Claims: The claims of increased energy levels and elimination of brain fog from filtering public drinking water are presented without any supporting evidence from the expert sources cited in the fact-check. Misleading FHI Association: The fact-check reveals that Vannrenser.no has been asked by FHI to moderate references to them and remove their logo, as FHI believes the company's content gives a wrong impression, indicating a deceptive use of FHI's name to lend credibility.;False Claim: Oslo's Drinking Water Not Polluted to the Extent That Filters Are Necessary, Say Health and Water Authorities;The Claim: Influencer Thomas Thrap Huse (Pimp Lotion) and company Vannrenser.no claim that Oslo's drinking water from Maridalen is polluted and advise purchasing a water filter to purify drinking water.The Evidence:The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) states that it's not necessary to purify drinking water from a waterworks with a filter or other post-treatment.The Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration conducts frequent tests to ensure high water quality, and tests show Oslo's drinking water meets all requirements.Researchers found low levels of PFAS in Maridalsvannet, but levels are below international drinking water limits.Experts agree that food is the main source of PFAS exposure, not drinking water.The Verdict: The claim is largely false. According to the evidence, Oslo's drinking water is safe and meets all requirements, and using a reverse osmosis filter is not necessary for public water supplies.

The Claim: Influencer Thomas Thrap Huse (Pimp Lotion) and Vannrenser.no claim that Oslo’s drinking water from Maridalen is so polluted, particularly with PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances), that residents should purchase reverse osmosis water filters to purify it. The filters are said to remove all contaminants, potentially increasing energy levels and reducing brain fog.2. The Evidence:- Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI): FHI states that drinking water from public waterworks, including Oslo’s, is safe and does not require additional filtration. FHI requested Vannrenser.no to remove its logo and moderate references to FHI, as they gave a misleading impression.- Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration (Toril Giske): Oslo’s drinking water, including from Maridalsvannet, meets all regulatory requirements. Weekly sampling and quarterly PFAS testing show very low PFAS levels, well below regulatory limits. No PFAS compounds were detected in Elvåga samples in 2024, and only trace amounts (3 out of 17 compounds) were found in Maridalsvannet.- Norwegian Institute for Water Research (NIVA, Cathrine Brecke Gundersen): PFAS is present in low levels in southern Norway’s drinking water, including Maridalsvannet, but these are below international limits. Drinking water is not a significant PFAS exposure source, food is the primary source. Filters may be relevant for private wells near contaminated sites but are generally unnecessary for public water supplies.- Additional Context: PFAS, known as “forever chemicals,” are widespread due to their use in products like ski lubricants and firefighting foams. While some PFAS are linked to health risks, levels in Oslo’s water are minimal and not a significant concern.3. The Verdict: The claim is false. Oslo’s drinking water from Maridalen is safe and meets regulatory standards, with low PFAS levels that do not pose a health risk. Extensive monitoring by the Water and Sewage Administration and research from NIVA confirm that additional filtration is unnecessary for public water supplies. The claim exaggerates the pollution level and the need for filters, which are not supported by scientific evidence for general use in Oslo.;Final Verdict on Fact-Check Regarding Oslo’s Drinking Water1. Claim Being Assessed: Influencer Thomas Thrap Huse (Pimp Lotion) and Vannrenser.no claim that Oslo’s drinking water from Maridalen is so polluted, particularly with PFAS, that residents need to purchase reverse osmosis water filters to purify it. These filters are claimed to remove all contaminants, potentially boosting energy levels and reducing brain fog.2. Verdict: The claim is false.3. Reasoning and Evidence Supporting the Verdict:- Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI): FHI confirms that drinking water from public waterworks, including Oslo’s, is safe and does not require additional filtration. FHI criticized Vannrenser.no for misleading references and requested the removal of its logo and certain claims.- Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration (Toril Giske): Oslo’s drinking water, including from Maridalsvannet, complies with drinking water regulations. Weekly sampling and quarterly PFAS testing show either no detectable PFAS (in Elvåga) or very low levels (3 out of 17 compounds in Maridalsvannet), well below regulatory limits.- Norwegian Institute for Water Research (NIVA, Cathrine Brecke Gundersen): PFAS levels in southern Norway’s drinking water, including Maridalsvannet, are low and below international safety limits. Drinking water is not a significant source of PFAS exposure compared to food. Filters are unnecessary for public water supplies but may be relevant for private wells near contaminated sites.- The claim exaggerates the extent of pollution and the necessity of filters, which is not supported by scientific evidence or monitoring data. The promotion of filters for health benefits like increased energy and reduced brain fog lacks substantiation, further undermining the claim’s validity.

Experts advise that water filters like reverse osmosis systems are generally unnecessary for public water supplies and are mainly recommended only for private sources exposed to specific contamination. Therefore, the suggestion that Oslo’s water is dangerously polluted and requires home filtration is misleading and contradicted by scientific monitoring and official health guidelines.;Here’s the verdict breakdown:---1. What is the claim being evaluated?The claim is that Oslo’s drinking water from Maridalen is heavily polluted with contaminants like PFAS, making it necessary to buy and use reverse osmosis water filters to purify the water for safety and health benefits.2. Based on the evidence provided, is the claim true, false, mixed or another verdict category?The verdict is false.3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict? Official authorities (Norwegian Institute of Public Health and Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration) confirm Oslo’s water is safe, regularly tested, and meets all regulatory standards. PFAS levels in the water are very low and below strict international limits. The main PFAS exposure for people is through food, not water. The company promoting the filters misused FHI’s name and was asked to remove misleading references. Experts say reverse osmosis filters are unnecessary for public water supplies like Oslo’s and are recommended only in specific cases with known contamination.--- Final Verdict:The claim that Oslo’s drinking water from Maridalen is so polluted that people need reverse osmosis filters for safety and health reasons is false. Comprehensive testing and official statements show the water is safe and well-regulated, and the contamination levels do not justify the need for such filters. The claim is based on misleading information and is contradicted by scientific evidence and public health authorities.;Fact Check: Oslo's Drinking Water from Maridalen is Safe, Filters Not Needed Despite Pollution Claims;1. Assertion: Influencer Thomas Thrap Huse and the company Vannrenser.no claim that Oslo's drinking water from Maridalen is so polluted, particularly with PFAS, that a reverse osmosis filter is necessary to purify it for consumption, leading to increased energy and reduced brain fog.2. Conclusion: The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) and the Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration refute the claim, stating that Oslo's drinking water is safe, meets all regulations, and does not require additional filtering. While PFAS are present at very low levels in Maridalsvannet, they are well below international drinking water limits and food is considered the primary source of PFAS exposure for humans, not drinking water. Vannrenser.no has also been asked by FHI to remove misleading references to their institution.Influencer Thomas Thrap Huse and Vannrenser.no assert that Oslo's drinking water from Maridalen is significantly polluted, particularly by PFAS, and advocate for the purchase of reverse osmosis filters to purify it, claiming benefits like increased energy and reduced brain fog. However, both the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) and the Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration firmly refute these claims. They state that Oslo's drinking water is rigorously tested weekly, meets all drinking water regulations, and is safe to drink without further treatment. While PFAS are detected in Maridalsvannet, the levels are extremely low and well below stringent international drinking water limits. Experts from the Norwegian Institute for Water Research (NIVA) confirm that drinking water is not a significant source of PFAS exposure for humans, with food being the primary contributor. Furthermore, FHI has formally requested Vannrenser.no to remove misleading references and logos from their website, indicating the company's inappropriate use of FHI's name to promote their products. Therefore, the evidence strongly refutes the assertion that Oslo's drinking water is polluted to a degree that necessitates a filter for safety or health benefits.;1. What is the claim being evaluated? The claim is that Oslo's drinking water from Maridalen is so polluted, especially with PFAS, that a water filter (specifically a reverse osmosis filter) is necessary to purify it, which in turn can lead to increased energy levels and help get rid of brain fog.2. Based on the evidence provided, is the claim true, false, mixed or another verdict category? False.3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict? The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) explicitly states that it is not necessary to purify drinking water from a waterworks with a filter, as the water is treated to be safe to drink. The Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration confirms that Oslo's drinking water, including from Maridalsvannet, is safe, meets all requirements, and is frequently tested. While PFAS are present in Maridalsvannet, they are at very low levels, well below international drinking water limits, and drinking water is not considered a significant source of PFAS exposure for humans, with food being the main source. Additionally, FHI has asked Vannrenser.no to moderate misleading references to their institution, further undermining the credibility of the company's claims.Verdict: False.

Therefore, using a water filter is not necessary for most people.;Oslo’s Drinking Water Declared Safe: Claims of Pollution and Need for Filters Debunked;Claim Being Evaluated: Influencer Thomas Thrap Huse (Pimp Lotion) and Vannrenser.no claim that Oslo's drinking water from Maridalen is so polluted, particularly with PFAS, that a reverse osmosis water filter is necessary to purify it, with benefits including increased energy and reduced brain fog.Key Evidence and Verdict: The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) and the Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration state that Oslo’s drinking water, including from Maridalsvannet, is safe and meets all regulatory standards, with weekly testing confirming high quality. PFAS levels in Maridalsvannet are low, below international limits, and drinking water is not a significant PFAS exposure source compared to food. FHI requested Vannrenser.no to remove misleading references and their logo, indicating the company’s claims may exaggerate water quality issues. Researcher Cathrine Brecke Gundersen from NIVA confirms that reverse osmosis filters are generally unnecessary for public water supplies in Norway, though they may be relevant for private wells near contaminated sites. Verdict: The claim is misleading, Oslo’s drinking water is safe, and the need for filters is not supported by evidence for most consumers.;1. Claim Being Evaluated: Influencer Thomas Thrap Huse (Pimp Lotion) and Vannrenser.no claim that Oslo's drinking water from Maridalen is so polluted, particularly with PFAS, that a reverse osmosis water filter is necessary to purify it, with benefits including increased energy and reduced brain fog.2. Verdict: False3. Explanation: The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) and the Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration confirm that Oslo’s drinking water, including from Maridalsvannet, is safe, meeting all regulatory standards with regular testing. PFAS levels are low, below international limits, and drinking water is not a significant PFAS exposure source compared to food. FHI criticized Vannrenser.no for misleading references, and NIVA’s researcher stated that reverse osmosis filters are generally unnecessary for public water supplies in Norway. The claims about pollution and health benefits from filters lack evidence and exaggerate the issue.

Claim Being Verified: The claim is that videos circulating on social media, particularly on TikTok, accurately depict U.S. attacks on Iran's nuclear facilities (Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan) on June 22, 2025, with additional claims that other videos show Iranian attacks against Israel.2. Final Verdict: False3. Evidence and Reasoning Supporting the Verdict:- A widely shared TikTok video, purportedly showing a U.S. attack on the Fordow facility, was analyzed using a reverse image search on Google. The search revealed that the video likely depicts a Ukrainian attack on a Russian ammunition depot in Toropets, Tver region, in September 2024, which was powerful enough to affect seismometers in Norway. This video was used by reputable media outlets like Reuters, NRK, TV2, The Guardian, and CNN in coverage of the Ukrainian attack, not a U.S. attack on Iran.- Another video claimed to show the Fordow attack was found through reverse image search to have been shared in December 2024, including by Belgian EU MP Marc Botenga on X, and is associated with an Israeli attack on the Syrian coastal city of Tartus following the fall of the Assad regime, as reported by outlets like the Daily Mail.- A third video, claimed to show Iranian attacks against Israel, was identified via reverse image search on YouTube as footage from the 103rd anniversary celebration of the Algerian football club Mouloudia Club, confirmed by Google searches linking the video to the club's celebration.- The consistent mismatch between the claimed content and the actual events depicted in the videos, verified through reverse image searches and credible media reports, demonstrates that none of the videos show U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities or Iranian attacks on Israel, rendering the claims false.

Claim Being EvaluatedThat multiple widely shared videos on social media show U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities—specifically Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan—on the night of Sunday, June 22.--- 2. Key Evidence Provided Video 1: Claimed to show the Fordow strike. A reverse image search indicates it actually depicts a Ukrainian attack on a Russian ammunition depot in Toropets in September 2024. Multiple international outlets (e.g., CNN, The Guardian) reported it in that context. Video 2: Also claimed to show the Fordow attack. Found to be from an Israeli strike on Tartus, Syria in December 2024. It was used in media coverage of that event, including by Daily Mail. Video 3: Allegedly shows Iranian attacks against Israel, but a reverse image search reveals it’s actually from a football celebration in Algeria for Mouloudia Club's 103rd anniversary, confirmed by YouTube posts and simple keyword searches.--- 3. Verdict: FalseThe claim that these viral videos show U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities is false. Each of the videos analyzed originates from entirely different contexts and timeframes, as confirmed through reverse image searches and media reporting. None of the footage reliably documents the June 22 attacks, and the social media posts sharing them are misleading.;Viral Videos Falsely Claim to Show US Attacks on Iranian Nuclear Sites, But Bombings Did Occur.;Social media claims that the United States bombed three Iranian nuclear facilities on the night of Sunday, June 22, are false, as multiple widely shared videos purporting to show these attacks are, in fact, miscontextualized footage from a Ukrainian attack on a Russian ammunition depot in September 2024, an Israeli attack on the Syrian city of Tartus in December 2024, and a Mouloudia Club football anniversary celebration in Algeria.;1. Claim being evaluated: The core claim being evaluated is that the United States bombed the three Iranian nuclear facilities of Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan on the night of Sunday, June 22, and that this attack put Iran's nuclear program out of action, as evidenced by dramatic videos circulating on social media.2. Key evidence provided: The fact-check explicitly states that many of these clips turn out to be from completely different times and events. A widely shared video purporting to show the Fordow attack is identified, through reverse image search, as likely showing a Ukrainian attack on a Russian ammunition depot in Toropets in September 2024. Another video claimed to show the Fordow attack is identified, through reverse image search, as having been shared in December 2024, allegedly showing an Israeli attack on the Syrian coastal city of Tartus. A third widely shared video, claimed to show Iranian attacks against Israel, is identified, through reverse image search, as being from the celebration of the Algerian football club Mouloudia Club's 103rd anniversary. While the provided fact-check focuses on debunking the videos, current events (as of June 27, 2025) indicate that the US did conduct strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities on June 22, 2025. This introduces a crucial nuance: the event itself may have occurred, but the videos purporting to show it are false.3. Verdict: Mixed. False (regarding the videos): The claims that the specific widely shared social media videos depict the US attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities are FALSE. The evidence clearly shows these videos are recycled footage from unrelated events (a Ukrainian attack in Russia, an Israeli attack in Syria, and an Algerian football celebration). True (regarding the event): While the fact-check's primary focus is on the misattributed videos, it's important to acknowledge, based on current search results, that the United States did reportedly conduct strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities (Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan) on June 22, 2025. Therefore, the core assertion that US bombings occurred is true, but the visual evidence being presented on social media for these attacks is demonstrably false. The fact-check accurately debunks the visual evidence, but the underlying event is reported to have taken place.;Videos Claiming to Show US Strikes on Iran's Nuclear Facilities Are Misleading;Social media videos claiming to show US attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities and Iranian attacks on Israel have been debunked as misinformation, with reverse image searches revealing the footage actually shows unrelated events, including a Ukrainian attack on a Russian ammunition depot and an Algerian football club's anniversary celebration.Meta AI response: Social media videos claiming to show US attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities and Iranian attacks on Israel have been debunked as misinformation, with reverse image searches revealing the footage actually shows unrelated events, including a Ukrainian attack on a Russian ammunition depot and an Algerian football club's anniversary celebration.;That sounds like a solid fact-check lead.

It clearly states the claim being evaluated, the verdict, and gives a brief overview of the evidence that led to that conclusion. Well done!;Viral Videos Falsely Claimed to Show U.S. Attacks on Iranian Nuclear Sites and Iranian Strikes on Israel;Social media videos claiming to show U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities on June 22, 2025, or Iranian attacks on Israel are false, as reverse image searches and media reports confirm they depict unrelated events, including a Ukrainian attack on a Russian depot, an Israeli strike on Syria, and an Algerian football club celebration.; Step 1: Identify the Claim Being EvaluatedThe claim being evaluated is that videos widely shared on social media, particularly on TikTok, accurately depict U.S. attacks on three Iranian nuclear facilities (Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan) on the night of Sunday, June 22, 2025, and Iranian attacks against Israel. Step 2: Review the Key Evidence ProvidedThe fact-check provides the following evidence to assess the claim:- First Video (Claimed to Show U.S. Attack on Fordow): A reverse image search indicates this video likely shows a Ukrainian attack on a Russian ammunition depot in Toropets, Tver region, in September 2024. Reputable media outlets, including Reuters, NRK, TV2, The Guardian, and CNN, used the video in coverage of the Ukrainian attack, and its impact was notable enough to affect seismometers in Norway.- Second Video (Also Claimed to Show Fordow Attack): A reverse image search reveals this video was shared in December 2024, including by Belgian EU MP Marc Botenga on X, and likely depicts an Israeli attack on Tartus, Syria, following the fall of the Assad regime. Media outlets like the Daily Mail used it in their reporting on the Syrian attack.- Third Video (Claimed to Show Iranian Attacks on Israel): A reverse image search and Google search show this video is from the 103rd anniversary celebration of the Algerian football club Mouloudia Club, with the Arabic title on YouTube and related search results confirming this context. Step 3: Determine the VerdictVerdict: FalseJustification: The claim that these videos depict U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities or Iranian attacks on Israel is false. The evidence from reverse image searches and corroborating media reports clearly demonstrates that the videos are misattributed:- The first video is from a Ukrainian attack on a Russian ammunition depot in September 2024, not a U.S. attack on Iran.- The second video shows an Israeli attack on Tartus, Syria, in December 2024, not a U.S. attack on Fordow.- The third video is from a civilian celebration in Algeria, unrelated to any military action involving Iran or Israel.No evidence supports the claim that these videos show the alleged U.S. or Iranian attacks, and all three are conclusively linked to unrelated events.

One widely shared video, claimed to show the US attack on the Fordow facility, actually depicts a Ukrainian attack on a Russian ammunition depot in Toropets in September 2024. This was corroborated by various international and Norwegian media outlets. Another video, also claimed to show the Fordow attack, was found to have been shared in December 2024 and allegedly shows an Israeli attack on the Syrian coastal city of Tartus. A third video, purported to show Iranian attacks against Israel, is, in fact, footage from the celebration of the Algerian football club Mouloudia Club's 103rd anniversary.In all cases, the videos are from completely different times and events, confirming that they do not show US attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities.;Videos Claiming to Show US Attack on Iran's Nuclear Facilities Are Actually Footage of Unrelated Events: FALSE;A fact-check investigation found that several viral videos purporting to show the US attack on Iranian nuclear facilities on June 22 are actually footage from unrelated events, including a Ukrainian attack on a Russian ammunition depot and an Israeli attack on Syria, as well as a celebration of an Algerian football club's anniversary, debunking the claim of real-time coverage of the alleged US attacks.Meta AI response: A fact-check investigation found that several viral videos purporting to show the US attack on Iranian nuclear facilities on June 22 are actually footage from unrelated events, including a Ukrainian attack on a Russian ammunition depot and an Israeli attack on Syria, as well as a celebration of an Algerian football club's anniversary, debunking the claim of real-time coverage of the alleged US attacks.;The claim being assessed is that certain videos on social media show the US attack on Iranian nuclear facilities, specifically Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan, that allegedly occurred on June 22.The verdict is False.The reasoning or evidence that supports this decision is that the videos in question were found to be from completely different times and events.

The U.S. claims the strikes disabled Iran's nuclear program, while Iran denies significant damage.Evidence: Multiple videos circulating on social media, including one with 1.5 million views on TikTok, were analyzed using reverse image searches.

Another video, claimed to show the Fordow attack, was linked to an Israeli strike on Tartus, Syria, in December 2024, as used by the Daily Mail and posted by Belgian EU MP Marc Botenga on X. A third video, alleged to show Iranian attacks on Israel, was traced to a YouTube video of the Algerian football club Mouloudia Club’s 103rd anniversary celebration, confirmed via Google search.

The post, which has garnered over 1,200 likes, features a before and after photo of two sisters, one of whom is later shown as a deceased photo, with the remaining sister appearing significantly slimmer after using the supplement. However, this claim is false. The Facebook page is a sophisticated scam, a copy of the real Swedish Diabetes Association, which has only 900 followers compared to the genuine organization's 16,000. The Swedish Diabetes Association explicitly states it does not recommend, certify, or endorse any products, services, or medicines. The images of the women are likely AI-generated, and the success stories in the comments section use stolen photos from legitimate weight-loss journeys on platforms like Reddit. Experts, including Professor Fredrik Nyström of Linköping University and Professor Øke Lernmark of Lund University, confirm that no dietary supplements possess the claimed weight-loss effects and that such products are total fakes. The scam page, which originated in 2023 as The KING Photography, changed its name to Diabetesförbundet in April 2025 and is controlled from Hong Kong and China. Fraudsters are increasingly using advanced methods, including deepfakes and exploiting the names and images of public figures and organizations, to peddle these unproven remedies. The verdict is that the claims are false and a hoax, designed to defraud people into buying a useless and potentially harmful product.;Claim: A dietary supplement promoted by a Facebook page impersonating the Swedish Diabetes Association can lead to significant weight loss (e.g., 60 kg), as illustrated by a story of two sisters where one died due to obesity and the other lost substantial weight using the product. Key Evidence:  Impersonation: The Facebook page Diabetesförbundet is a fraudulent copy of the real Swedish Diabetes Association, with significantly fewer followers (900 vs. 16,000) and a history of name changes (from The KING Photography in 2023 to Diabetesförbundet in April 2025).  Official Disclaimer: The real Swedish Diabetes Association explicitly states that it neither recommends, certifies nor endorses products, services or medicines.  AI-Generated Imagery and Stolen Testimonials: The before and after photo of the sisters appears to be AI-generated and not published elsewhere. The success stories in the comments section use images stolen from genuine weight-loss narratives on platforms like Reddit, with fake profiles often linked to Asian countries.  Expert Consensus: Professors Fredrik Nyström (Linköping University) and Øke Lernmark (Lund University), both experts in related fields, unequivocally state that there are no dietary supplements that have these effects, it is a total fake. They emphasize that if such a product existed, pharmaceutical companies would have acquired it long ago.  Fraudulent Practices: The scammers are using advanced methods, including exploiting the names and images of public figures and organizations (such as various Swedish heart and obesity researchers, and Olivia Wigzell, Director General of the Swedish Public Health Agency, and even deepfakes) to promote these fake remedies.  Product Claims vs. Reality: The advertised product claims to have mechanics similar to popular new drugs that regulate blood sugar and affect hunger signals, but experts deny this dietary supplement possesses such properties. The promise of losing 60 kilos for 700 kronor is presented as too good to be true, which usually indicates a scam.  Health Warning: The chairman of the Swedish Diabetes Association advises consulting a doctor before taking any dietary supplements due to potential interactions with other medications. Verdict: False. Justification: The claim is demonstrably false on multiple fronts. The promoting entity is a fraudulent impersonation of a legitimate organization. The product's purported effects are rejected by scientific and medical experts, who confirm that no dietary supplement can deliver such significant weight loss. The visual evidence (before and after photos, user testimonials) is fabricated, using AI-generated images and stolen content.

Verdict and Justification: Verdict: Completely False The claim is entirely false based on the evidence. The Facebook page is a scam, not affiliated with the Swedish Diabetes Association, which explicitly denies endorsing any supplements. The story and images are fabricated, with AI-generated and stolen content used to deceive users. Expert testimony confirms the supplement’s claimed effects are scientifically implausible, as no dietary supplement can achieve such dramatic weight loss. The operation’s foreign control, use of deepfakes, and stolen identities further indicate fraudulent intent to mislead consumers for profit.
