Two schoolboys from Esbjerg had to sit scared in a tree for an hour and a half, hiding from a wolf that was circling below them. 2. JydskeVestkysten writes this in an article, where they also include the boys' own video recording of the animal.3. The incident has sparked a lot of debate on social media and among politicians. But according to experts, it wasn't a wolf at all that the boys encountered, but a big cat. ;Two boys aged 11 and 12 from Esbjerg had an experience on Thursday last week that made them really scared. While they were killing time climbing trees near their school, they suddenly saw a wolf approaching. The boys climbed four meters up the tree, where they had to wait for an hour and a half while the wolf circled below them.  This is reported by JydskeVestkysten , which also publishes a video of the roaming predator that the boys have recorded.  The article is being widely shared on social media, where it is overflowing with comments from people who are angry and outraged that the wolf is getting so close to children. The story has even reached Christiansborg Palace.  The Danish People's Party shares the story on X with the message of regaining security, and Liberal Party member of parliament Anni Matthiesen reports on Facebook about the boys' experience.  The same is done by the Social Democratic member of parliament Anders Kronborg on Facebook, where he writes that “HUMANS come before WOLF”.

They both assess that it is another animal that the boys have seen. It is certainly not a wolf seen in the film. Judging from the animal's size and movements, it is a cat. Probably a long-haired one, says Peter Sunde, professor and wolf expert at the Department of Ecoscience at Aarhus University. Kent Olsen, wolf expert and scientific director of senior researchers at the Natural History Museum, makes the same assessment. I have seen the recording and read the article. The recording shows that it is a cat and not a wolf, writes Kent Olsen in an email to TjekDet. In addition to the video that the experts have reviewed and which, according to them, does not show a wolf, JydskeVestkysten also includes a picture in the article that allegedly comes from the video.

In an email to TjekDet, Louise Lauritsen acknowledges that JydskeVestkysten should have made more linguistic reservations in the article and not concluded that it was a wolf. She does not answer directly whether they still believe that it is most likely that the boys saw a wolf. Instead, she writes: “We have conveyed the boys' experience of being scared by a wolf.

Expert opinions contradicting the initial claim and noting the animal’s size and movement did not match that of a wolf. 3. Verdict: False/Incorrect identification — While the boys genuinely felt threatened, the animal they saw was almost certainly not a wolf but another animal, such as a cat. The initial reporting overstated the certainty that it was a wolf, which was later corrected.;Here is the verdict of the fact-check based on your questions: 1. What is the claim being verified? Two boys in Esbjerg were trapped in a tree for over an hour by a wolf that was circling below them. 2. What is the final verdict? False 3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict?

The claim being verified is that two boys, aged 11 and 12, from Esbjerg, Denmark, were scared by a wolf that circled below them for an hour and a half while they were climbing trees near their school. This claim was initially reported by JydskeVestkysten, including a video recorded by the boys, and widely shared on social media, leading to public outrage and political discussion.  What is the main evidence used to support or refute this claim? The main evidence used to refute the claim comes from two leading Danish wolf experts, Peter Sunde (professor at Aarhus University) and Kent Olsen (scientific director at the Natural History Museum). Both experts reviewed the boys' video recording and independently assessed that the animal in the video is certainly not a wolf, but rather a cat, probably a long-haired one. Additionally, JydskeVestkysten clarified their article, stating that the image they published, which resembled a wolf, was a screenshot provided by the boys, not taken by the editorial staff, and that the school janitor's reported sighting was of a dog-like animal, not specifically a wolf.  What is the verdict given in the fact-check, and what are the key reasons behind this verdict? The verdict is that the claim is false regarding the animal being a wolf. The key reasons are the unanimous assessment of two expert wolf researchers who concluded that the animal in the boys' video is a cat, not a wolf.

FC_01;Bullet point summary;Story of wolf and scared boys reaches Christiansborg Palace. But it's a cat, experts say; 1. Two schoolboys from Esbjerg had to sit scared in a tree for an hour and a half, hiding from a wolf that was circling below them. 2. JydskeVestkysten writes this in an article, where they also include the boys' own video recording of the animal.3. The incident has sparked a lot of debate on social media and among politicians. But according to experts, it wasn't a wolf at all that the boys encountered, but a big cat. ;Two boys aged 11 and 12 from Esbjerg had an experience on Thursday last week that made them really scared. While they were killing time climbing trees near their school, they suddenly saw a wolf approaching. The boys climbed four meters up the tree, where they had to wait for an hour and a half while the wolf circled below them.  This is reported by JydskeVestkysten , which also publishes a video of the roaming predator that the boys have recorded.  The article is being widely shared on social media, where it is overflowing with comments from people who are angry and outraged that the wolf is getting so close to children. The story has even reached Christiansborg Palace.  The Danish People's Party shares the story on X with the message of regaining security, and Liberal Party member of parliament Anni Matthiesen reports on Facebook about the boys' experience.  The same is done by the Social Democratic member of parliament Anders Kronborg on Facebook, where he writes that “HUMANS come before WOLF”. Anders Kronborg is also a former city council member in Esbjerg Municipality, an open advocate for regulating wolves, and one of the two boys is his nephew. But it seems that it was not a wolf at all that the boys sought refuge from and filmed. JydskeVestkysten has also clarified their article and, among other things, changed the headline.  A Facebook user shares the video and points out that doubts have been raised about whether it is actually a wolf.Not a wolf, but a catTjekDet has been in contact with two of Denmark's leading wolf experts, who assess that it is not a wolf that appears in the boys' video recording of the incident. They both assess that it is another animal that the boys have seen. It is certainly not a wolf seen in the film. Judging from the animal's size and movements, it is a cat. Probably a long-haired one, says Peter Sunde, professor and wolf expert at the Department of Ecoscience at Aarhus University. Kent Olsen, wolf expert and scientific director of senior researchers at the Natural History Museum, makes the same assessment. I have seen the recording and read the article. The recording shows that it is a cat and not a wolf, writes Kent Olsen in an email to TjekDet. In addition to the video that the experts have reviewed and which, according to them, does not show a wolf, JydskeVestkysten also includes a picture in the article that allegedly comes from the video. The picture shows an animal that may well resemble a wolf. The caption states that the picture is a screenshot from the video recording that the boys took from the tree, and that the boys had no doubt that it was a wolf. Sign up for the CheckIt newsletter Louise Lauritsen, editor-in-chief and local editor of JydskeVestkysten in Esbjerg, informs TjekDet that the editorial staff did not take the screenshot from the boys' video themselves. The image was sent by the boys.  JydskeVestkysten has not wanted to release the boys' full-length recording to TjekDet, but says that they are in possession of it.  Following TjekDet's inquiry, JydskeVestkysten has provided a clarification in their article. “The headline of the article was changed on April 14th at 1:30 p.m. after several experts, whom JydskeVestkysten has spoken to, cast doubt on whether it was a wolf that scared the boys,” the media outlet now writes. They have also changed the headline from “Two boys sat up in a tree for an hour and a half while a wolf circled below them” to “Two boys sat up in a tree for an hour and a half out of fear of a wolf” . In an email to TjekDet, Louise Lauritsen acknowledges that JydskeVestkysten should have made more linguistic reservations in the article and not concluded that it was a wolf. She does not answer directly whether they still believe that it is most likely that the boys saw a wolf. Instead, she writes: “We have conveyed the boys' experience of being scared by a wolf. We perceive the children and their parents as credible sources and without alternative motive.” CheckedIs the wasp really more dangerous than the wolf? The original article also reports that the janitor at the nearby school also saw a wolf in the area the day after the two boys. JydskeVestkysten also clarifies this in the updated version. “The school janitor informs JydskeVestkysten that he has seen a dog-like animal in the area,” it now reads. They have also changed the caption to what is allegedly a screenshot from the two boys' video recording. They (the boys, ed.) had no doubt that this was a wolf, but experts do not agree, JydskeVestkysten has now added to the description. TjekDet has tried unsuccessfully to get in touch with the boys and their parents. CheckedViral appeal is good enough: A fallen sheep can die if it is not helped upWolves on Danish soilAlthough it is in all likelihood not a wolf that the boys have videotaped, wolves have been seen before to come close to people - even in cities.This happened earlier in April, when JydskeVestkysten reported a story about a wolf that had visited Tistrup and Ansager in Varde Municipality on a Saturday. Shortly before, Oksbøl, which is also located in Varde Municipality, had also had a wolf visit.If you like TjekDet's articles and want to make sure you don't miss the latest, follow us on Facebook by clicking here .

The Evidence: Wolf experts Peter Sunde (Aarhus University) and Kent Olsen (Natural History Museum) reviewed the boys’ video and confirmed the animal was not a wolf but most likely a long-haired cat. The media outlet JydskeVestkysten later updated its article, noting expert doubts and clarifying that the image and initial claim came from the boys and their family, not independent verification.  The Verdict: The claim is false. Expert analysis of the video shows the animal was a cat, not a wolf. JydskeVestkysten has since amended its article to reflect these findings and acknowledged it should have used more cautious language initially.;1. What is the claim being assessed? The claim is that two boys in Esbjerg, Denmark, were trapped in a tree for an hour and a half because a wolf was circling below them, which they captured on video. 2. What is the verdict (true/false/mixed/other relevant verdict category)? False. 3. What reasoning or evidence supports this decision? Two leading Danish wolf experts, Peter Sunde (Aarhus University) and Kent Olsen (Natural History Museum), reviewed the boys’ video and confirmed that the animal shown is not a wolf, but most likely a long-haired cat. The original article by JydskeVestkysten was updated after these assessments, changing both the headline and language to reflect uncertainty. The publication also clarified that it had relied on the boys' and parents' account and did not independently verify the species of the animal before publishing. No conclusive evidence supports that a wolf was present during the incident, and the visual evidence directly contradicts the claim.;Boys' 'Wolf' Encounter Identified by Experts as a Cat; The Claim: Two boys from Esbjerg claimed to have been scared by a wolf while climbing trees, forcing them to wait for an hour and a half as the wolf circled below, with a video supposedly confirming the presence of a wolf. This story was widely shared and discussed by politicians.  The Evidence: Two leading Danish wolf experts (Peter Sunde and Kent Olsen) independently reviewed the boys' video and assessed that the animal was certainly not a wolf but rather a cat, probably a long-haired one. JydskeVestkysten, the original publisher, clarified their article, changing the headline and acknowledging that the screenshot provided by the boys (which resembled a wolf) was not taken by their editorial staff. They also updated the report of a school janitor seeing a dog-like animal instead of a wolf.  The Verdict: False. The evidence strongly indicates that the animal seen and filmed by the boys was a cat, not a wolf. While the boys genuinely perceived a threat, expert analysis of the video refutes the presence of a wolf.;Here's the final verdict based on the fact-check: 1. What is the claim being assessed? The claim being assessed is that two boys in Esbjerg were threatened by a wolf that circled below them for an hour and a half while they were up a tree, and that they captured video evidence of this wolf. 2.

Two of Denmark's leading wolf experts, Professor Peter Sunde of Aarhus University and Kent Olsen of the Natural History Museum, independently reviewed the boys' video and both concluded that the animal was certainly not a wolf but rather a cat, probably a long-haired one.

Two of Denmark's leading wolf experts examined the boys' video and determined the animal in question was not a wolf but a domestic cat—likely long-haired—based on its size and movement. Following these findings, the newspaper revised its article and headline to reflect that the boys were afraid of what they believed to be a wolf.

JydskeVestkysten’s clarifications, including a revised headline and updated description of the janitor’s sighting as a “dog-like animal,” further support this conclusion, as does their admission of insufficient caution in the original reporting.
FC_01;Bullet point summary;Story of wolf and scared boys reaches Christiansborg Palace. But it's a cat, experts say; 1. Two schoolboys from Esbjerg had to sit scared in a tree for an hour and a half, hiding from a wolf that was circling below them. 2. JydskeVestkysten writes this in an article, where they also include the boys' own video recording of the animal.3. The incident has sparked a lot of debate on social media and among politicians. But according to experts, it wasn't a wolf at all that the boys encountered, but a big cat. ;Two boys aged 11 and 12 from Esbjerg had an experience on Thursday last week that made them really scared. While they were killing time climbing trees near their school, they suddenly saw a wolf approaching. The boys climbed four meters up the tree, where they had to wait for an hour and a half while the wolf circled below them.  This is reported by JydskeVestkysten , which also publishes a video of the roaming predator that the boys have recorded.  The article is being widely shared on social media, where it is overflowing with comments from people who are angry and outraged that the wolf is getting so close to children. The story has even reached Christiansborg Palace.  The Danish People's Party shares the story on X with the message of regaining security, and Liberal Party member of parliament Anni Matthiesen reports on Facebook about the boys' experience.  The same is done by the Social Democratic member of parliament Anders Kronborg on Facebook, where he writes that “HUMANS come before WOLF”. Anders Kronborg is also a former city council member in Esbjerg Municipality, an open advocate for regulating wolves, and one of the two boys is his nephew. But it seems that it was not a wolf at all that the boys sought refuge from and filmed. JydskeVestkysten has also clarified their article and, among other things, changed the headline.  A Facebook user shares the video and points out that doubts have been raised about whether it is actually a wolf.Not a wolf, but a catTjekDet has been in contact with two of Denmark's leading wolf experts, who assess that it is not a wolf that appears in the boys' video recording of the incident. They both assess that it is another animal that the boys have seen. It is certainly not a wolf seen in the film. Judging from the animal's size and movements, it is a cat. Probably a long-haired one, says Peter Sunde, professor and wolf expert at the Department of Ecoscience at Aarhus University. Kent Olsen, wolf expert and scientific director of senior researchers at the Natural History Museum, makes the same assessment. I have seen the recording and read the article. The recording shows that it is a cat and not a wolf, writes Kent Olsen in an email to TjekDet. In addition to the video that the experts have reviewed and which, according to them, does not show a wolf, JydskeVestkysten also includes a picture in the article that allegedly comes from the video. The picture shows an animal that may well resemble a wolf. The caption states that the picture is a screenshot from the video recording that the boys took from the tree, and that the boys had no doubt that it was a wolf. Sign up for the CheckIt newsletter Louise Lauritsen, editor-in-chief and local editor of JydskeVestkysten in Esbjerg, informs TjekDet that the editorial staff did not take the screenshot from the boys' video themselves. The image was sent by the boys.  JydskeVestkysten has not wanted to release the boys' full-length recording to TjekDet, but says that they are in possession of it.  Following TjekDet's inquiry, JydskeVestkysten has provided a clarification in their article. “The headline of the article was changed on April 14th at 1:30 p.m. after several experts, whom JydskeVestkysten has spoken to, cast doubt on whether it was a wolf that scared the boys,” the media outlet now writes. They have also changed the headline from “Two boys sat up in a tree for an hour and a half while a wolf circled below them” to “Two boys sat up in a tree for an hour and a half out of fear of a wolf” . In an email to TjekDet, Louise Lauritsen acknowledges that JydskeVestkysten should have made more linguistic reservations in the article and not concluded that it was a wolf. She does not answer directly whether they still believe that it is most likely that the boys saw a wolf. Instead, she writes: “We have conveyed the boys' experience of being scared by a wolf. We perceive the children and their parents as credible sources and without alternative motive.” CheckedIs the wasp really more dangerous than the wolf? The original article also reports that the janitor at the nearby school also saw a wolf in the area the day after the two boys. JydskeVestkysten also clarifies this in the updated version. “The school janitor informs JydskeVestkysten that he has seen a dog-like animal in the area,” it now reads. They have also changed the caption to what is allegedly a screenshot from the two boys' video recording. They (the boys, ed.) had no doubt that this was a wolf, but experts do not agree, JydskeVestkysten has now added to the description. TjekDet has tried unsuccessfully to get in touch with the boys and their parents. CheckedViral appeal is good enough: A fallen sheep can die if it is not helped upWolves on Danish soilAlthough it is in all likelihood not a wolf that the boys have videotaped, wolves have been seen before to come close to people - even in cities.This happened earlier in April, when JydskeVestkysten reported a story about a wolf that had visited Tistrup and Ansager in Varde Municipality on a Saturday. Shortly before, Oksbøl, which is also located in Varde Municipality, had also had a wolf visit.If you like TjekDet's articles and want to make sure you don't miss the latest, follow us on Facebook by clicking here .

Evidence:  The boys and their parents reported the incident and provided a video and a screenshot of the animal.  The local newspaper JydskeVestkysten initially published the story with a headline stating the boys sat in a tree while a wolf circled below.  Two leading Danish wolf experts reviewed the video and concluded that the animal is not a wolf but most likely a long-haired cat based on size and movement.  JydskeVestkysten clarified their article by changing the headline to reflect that the boys feared a wolf rather than confirming a wolf’s presence.  Additional eyewitness reports, such as a school janitor’s sighting, were revised to state the animal resembled a dog rather than a wolf.  The media outlet acknowledged they should have been more cautious in labeling the animal a wolf and emphasized the boys’ experience of fear without confirming the animal’s identity. Verdict: The claim that the boys were approached and scared by a wolf is false. Although the boys genuinely believed they saw a wolf, expert analysis of the video strongly indicates the animal was a cat. The original report was corrected to avoid misidentifying the animal, and there is no verified evidence confirming the presence of a wolf in this specific incident.;1. Claim: Two boys from Esbjerg were frightened by and filmed a wolf circling below them while they were up in a tree. 2. Final verdict: False. 3. Explanation: Experts reviewed the video footage and determined the animal in question is not a wolf but most likely a long-haired cat, based on its size and movements. The newspaper that reported the story revised their headline and clarified the situation after expert input cast doubt on the wolf identification. No verified evidence confirms that a wolf was present during the incident, so the claim that the boys were scared by a wolf is false.;Esbjerg Boys' 'Wolf Encounter' Was Actually a Cat, Experts Confirm;A widely shared story claimed that two boys, aged 11 and 12, were terrorized by a wolf for 90 minutes while climbing trees near their school in Esbjerg, Denmark, with a video supposedly showing the wolf. The claim gained significant traction, especially on social media, sparking outrage and even reaching politicians. However, a fact-check by TjekDet, contacting leading Danish wolf experts, disputed this claim. Both Peter Sunde, professor and wolf expert at Aarhus University, and Kent Olsen, wolf expert and scientific director at the Natural History Museum, independently assessed the video and concluded it was not a wolf but a cat, likely a long-haired one, based on the animal's size and movements. JydskeVestkysten, the original publisher of the story, has since clarified their article, changing the headline to reflect that the boys were fearful of a wolf rather than explicitly stating it was a wolf. They also updated their description of a school janitor's sighting, changing wolf to dog-like animal. While JydskeVestkysten maintained that the boys and their parents were credible sources regarding their experience of fear, they admitted to TjekDet that they should have used more linguistic reservations in their initial reporting. The image initially presented as a screenshot from the video and resembling a wolf was provided by the boys, not taken by the editorial staff, and its caption has now been updated to reflect expert doubt. Verdict: The claim that the boys were circled by a wolf is false. Expert analysis of the video indicates the animal was a cat, not a wolf.;Claim: Two boys from Esbjerg were circled by a wolf for an hour and a half while climbing trees near their school, and they filmed the wolf. Verdict: False. Explanation: Two leading Danish wolf experts independently reviewed the boys' video recording of the incident and unequivocally stated that the animal shown is a cat, likely a long-haired one, not a wolf. The original news outlet that published the story has since corrected its article and headline to reflect the experts' doubt and acknowledge that the image they published, which resembled a wolf, was provided by the boys and not a screenshot taken by their editorial team. While the boys genuinely experienced fear, the animal they feared was misidentified.;Fact-Check: Video Shows Cat, Not Wolf, Threatening Danish Boys;Claim: Two boys in Esbjerg, Denmark, were scared by a wolf that approached them while they were climbing trees, and they recorded a video of it.

Based on the expert opinions, the video recording actually shows a cat, likely a long-haired one, and not a wolf. The boys and their parents reportedly believed it was a wolf, but the evidence suggests otherwise.;Claim: Two boys in Esbjerg, Denmark, were threatened by a wolf that approached them while they were climbing trees, which they recorded on video. Verdict: False. Explanation: The claim is deemed false based on expert analysis. Two leading wolf experts, Peter Sunde and Kent Olsen, reviewed the video recording and concluded that the animal in the video is not a wolf, but rather a cat, likely a long-haired one. This expert opinion contradicts the boys' and the original news article's claim that the animal was a wolf. Although the boys reportedly believed it was a wolf and were scared, the evidence from the experts suggests that the animal in question was actually a cat. Therefore, the claim about the wolf is false.;No Wolf in Esbjerg: Boys Mistook Cat for Predator, Experts Confirm;Claim: Two boys in Esbjerg, Denmark, were scared by a wolf that circled below them while they were in a tree for an hour and a half, as reported by JydskeVestkysten and supported by a video and a screenshot from the boys. Evidence: - Two leading wolf experts, Peter Sunde from Aarhus University and Kent Olsen from the Natural History Museum, reviewed the boys' video and concluded it showed a cat, likely a long-haired one, not a wolf, based on the animal’s size and movements. - JydskeVestkysten clarified their article after experts raised doubts, changing the headline to reflect uncertainty about the animal being a wolf and updating the caption of the screenshot to note expert disagreement. - The screenshot allegedly from the boys’ video, which resembled a wolf, was provided by the boys, not taken directly by the newspaper. - The school janitor’s claim of seeing a wolf was revised to describe a “dog-like animal.” - The newspaper acknowledged they should have used more cautious language and not concluded it was a wolf, but they maintained the boys and their parents were credible sources. Verdict: False. The claim that the boys were scared by a wolf is not supported by the evidence. Expert analysis of the video indicates the animal was a cat, not a wolf, and the newspaper’s clarifications and revised statements further undermine the original claim. While the boys may have genuinely believed they saw a wolf, the evidence points to a misidentification.;Claim: Two boys in Esbjerg, Denmark, were scared by a wolf that circled below them while they were in a tree for an hour and a half, as reported by JydskeVestkysten, supported by a video and a screenshot from the boys.

FC_02;Bullet point summary;The Trump circle again makes the false claim that Greenlanders want to be part of the United States;American Trump supporters continue to claim that Greenlanders want to be part of the United States.  But there is nothing to indicate that this is the wish of the Greenlanders.   According to a researcher, the Trump administration is trying to convince a skeptical American public that annexing Greenland is a good idea.  But we do not know the Greenlanders' position on negotiating a cooperation agreement with the United States, and such an option is still on the table.;This is the fact-check :While US Vice President JD Vance was visiting American soldiers at Pituffik Space Base in northwestern Greenland at the end of March, Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna was on live air on Fox News .Here she said that not only is Greenland a strategically good place for the United States, but the Greenlandic population is a big supporter of potentially becoming an American territory.It is far from the first time that President Donald Trump himself or his circle of supporters have said that Greenlanders would like to be part of the United States. Back in January, the president claimed, in connection with his desire to take over Greenland, for example , that “the Greenlandic people will be with us.”So is there really anything to talk about? Do Greenlanders want to belong to the United States, since the Trump circle keeps repeating it?Live on Fox News, Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna reiterates that Greenlanders want to be American territory.Wants American supportNo, there is nothing to suggest that at all, says Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen , an associate professor at the Danish Defence Academy's Centre for Arctic Security Studies, referring to a poll by the research institute Verian .The same poll was also used back in January to refute Donald Trump's claim that Greenlanders want to be part of the United States. Verian's poll found that only six percent of Greenlanders want to leave the Commonwealth and instead become part of the United States. A full 85 percent answered no to the same question. Yet Trump supporters seem to be sticking to the claim. The reason for this must be found within American borders, believes Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen.In the US, the idea of taking over Greenland is also unpopular. The Trump administration is trying to influence public opinion so that it will appear as a good idea. It requires a narrative that the US can really get a lot out of it, and that the Greenlanders are on board with it, he says.A new poll from the Pew Research Center shows that there is low support among Americans for Trump's plan to take over Greenland. 54 percent do not believe that the United States should take over Greenland, while 23 percent are in favor.Fraudulent measurementHowever, there is one opinion poll that supports the Trump circle's interpretation of the Greenlanders' position. Back in January, the organization Patriot Polling presented startling figures shortly after Donald Trump Jr.'s visit to Nuuk. A full 57 percent of Greenlanders reportedly supported the idea of Greenland joining the United States.The Trump-loyal podcaster Charlie Kirk, who was with Donald Trump Jr. in Nuuk, circulated the poll and said that Greenlanders want to be part of the United States . However, experts have since denied that the numbers say anything precise about Greenlanders' attitudes.Either the numbers have been tampered with, or they are freely invented , says Ulrik Pram Gad, a senior researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies (DIIS).“I'm not sure they've even spoken to anyone in Greenland. According to the methodology description, Patriot Polling calls landlines. But there are no landlines in Greenland at all,” he says.  The Verian poll is not perfect either, says Ulrik Pram Gad, because it is difficult to conduct polls in Greenland. Verian's Greenlandic respondents were not selected representatively, just as in the aforementioned question they are asked two things at once. That is, both whether they want to leave the Commonwealth and whether they want to join the USA.“It is methodologically fragile, but the answers are so overwhelming that you can take it as a strong indication that Greenlanders do not want to be part of the USA,” says Ulrik Pram Gad.The people of Greenland want to join America! https:;Vanilla;Claim That Greenlanders Want to Join the U.S. Is False, Credible Polls Show Overwhelming Opposition;False Claims of Support: Despite repeated claims by Donald Trump and his allies, including Anna Paulina Luna and Charlie Kirk, there is no credible evidence that Greenlanders want to become part of the United States. A reliable Verian poll shows only 6% support for joining the U.S., while 85% oppose it.  Questionable Polling by Trump Allies: A conflicting poll from Patriot Polling cited by Trump supporters claimed 57% support among Greenlanders but has been discredited due to methodological flaws—such as allegedly calling non-existent landlines in Greenland.  Greenland’s Stance Remains Reserved: Recent Greenlandic elections and the coalition agreement suggest more caution and skepticism toward U.S. relations, especially after Trump’s annexation rhetoric. While some Greenlandic parties are open to cooperation, full integration with the U.S. is broadly rejected.;Verdict: False The claim that Greenlanders want to become an American territory is not supported by credible evidence. Reliable polling shows overwhelming opposition (85%) to joining the United States, and the only poll suggesting support has been discredited due to serious methodological issues. Additionally, Greenlandic politicians and recent election results indicate a reserved stance toward deeper ties with the U.S., not support for annexation.;Fact Check: Claim That Greenlanders Big Supporters of Becoming U.S. Territory is False;Overwhelming majority of Greenlanders do NOT want to become a U.S. territory. A credible poll by research institute Verian indicates that only 6% of Greenlanders want to join the United States, while 85% are opposed. This directly refutes repeated claims by President Donald Trump and his supporters.  A poll supporting the pro-US claim is highly suspect. The organization Patriot Polling released figures suggesting 57% of Greenlanders supported joining the U.S. However, experts like Ulrik Pram Gad dismiss these numbers as potentially tampered with or invented, noting that Patriot Polling's methodology (calling landlines) is inapplicable in Greenland, where landlines don't exist.  Greenlandic politicians and public opinion are increasingly reserved about U.S. overtures. Despite some U.S. interest in closer cooperation, Greenlandic political leaders have strongly distanced themselves from Trump's annexation statements. While a closer partnership could be explored, recent election results, where a more Trump-skeptical party won, signal that the Greenlandic population is not as receptive to the idea of becoming part of the U.S. as some American figures suggest.;The verdict for the claim the Greenlandic population is a big supporter of potentially becoming an American territory is False. While a single, highly questionable poll from Patriot Polling suggested otherwise, a more reputable and representative poll by Verian clearly showed that only 6% of Greenlanders want to join the United States, with 85% opposing the idea. Furthermore, Greenlandic politicians have consistently rejected the notion of becoming an American territory, and recent election results indicate a public sentiment that is not receptive to such a move. The claims by Donald Trump and his supporters appear to be based on a flawed or fabricated narrative rather than genuine public opinion in Greenland.;Greenland Didn't Vote to Join US, Claims Misleading;Greenlanders' Views on Becoming Part of the US: A poll by Verian found that only 6% of Greenlanders want to leave the Commonwealth and join the United States, while 85% answered no. This contradicts claims by Trump supporters that Greenlanders want to be part of the US. Interpreting Election Results: The recent Greenlandic parliamentary elections saw the Trump-skeptical party Demokraatit win, while the Naleraq party, which helped arrange Donald Trump Jr.'s visit to Nuuk, made some progress. Experts believe this indicates Greenlanders are not tempted by the idea of becoming part of the US. Alternative Cooperation Models: While there's no indication Greenlanders want to join the US, some experts suggest a closer partnership between Greenland and the US could take forms like a free association agreement. However, no polls have been conducted on such models, and politicians have become more reserved towards agreements with the US after Trump's statements on annexing Greenland.;The verdict for the fact-check is Misleading. According to the fact-check, Greenland did not vote to join the United States, and the claim misinterprets the results of an opinion poll. In fact, a Verian poll found that 85% of Greenlanders do not want to be part of the US, while only 6% want to leave the Commonwealth and join the United States. This clearly indicates that the claim is not accurate ¹ ².;False: Greenlanders Do Not Want to Join the U.S., Despite Trump Supporters' Claims;Greenlanders' Views on U.S. Territory Status: Polls, particularly from Verian, show minimal support (6%) among Greenlanders for becoming a U.S. territory, with 85% opposing it, contradicting claims by Trump supporters like Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna and Charlie Kirk. - Questionable Patriot Polling Data: A poll by Patriot Polling claiming 57% Greenlandic support for U.S. integration is dismissed by experts as unreliable, potentially fabricated, due to methodological flaws like assuming landline usage in Greenland, where none exist. - Political Context and Misinterpretations: Despite Trump circle's narratives, Greenland's recent elections favored Commonwealth-friendly parties like Demokraatit, indicating resistance to U.S. annexation, though interest in potential cooperation agreements persists, albeit with increasing caution.;The verdict for the fact-check is False. The claim that Greenlanders want to become part of the United States, as stated by Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna and other Trump supporters, is not supported by reliable evidence. The Verian poll indicates only 6% of Greenlanders support joining the U.S., with 85% opposing it, and the Patriot Polling data cited by Trump supporters is considered unreliable or potentially fabricated by experts.

Evidence Used:  A poll by Verian found that only 6% of Greenlanders support becoming part of the United States, while 85% oppose it.  A contradictory poll by Patriot Polling claimed 57% support but was widely discredited due to methodological flaws—such as using landlines, which do not exist in Greenland.  Greenland’s recent election results and statements from politicians indicate skepticism and rejection of U.S. annexation.  Verdict: False — There is no credible evidence that Greenlanders want to become a U.S. territory. The dominant sentiment in Greenland is against such a move, and claims to the contrary are unsupported or based on dubious data.;Here is the verdict of the fact-check based on your questions: 1. What is the claim being verified? That a majority of Greenlanders want Greenland to become an American territory, as claimed by Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna and other Trump supporters. 2. What is the final verdict? False 3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict?  A credible Verian poll shows that only 6% of Greenlanders support joining the U.S., while 85% oppose it.  A Patriot Polling survey claiming 57% support is discredited by experts due to questionable methodology (e.g., calling landlines, which don’t exist in Greenland).  Greenland’s recent elections and statements from all major party leaders indicate continued opposition to U.S. annexation.  Experts agree there is no reliable evidence to support the claim that Greenlanders want to become a U.S. territory.;Claim That Greenlanders Want to Be US Territory Debunked by Polls and Election Results;What is the claim being verified in this fact-check? The claim being verified is that the Greenlandic population is a big supporter of potentially becoming an American territory and that Greenlanders want to be part of the United States, as repeatedly stated by US Vice President JD Vance, Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, and other figures in Donald Trump's circle. What is the main evidence used to support or refute this claim? The main evidence refuting the claim is a poll by the research institute Verian, which found that only six percent of Greenlanders want to leave the Commonwealth and become part of the United States, while a full 85 percent answered no to the same question. The fact-check also dismisses a Patriot Polling survey that supported the Trump circle's claim (57% in favor) by highlighting methodological flaws, such as claiming to call landlines which do not exist in Greenland. Additionally, the recent Greenlandic parliamentary election results, where the Demokraatit party (considered more Trump-skeptical) won, further refute the idea of growing pro-US sentiment for annexation. What is the verdict given in the fact-check, and what are the key reasons behind this verdict? The verdict is False. The key reasons are the overwhelming evidence from the Verian poll indicating strong opposition (85%) among Greenlanders to becoming a US territory, the discredited methodology of the Patriot Polling survey, and the outcomes of the recent Greenlandic parliamentary elections which saw a party that is more reserved towards the US win. Greenlandic political leaders have also strongly distanced themselves from Trump's statements about annexing Greenland. While Greenlanders generally desire more independence from Denmark, this does not translate into a desire to become part of the United States.;Here's the verdict of the fact-check: 1. What is the claim being verified? The claim being verified is that the Greenlandic population largely supports becoming an American territory. This claim has been repeatedly made by figures in Donald Trump's circle, including Vice President JD Vance and Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna. 2. What is the final verdict (True/False/Mixed)? False. 3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict? The verdict is strongly supported by a poll from the research institute Verian, which found that a substantial majority (85%) of Greenlanders do not wish to leave the Commonwealth and join the United States. Only six percent expressed a desire to become part of the U.S. Furthermore, a poll cited by Trump supporters (Patriot Polling) which claimed 57% support was deemed unreliable and likely fraudulent by experts due to severe methodological flaws, such as claiming to conduct interviews via landlines which do not exist in Greenland. Additionally, recent Greenlandic parliamentary elections saw a party considered more Trump-skeptical (Demokraatit) win, and Greenlandic political leaders have consistently and strongly rejected the idea of annexation by the United States. While Greenlanders generally desire greater independence from Denmark, this aspiration is separate from, and does not equate to, a desire to become a U.S. territory.;Greenlanders Overwhelmingly Reject Trump's Claim: 85% Oppose Joining the US;Claim being verified: The claim being fact-checked is that Greenlanders want to become part of the United States, a narrative pushed by Donald Trump and his supporters. Main evidence: The main evidence used to refute this claim is a poll conducted by Verian, which found that 85% of Greenlanders do not want to leave the Danish Realm and become part of the United States, while only 6% support the idea. Experts also point out that a contradictory poll by Patriot Polling, which suggested 57% of Greenlanders support joining the US, is likely flawed due to methodological issues, such as attempting to conduct surveys via landlines, which are non-existent in Greenland. Verdict: The verdict of the fact-check is False. The key reasons behind this verdict are the overwhelming majority of Greenlanders rejecting the idea of becoming part of the US in the Verian poll, and the lack of credibility in the Patriot Polling survey. Additionally, Greenlandic party leaders have distanced themselves from Trump's annexation statements, and experts interpret recent election results as a signal that Greenlanders are not interested in becoming part of the US ¹.;Claim being verified: The claim being fact-checked is that Greenlanders want to become part of the United States, a narrative pushed by Donald Trump and his supporters. Final verdict: False Evidence supporting the verdict: A poll conducted by Verian found that 85% of Greenlanders do not want to leave the Danish Realm and become part of the United States, while only 6% support the idea. This overwhelming majority rejecting the idea of becoming part of the US is a key reason for the verdict. Additionally, experts have questioned the credibility of a contradictory poll by Patriot Polling that suggested 57% of Greenlanders support joining the US, citing methodological issues such as attempting to conduct surveys via non-existent landlines in Greenland. Greenlandic party leaders have also distanced themselves from Trump's annexation statements, further supporting the verdict ¹.;False: Greenlanders Do Not Want to Join the U.S., Despite Trump Circle's Claims Supporting;Claim Being Verified: Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna and others in Donald Trump's circle, including Trump himself, have claimed that Greenlanders want to become part of the United States as an American territory. - Main Evidence: A Verian poll shows only 6% of Greenlanders support joining the U.S., while 85% oppose it. A Patriot Polling survey claiming 57% support is discredited due to methodological flaws, such as claiming to use landline calls in Greenland, where landlines are nonexistent. Additionally, Greenland’s recent parliamentary election results, favoring the Trump-skeptical Demokraatit party, suggest limited support for U.S. alignment. - Verdict: False. The claim is unsupported by reliable evidence, as the Verian poll overwhelmingly indicates Greenlanders do not want to join the U.S. The Patriot Polling survey is likely fabricated or flawed, and political developments in Greenland further contradict the claim.;1. Claim Being Verified: Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna and others in Donald Trump's circle, including Trump himself, claim that Greenlanders want to become part of the United States as an American territory. 2. Final Verdict: False. 3. Evidence/Reasoning Supporting the Verdict: - A Verian poll indicates only 6% of Greenlanders support joining the U.S., while 85% oppose it, directly contradicting the claim. - A Patriot Polling survey claiming 57% support is discredited due to methodological issues, including the false claim of using landline calls in Greenland, where landlines do not exist. - Greenland’s recent parliamentary election results show strong support for the Trump-skeptical Demokraatit party, suggesting limited interest in U.S. alignment. - Experts, including Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen and Ulrik Pram Gad, confirm there is no evidence supporting the claim, and Greenlandic leaders have distanced themselves from Trump’s annexation statements.

Evidence Examined: This claim is contradicted by a Verian poll, which found that only 6% of Greenlanders supported joining the U.S., while 85% opposed it. A conflicting poll from Patriot Polling, which claimed 57% support, has been widely discredited due to serious methodological flaws—such as claiming to call Greenlandic landlines, which do not exist.  Final Verdict: The fact-check refutes the claim. Experts confirm there is no credible evidence that Greenlanders want to become part of the United States. While U.S.-Greenland cooperation may still be of interest, Greenlandic politicians and the population remain strongly opposed to annexation, and recent political developments suggest a more reserved stance toward the U.S.;Verdict: False 1. Claim Being Evaluated: Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna and other Trump allies claim that the Greenlandic population broadly supports the idea of Greenland becoming an American territory. 2. Key Evidence:  A credible poll by the research institute Verian found that only 6% of Greenlanders supported joining the United States, while 85% opposed the idea.  A conflicting poll by Patriot Polling, cited by Trump supporters, claimed 57% support but has been discredited due to methodological flaws (e.g., reliance on non-existent landlines in Greenland), and experts question whether any real polling occurred.  Experts such as Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen and Ulrik Pram Gad emphasize that there is no legitimate evidence supporting the claim, and recent Greenlandic election results and political developments indicate skepticism or outright rejection of U.S. annexation. 3. Conclusion: The claim that Greenlanders want to become part of the United States is false, as it is not supported by reliable data or local political sentiment. The claim relies on misleading or fabricated polling and misinterpretations of Greenlandic political developments.;Polls Show Greenlanders Overwhelmingly Reject Becoming U.S. Territory;Claim Evaluated: The central claim being evaluated is whether the Greenlandic population largely supports the idea of becoming an American territory, as repeatedly asserted by Donald Trump and his circle of supporters.  Evidence Provided: The fact-check primarily relies on a poll by the research institute Verian, which found that only six percent of Greenlanders want to become part of the United States, while a significant 85 percent oppose it. It also addresses a contradictory poll from Patriot Polling, which claimed 57 percent support for joining the US, but this poll is discredited by experts due to questionable methodology (e.g., calling non-existent landlines in Greenland) and potential tampering. The article also notes that recent Greenlandic parliamentary election results and statements from Greenlandic party leaders further indicate a strong disinterest in annexation by the US.  Verdict: The fact-check concludes that there is nothing to suggest that Greenlanders want to be part of the United States. The overwhelming evidence from reputable polling and statements from Greenlandic political figures strongly refutes the claims made by the Trump circle, suggesting these claims are an attempt to influence American public opinion rather than reflect the actual desires of the Greenlandic people.;Verdict: False Claim: Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna and others in Donald Trump's circle have repeatedly claimed that the Greenlandic population is a big supporter of potentially becoming an American territory. Key Evidence:  Verian Poll: A robust poll by the research institute Verian explicitly asked Greenlanders if they wanted to leave the Commonwealth and become part of the United States. Only six percent answered yes, while a substantial 85 percent answered no. While the poll's methodology is acknowledged as methodologically fragile due to challenges in conducting polls in Greenland (e.g., respondents being asked two things at once), the overwhelming nature of the no responses provides a strong indication of public sentiment.  Discredited Patriot Polling: A contradictory poll from Patriot Polling, showing 57 percent support for joining the US, is dismissed as unreliable by experts. Reasons cited include questionable methodology (e.g., attempting to call non-existent landlines in Greenland) and the possibility of tampered or invented numbers.  Greenlandic Political Stance: Immediately after recent parliamentary elections, all Greenlandic party leaders strongly distanced themselves from Donald Trump's statements about annexing and controlling Greenland. The Demokraatit party, which won the election and is described as Trump-skeptical, further indicates a lack of desire for US annexation.  Expert Consensus: Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen of the Danish Defence Academy and Ulrik Pram Gad of the Danish Institute for International Studies both state that there is nothing to suggest that at all that Greenlanders want to become an American territory. Justification: The overwhelming evidence from a reputable poll and the consistent rejection of the idea by Greenlandic political leaders directly contradicts the claim. The single poll supporting the claim has been widely discredited due to severe methodological flaws. Therefore, the assertion that Greenlanders want to become an American territory is demonstrably false.;Greenlanders Don't Want to Be Part of the US: Fact-Check Reveals Overwhelming Opposition;Claim: The claim being evaluated is that Greenlanders want to become part of the United States, a statement repeatedly made by Donald Trump and his supporters, including Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna and podcaster Charlie Kirk. Evidence: The main evidence provided to assess the truthfulness of this claim includes polls conducted by Verian and Patriot Polling. Verian's poll found that 85% of Greenlanders do not want to leave the Danish Realm and become part of the United States, while 6% want to do so. In contrast, Patriot Polling reported that 57% of Greenlanders support joining the US. However, experts have questioned the validity of Patriot Polling's numbers, citing methodological issues, such as the fact that there are no landlines in Greenland, which was the supposed method of data collection. Verdict: The fact-check concludes that there is no evidence to support the claim that Greenlanders want to become part of the United States. The Verian poll's results, despite some methodological limitations, are considered a strong indication that Greenlanders do not want to join the US. Additionally, Greenlandic party leaders have distanced themselves from Trump's statements about annexing Greenland, and experts believe that the Trump administration is trying to influence public opinion in the US to make the idea of taking over Greenland seem appealing ¹.;The claim being evaluated is that Greenlanders want to become part of the United States. This assertion has been repeatedly made by Donald Trump and his supporters. Key evidence provided to assess the claim includes polls conducted by Verian and Patriot Polling. The Verian poll found that a significant majority, 85%, of Greenlanders do not want to leave the Danish Realm and become part of the United States, while only 6% want to do so. On the other hand, Patriot Polling reported that 57% of Greenlanders support joining the US. However, experts have questioned the validity of Patriot Polling's numbers due to methodological issues, such as the fact that there are no landlines in Greenland, which was the supposed method of data collection. Based on the evidence, the verdict is that the claim is FALSE. The Verian poll's results are considered a strong indication that Greenlanders do not want to join the US, and experts believe that the Trump administration is trying to influence public opinion in the US to make the idea of taking over Greenland seem appealing. Additionally, Greenlandic party leaders have distanced themselves from Trump's statements about annexing Greenland. The Patriot Polling's findings are not considered reliable due to methodological concerns, and there's no evidence of an official democratic process or vote by Greenlanders to join the US ¹ ².;False: Greenlanders Do Not Want to Join the US, Despite Claims from Trump Supporters;Claim: Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna and others in Donald Trump's circle have repeatedly claimed that Greenlanders want to become part of the United States, with Luna stating on Fox News that the Greenlandic population strongly supports becoming an American territory. - Evidence: A Verian poll shows only 6% of Greenlanders want to join the US, while 85% oppose it. A Patriot Polling survey, cited by Trump supporters, claimed 57% support, but experts like Ulrik Pram Gad question its validity, noting Greenland lacks landlines, which the poll supposedly used. The Greenlandic election results also favor Trump-skeptical parties, contradicting claims of pro-US sentiment. - Verdict: The claim is false. There is no evidence supporting the idea that Greenlanders want to be part of the US. The Verian poll, despite methodological flaws, strongly indicates opposition, and the discredited Patriot Polling survey lacks credibility. Greenlandic political developments further show reluctance toward US annexation.;Verdict: The claim that Greenlanders want to become part of the United States, as stated by Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna and others in Donald Trump's circle, is false. Claim: The core assertion is that the Greenlandic population strongly supports becoming an American territory, as reiterated by Luna on Fox News and echoed by Trump and his supporters, including claims that Greenlanders are receptive to joining the US. Key Evidence: - A Verian poll indicates only 6% of Greenlanders support joining the US, while 85% oppose leaving the Danish Commonwealth to become part of the US. Despite methodological weaknesses, the overwhelming response suggests strong opposition. - A Patriot Polling survey, cited by Trump supporters like Charlie Kirk, claimed 57% of Greenlanders support joining the US. However, experts like Ulrik Pram Gad discredit this poll, noting that its methodology (calling landlines) is implausible since Greenland lacks landlines, suggesting the results are either tampered with or fabricated. - Greenland's recent parliamentary elections saw a Trump-skeptical party, Demokraatit, win, and even the coalition agreement reflects growing reservation toward US cooperation, contradicting claims of pro-US sentiment. All Greenlandic party leaders have distanced themselves from Trump’s annexation statements. Justification: The evidence overwhelmingly contradicts the claim. The Verian poll, while not methodologically perfect, provides a strong indication of Greenlanders’ opposition to US annexation. The Patriot Polling survey lacks credibility due to its flawed methodology, and political developments in Greenland, including election results and party stances, further refute the idea of widespread support for becoming a US territory. No reliable data or events support the claim, making it false.

The Evidence: Independent polls, particularly one from Verian, found only 6% of Greenlanders support joining the U.S., while 85% opposed the idea. Experts discredited the pro-Trump “Patriot Polling” as methodologically flawed or fabricated, noting that it allegedly relied on landline calls, despite Greenland lacking landline infrastructure. Greenlandic elections and statements from local politicians further contradict claims of pro-U.S. sentiment.  The Verdict: False. There is no credible evidence that Greenlanders want to become part of the United States. Reputable data and expert analysis overwhelmingly indicate that the population does not support U.S. annexation, and political signals from Greenland show increased caution, not alignment, with U.S. territorial ambitions.;1. What is the claim being assessed? The claim assessed is that a significant portion of the Greenlandic population supports becoming an American territory, as repeatedly stated by U.S. political figures such as Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, Donald Trump, and pro-Trump commentators. 2. What is the verdict? False. 3. What reasoning or evidence supports this decision? Credible polls, notably by the Verian research institute, show that only about 6% of Greenlanders support leaving the Danish Commonwealth to join the United States, while 85% oppose it. The poll cited by Trump supporters claiming 57% support was discredited due to flawed or possibly fabricated methodology, including reliance on nonexistent Greenlandic landlines. Greenlandic election results and statements from local political leaders further contradict the claim, showing skepticism toward U.S. territorial ambitions. Experts conclude that Greenlanders do not want to become a U.S. territory, and any narrative suggesting otherwise is driven by U.S. political interests rather than factual evidence.;Claim That Greenlanders Want to Be American Territory is False;The Claim: Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna and others in Donald Trump's circle repeatedly assert that the Greenlandic population largely supports becoming an American territory.

While Patriot Polling presented a contrary survey showing 57% support, experts dismiss this poll due to questionable methodology, including calling landlines which do not exist in Greenland. Greenlandic politicians, including the new Prime Minister, have also strongly distanced themselves from statements about annexation.  The Verdict: False. There is no credible evidence to suggest that the Greenlandic population wants to become an American territory. The claims are repeatedly refuted by reliable polls and statements from Greenlandic leadership, with the supporting poll being widely discredited.;Here's the final verdict based on the fact-check: 1. What is the claim being assessed? The claim being assessed is that the Greenlandic population is a big supporter of potentially becoming an American territory, as repeatedly asserted by Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna and figures within Donald Trump's circle. 2. What is the verdict (true/false/mixed/other relevant verdict category)? False. 3. What reasoning or evidence supports this decision? The primary evidence refuting the claim comes from a poll conducted by the research institute Verian, which found that a significant majority (85%) of Greenlanders do not want to leave the Commonwealth and become part of the United States, with only 6% supporting the idea. While another organization, Patriot Polling, presented a poll showing 57% support, experts like Ulrik Pram Gad from the Danish Institute for International Studies (DIIS) have largely discredited it, citing deeply flawed methodology (e.g., claiming to call landlines, which don't exist in Greenland) and suggesting the numbers may be tampered with, or ... freely invented. Furthermore, Greenlandic political leaders, including the current Prime Minister, have consistently and strongly distanced themselves from Donald Trump's statements about annexing Greenland.;Greenlanders Want to Be Part of the US: FALSE - 85% of Greenlanders Oppose Joining the United States, Poll Shows;The Claim: The claim being assessed is that Greenlanders want to become part of the United States, a statement repeatedly made by Donald Trump and his supporters, including Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna and podcaster Charlie Kirk. The Evidence: The main evidence provided to evaluate the claim is a poll conducted by Verian, which found that only 6% of Greenlanders want to leave the Commonwealth and join the US, while 85% answered no. This poll is contrasted with a Patriot Polling survey that suggested 57% of Greenlanders support joining the US, but experts have questioned the validity of this poll, citing methodological flaws, including the fact that there are no landlines in Greenland, which was the supposed method of data collection. The Verdict: Based on the Verian poll, the claim that Greenlanders want to become part of the United States is false. Experts, including Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen and Ulrik Pram Gad, agree that the overwhelming majority of Greenlanders do not want to join the US, and recent election results and party positions also suggest skepticism towards US involvement. While there is interest in exploring potential agreements with the US, Greenlanders prioritize independence, and politicians have become more reserved towards cooperation with the US after Trump's statements about annexation ¹.;The claim being assessed is that Greenlanders want to become part of the United States, a statement repeatedly made by Donald Trump and his supporters. Verdict: False Reasoning and Evidence: A poll conducted by Verian in January 2025 found that 85% of Greenlanders do not want to leave the Danish Realm and become part of the United States, while only 6% want to join the US. This overwhelming majority against joining the US supports the verdict that the claim is false. Additionally, experts have questioned the validity of a Patriot Polling survey that suggested 57% of Greenlanders support joining the US, citing methodological flaws. Recent election results and party positions in Greenland also suggest skepticism towards US involvement, further supporting the verdict ¹.;Claim That Greenlanders Want to Join US Debunked as False: Polls Show Overwhelming Opposition;The Claim: Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna and others in Donald Trump’s circle, including Trump himself, have claimed that Greenlanders want to become part of the United States, with Luna stating on Fox News that the Greenlandic population strongly supports becoming an American territory. - The Evidence: A Verian poll shows only 6% of Greenlanders support joining the US, while 85% oppose it. A Patriot Polling survey, cited by Trump supporters, claimed 57% support, but experts, including Ulrik Pram Gad, dismiss it as unreliable due to methodological flaws, such as claiming to use landline calls, which don’t exist in Greenland. A Pew Research Center poll indicates 54% of Americans oppose taking over Greenland, with only 23% in favor. - The Verdict: The claim is false. The Verian poll, despite some methodological limitations, strongly indicates Greenlanders do not want to join the US, and the Patriot Polling survey lacks credibility. Greenlandic election results and statements from party leaders further confirm opposition to US annexation.;1. Claim Being Assessed: The claim, made by Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna and others in Donald Trump’s circle, including Trump himself, is that Greenlanders want to become part of the United States, with Luna specifically stating on Fox News that the Greenlandic population strongly supports becoming an American territory. 2. Verdict: False. 3. Reasoning and Evidence: The claim is refuted by a Verian poll, which found only 6% of Greenlanders support joining the US, while 85% oppose it, directly contradicting the assertion of widespread support. Although the Verian poll has methodological limitations, its results are considered a strong indication of Greenlandic sentiment. Conversely, a Patriot Polling survey cited by Trump supporters, claiming 57% support, is dismissed by experts like Ulrik Pram Gad due to methodological flaws, including the false claim of using landline calls, which do not exist in Greenland. Additionally, Greenland’s recent parliamentary election results, where the Trump-skeptical Demokraatit party won, and statements from Greenlandic party leaders rejecting US annexation further undermine the claim. The evidence collectively shows no significant support among Greenlanders for becoming part of the US, rendering the claim false.
FC_02;Bullet point summary;The Trump circle again makes the false claim that Greenlanders want to be part of the United States;American Trump supporters continue to claim that Greenlanders want to be part of the United States.  But there is nothing to indicate that this is the wish of the Greenlanders.   According to a researcher, the Trump administration is trying to convince a skeptical American public that annexing Greenland is a good idea.  But we do not know the Greenlanders' position on negotiating a cooperation agreement with the United States, and such an option is still on the table.;This is the fact-check :While US Vice President JD Vance was visiting American soldiers at Pituffik Space Base in northwestern Greenland at the end of March, Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna was on live air on Fox News .Here she said that not only is Greenland a strategically good place for the United States, but the Greenlandic population is a big supporter of potentially becoming an American territory.It is far from the first time that President Donald Trump himself or his circle of supporters have said that Greenlanders would like to be part of the United States. Back in January, the president claimed, in connection with his desire to take over Greenland, for example , that “the Greenlandic people will be with us.”So is there really anything to talk about? Do Greenlanders want to belong to the United States, since the Trump circle keeps repeating it?Live on Fox News, Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna reiterates that Greenlanders want to be American territory.Wants American supportNo, there is nothing to suggest that at all, says Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen , an associate professor at the Danish Defence Academy's Centre for Arctic Security Studies, referring to a poll by the research institute Verian .The same poll was also used back in January to refute Donald Trump's claim that Greenlanders want to be part of the United States. Verian's poll found that only six percent of Greenlanders want to leave the Commonwealth and instead become part of the United States. A full 85 percent answered no to the same question. Yet Trump supporters seem to be sticking to the claim. The reason for this must be found within American borders, believes Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen.In the US, the idea of taking over Greenland is also unpopular. The Trump administration is trying to influence public opinion so that it will appear as a good idea. It requires a narrative that the US can really get a lot out of it, and that the Greenlanders are on board with it, he says.A new poll from the Pew Research Center shows that there is low support among Americans for Trump's plan to take over Greenland. 54 percent do not believe that the United States should take over Greenland, while 23 percent are in favor.Fraudulent measurementHowever, there is one opinion poll that supports the Trump circle's interpretation of the Greenlanders' position. Back in January, the organization Patriot Polling presented startling figures shortly after Donald Trump Jr.'s visit to Nuuk. A full 57 percent of Greenlanders reportedly supported the idea of Greenland joining the United States.The Trump-loyal podcaster Charlie Kirk, who was with Donald Trump Jr. in Nuuk, circulated the poll and said that Greenlanders want to be part of the United States . However, experts have since denied that the numbers say anything precise about Greenlanders' attitudes.Either the numbers have been tampered with, or they are freely invented , says Ulrik Pram Gad, a senior researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies (DIIS).“I'm not sure they've even spoken to anyone in Greenland. According to the methodology description, Patriot Polling calls landlines. But there are no landlines in Greenland at all,” he says.  The Verian poll is not perfect either, says Ulrik Pram Gad, because it is difficult to conduct polls in Greenland. Verian's Greenlandic respondents were not selected representatively, just as in the aforementioned question they are asked two things at once. That is, both whether they want to leave the Commonwealth and whether they want to join the USA.“It is methodologically fragile, but the answers are so overwhelming that you can take it as a strong indication that Greenlanders do not want to be part of the USA,” says Ulrik Pram Gad.The people of Greenland want to join America! https:;Least-to-most ;Claim That Greenlanders Want to Join the United States Is False, Polls and Experts Confirm;1. Verdict: The claim that Greenlanders want to become part of the United States is false. 2. Evidence:  A poll by the research institute Verian found only 6% of Greenlanders want to leave the Commonwealth and join the US, while 85% said no.  Experts, including Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen (Danish Defence Academy) and Ulrik Pram Gad (Danish Institute for International Studies), agree there is no substantial support in Greenland for becoming a US territory.  The Patriot Polling poll (57% support) cited by Trump supporters is discredited due to flawed methodology, such as calling non-existent Greenlandic landlines.  Greenlandic political parties and leaders have publicly rejected the idea of becoming a US territory, especially after recent elections that favored more skeptical or Commonwealth-friendly parties.  While there is interest in closer cooperation with the US, no concrete offers or clear benefits have been presented to Greenlanders, and polls on such alternatives do not exist.  American public opinion is also largely against the idea of annexing Greenland. 3. Claim: Greenlanders want to become part of the United States, as repeatedly stated by Donald Trump, his supporters, and some US politicians. --- Cohesive Summary: The fact-check investigates the claim that Greenlanders desire to become a US territory, a position often repeated by former President Donald Trump, his supporters, and certain US politicians like Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna. However, multiple sources and polls contradict this claim. The Verian poll shows only a small fraction (6%) of Greenlanders favor leaving the Commonwealth to join the US, with a large majority opposing it. The more favorable poll cited by Trump supporters, from Patriot Polling, is widely discredited due to methodological flaws, including the impossible use of landline calls in Greenland. Greenlandic political leaders have also distanced themselves from the notion, especially after elections that favored parties skeptical of US annexation. While there is some openness to increased cooperation between Greenland and the US, no formal offer or clear benefits have been outlined, and public opinion in Greenland remains largely against becoming American territory. Based on this evidence, the claim that Greenlanders want to become part of the US is false.;Here you go: 1. What is the claim being evaluated? The claim is that Greenlanders want to become part of the United States. 2. Based on the evidence provided, is the claim true, false, mixed or another verdict category? The claim is false. 3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict?  A reputable poll (Verian) shows only 6% of Greenlanders support joining the US, while 85% oppose it.  The poll cited by Trump supporters (Patriot Polling) is discredited due to flawed methodology and likely inaccurate data.  Greenlandic political leaders and parties have publicly rejected the idea of annexation by the US, especially after recent elections.  Experts affirm there is no meaningful Greenlandic support for becoming a US territory, and American public opinion also largely opposes the idea. --- Final Verdict: The claim that Greenlanders want to become part of the United States is false. Reliable polling and expert analysis show overwhelming opposition among Greenlanders to joining the US, while the poll cited by proponents of the claim is methodologically flawed and not credible. Greenlandic politicians also reject the notion, confirming the lack of local support.;Claim That Greenlanders Want to Be U.S. Territory Is False; 1. Verdict: False.  2. Evidence:  A poll by the research institute Verian found that only 6% of Greenlanders want to become part of the United States, while a strong majority of 85% answered no to this question.  Another poll by Patriot Polling, which claimed 57% support for joining the US, has been widely discredited by experts as potentially tampered with or freely invented due to methodological flaws (e.g., claiming to call landlines when there are none in Greenland).  Recent Greenlandic parliamentary elections saw one of the most Trump-skeptical parties, Demokraatit, win, and the subsequent coalition agreement is described as more reserved towards the United States.  Greenlandic party leaders have strongly distanced themselves from Donald Trump's statements about annexing or controlling Greenland.  Support among Americans for Trump's plan to take over Greenland is also low, with 54% against and 23% in favor, according to the Pew Research Center.  3. Claim: Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, and other members of Donald Trump's circle, claim that the Greenlandic population is a big supporter of potentially becoming an American territory.  Cohesive Summary: The claim that the Greenlandic population is a big supporter of potentially becoming an American territory, repeatedly asserted by Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna and others in Donald Trump's circle, is false. Overwhelming evidence refutes this assertion. A reputable poll conducted by the research institute Verian found that only 6% of Greenlanders wish to join the United States, with a significant 85% opposing the idea. While one poll by Patriot Polling suggested 57% support, experts have largely dismissed it as unreliable, citing significant methodological flaws, such as claiming to have called landlines in a country where they do not exist. Furthermore, recent political developments in Greenland contradict the claim, as the more Trump-skeptical Demokraatit party won the latest parliamentary elections, and the subsequent coalition agreement reflects increased reservation towards the United States. Greenlandic political leaders have also publicly distanced themselves from any notions of annexation. This persistent narrative from the Trump circle appears to be an attempt to influence American public opinion, as support for acquiring Greenland is low even within the United States.; 1. What is the claim being evaluated? The claim being evaluated is that the Greenlandic population is a big supporter of potentially becoming an American territory. This assertion has been repeatedly made by Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna and other members of Donald Trump's circle.  2. Based on the evidence provided, is the claim true, false, mixed or another verdict category? False.  3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict? The claim is demonstrably false based on overwhelming evidence. A reliable poll by the research institute Verian indicates that a mere 6% of Greenlanders wish to join the United States, while a substantial 85% explicitly reject the idea. Conversely, a poll by Patriot Polling, which showed 57% support for joining the US, has been discredited by experts due to severe methodological flaws, suggesting the numbers may be fabricated. Furthermore, recent political outcomes in Greenland, including the victory of the Trump-skeptical Demokraatit party in parliamentary elections and the subsequent more reserved stance in their coalition agreement towards the United States, directly contradict the claim. Greenlandic political leaders have consistently and strongly distanced themselves from any notions of annexation by the United States. Even within the US, public support for Trump's plan to acquire Greenland is low.  Final Verdict: The claim that the Greenlandic population is a big supporter of potentially becoming an American territory is False. Evidence from multiple reputable polls and the statements and actions of Greenlandic political leaders clearly indicate that the vast majority of Greenlanders do not wish to become part of the United States.;Fact-Check: Greenlanders Overwhelmingly Reject Idea of Becoming US Territory;1. Verdict: The claim is false. 2. Evidence: The key pieces of evidence refuting the claim include: A poll conducted by Verian in January 2025, which found that 85% of Greenlanders do not want to leave the Danish Realm and become part of the United States, while only 6% want to join the US. Expert opinions from Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen and Ulrik Pram Gad, who question the validity of a Patriot Polling survey that suggested a majority of Greenlanders support joining the US. The fact that all Greenlandic party leaders have distanced themselves from Donald Trump's statements about annexing Greenland. 3. Claim: The main statement being fact-checked is that Greenlanders want to be part of the United States or are supporters of potentially becoming an American territory, a claim repeatedly made by Trump supporters, including Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna and podcaster Charlie Kirk. Cohesive Summary The claim that Greenlanders want to be part of the United States is false, based on evidence from a Verian poll showing an overwhelming majority (85%) of Greenlanders reject the idea of joining the US. Expert opinions also highlight the questionable methodology of a Patriot Polling survey that suggested the opposite. Furthermore, Greenlandic party leaders have distanced themselves from Trump's annexation statements.

Widespread coverage of this poll in reputable news outlets, including Reuters, Bloomberg, The Guardian, and others, all of which reported the same overwhelming opposition to joining the US. Expert opinions questioning the validity of a Patriot Polling survey that suggested a majority of Greenlanders support joining the US. Final Verdict The claim that Greenlanders want to be part of the United States is false. The overwhelming majority of Greenlanders (85%) oppose joining the US, according to a Verian poll conducted in January 2025. This poll's findings have been widely reported in reputable news outlets, further supporting the conclusion that the claim is false ¹.;Fact-Check: Claim That Greenlanders Want to Join U.S. Is False;1.

Claim: The main claim is that Greenlanders want to become part of the United States, as stated by Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, Donald Trump, and other Trump supporters like Charlie Kirk. Summary: The claim that Greenlanders want to become part of the United States, repeatedly made by figures like Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna and Donald Trump, is false. A Verian poll, despite some methodological limitations, shows overwhelming opposition, with only 6% of Greenlanders supporting joining the U.S. and 85% opposing it. In contrast, a Patriot Polling survey claiming 57% support is dismissed by experts as unreliable, likely fabricated, due to its flawed methodology, including references to non-existent landline calls in Greenland. Greenland’s recent parliamentary election further undermines the claim, as the Trump-skeptical Demokraatit party won, signaling resistance to U.S. annexation. Additionally, low American support for the idea, with 54% opposing it according to a Pew Research Center poll, suggests the claim is also a strategic narrative to sway U.S. public opinion. No credible evidence supports the assertion that Greenlanders desire U.S. territorial status, leading to the conclusion that the claim is false.;1. What is the claim being evaluated? The claim is that Greenlanders want to become part of the United States, as stated by Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, Donald Trump, and other Trump supporters like Charlie Kirk. 2. Based on the evidence provided, is the claim true, false, mixed, or another verdict category? The claim is false. 3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict?

Greenlandic leaders have also distanced themselves from Trump’s annexation statements. No credible evidence supports the claim that Greenlanders want to be part of the U.S. Final Verdict: The claim that Greenlanders want to become part of the United States is false. Evidence from a Verian poll shows overwhelming opposition (85% against, 6% in favor), and the unreliable Patriot Polling survey, dismissed for methodological errors, fails to provide credible support. The recent election of the Trump-skeptical Demokraatit party and statements from Greenlandic leaders further confirm that Greenlanders do not support becoming U.S. territory.

Evidence:  A reputable poll by the research institute Verian found only 6% of Greenlanders support leaving the Danish Commonwealth to join the U.S., while 85% oppose it.  Experts highlight that a widely cited poll by Patriot Polling, which claimed 57% support for joining the U.S., is methodologically flawed and likely inaccurate because it relied on landline calls in a place with no landlines.  Greenlandic political developments show that pro-U.S. parties gained some ground but the most popular parties remain Commonwealth-friendly and skeptical of U.S. annexation.  Greenlandic leaders have publicly distanced themselves from the idea of becoming a U.S. territory.  There is interest in closer U.S.-Greenland cooperation, but no formal offers or detailed proposals have been made, and no polls exist on such nuanced options.  Both Greenlanders and experts view the narrative of widespread Greenlandic desire to join the U.S. as misleading and not supported by credible evidence. Verdict: The claim that Greenlanders want to become American territory is false. Reliable polling and political developments clearly show that the vast majority of Greenlanders do not support U.S. annexation. The narrative is primarily driven by U.S. political interests and is not grounded in Greenlandic public opinion.;1. Claim: Greenlanders want to become part of the United States, supporting U.S. annexation of Greenland. 2. Verdict: False. 3. Explanation: Multiple reliable polls, including one by Verian, show that only a small minority of Greenlanders support joining the U.S., with the vast majority preferring to remain under Danish Commonwealth status. The pro-annexation poll cited by some Trump supporters has been discredited due to flawed methodology. Greenlandic political leaders and parties have publicly rejected U.S. annexation, and there is no credible evidence that Greenland’s population broadly desires to become American territory. The claim is mainly driven by U.S. political narratives rather than actual Greenlandic public opinion.;Claims of Widespread Greenlandic Support for U.S. Territory Status Are False;Claim: Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna and others in Donald Trump's circle have repeatedly claimed that the Greenlandic population is largely supportive of becoming an American territory. Evidence:  A poll by the research institute Verian found that only 6% of Greenlanders want to leave the Commonwealth and become part of the United States, while a full 85% answered no to this question. While the Verian poll has methodological weaknesses (respondents not representatively selected, asking two things at once), the overwhelming nature of the results strongly indicates a lack of desire to join the US.  Another poll from the Pew Research Center shows low support among Americans for Trump's plan to take over Greenland, with 54% opposed and only 23% in favor.  A contradictory poll from Patriot Polling claimed 57% of Greenlanders supported joining the US. However, experts, including senior researcher Ulrik Pram Gad, have dismissed this poll as likely tampered with or freely invented, noting that its stated methodology of calling landlines is impossible in Greenland, where landlines do not exist.  Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen of the Danish Defence Academy states there is nothing to suggest at all that Greenlanders want to be part of the US. He believes the Trump administration promotes this narrative to influence US public opinion.  Greenlandic political leaders, including the new Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen from the Demokraatit party (which won the recent parliamentary elections), have strongly distanced themselves from Trump's statements about annexing Greenland. The Demokraatit party is described as one of the most Trump-skeptical.  While some US officials, like former US Arctic Commissioner Tom Dans, suggest a closer partnership could take many forms, no concrete offers have been made or polled. Verdict: False. The overwhelming evidence, particularly from the Verian poll and statements from Greenlandic political leaders and experts, strongly indicates that the vast majority of Greenlanders do not wish to become an American territory. Claims to the contrary are based on a discredited poll and appear to be part of a narrative aimed at influencing public opinion within the United States.;Claim: Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna and others in Donald Trump's circle repeatedly assert that the Greenlandic population largely supports becoming an American territory. Verdict: False. Explanation: Evidence from a credible poll by Verian, widely reported, indicates that only 6% of Greenlanders desire to become a U.S. territory, with a vast majority (85%) opposing the idea. While acknowledging minor methodological limitations, the overwhelming numbers from this poll provide strong evidence against the claim. Conversely, the only poll supporting the Trump circle's claim (Patriot Polling) has been widely discredited by experts due to its questionable methodology, including the purported use of landlines which do not exist in Greenland. Furthermore, Greenlandic political leaders, including the newly elected Prime Minister, have explicitly distanced themselves from the idea of annexation, reinforcing that Greenland is not interested in becoming part of the United States.;No Evidence Supports Claim That Greenlanders Want to Become Part of the United States;The claim being evaluated is that Greenlanders want to become part of the United States, as stated by Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna and previously by President Donald Trump. Evidence The key pieces of evidence provided to support or dispute this claim include: A poll conducted by Verian in January 2025, which found that 85% of Greenlanders do not want to leave the Danish Realm and become part of the United States, while 6% do want to join the US. A contradictory poll by Patriot Polling, which claimed 57% of Greenlanders support joining the US, but experts have questioned the validity of this poll due to methodological concerns, such as the lack of landlines in Greenland. Expert opinions from Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen and Ulrik Pram Gad, who argue that the Verian poll's results are more reliable despite some methodological limitations. The outcome of the Greenlandic parliamentary elections, which saw the Trump-skeptical party Demokraatit win, while the pro-US party Naleraq made some progress but not as much as the Commonwealth-friendly Democrats. Verdict Based on the evidence, the final judgment on the claim is False. The overwhelming majority of Greenlanders, as indicated by the Verian poll, do not want to become part of the United States. While there are some limitations to the poll, experts consider the results to be a strong indication of Greenlanders' attitudes. The disputed Patriot Polling results and interpretations by Trump supporters do not provide sufficient evidence to contradict the Verian poll's findings ¹.;Fact-Check Verdict 1. Claim Being Assessed The claim being assessed is that Greenlanders want to become part of the United States, as stated by Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna and previously by President Donald Trump. 2. Final Verdict False 3. Evidence Supporting the Verdict A recent opinion poll conducted by Verian found that 85% of Greenlanders do not want to leave the Danish Realm and become part of the United States, while only 6% want to join the US. This overwhelming majority against joining the US indicates that the claim is false. Although there's a contradictory poll by Patriot Polling claiming 57% of Greenlanders support joining the US, experts have questioned its validity due to methodological concerns. The Verian poll's results are considered more reliable, and the Greenlandic parliamentary elections also suggest that the population is not tempted by the idea of becoming part of the US ¹.;False: Greenlanders Do Not Support Becoming U.S. Territory, Despite Trump Circle Claims;Claim: Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna and others in Donald Trump’s circle, including Trump himself, have claimed that Greenlanders strongly support becoming an American territory. Evidence: A Verian poll found that only 6% of Greenlanders want to leave the Danish Commonwealth and join the United States, while 85% oppose it. This contradicts the claims made by Trump supporters. A Patriot Polling survey, cited by Trump ally Charlie Kirk, claimed 57% of Greenlanders supported joining the U.S., but experts, including Ulrik Pram Gad from the Danish Institute for International Studies, dismissed it as unreliable, noting that Greenland lacks landlines, which the poll supposedly used. Additionally, recent Greenlandic election results show strong support for the Trump-skeptical Demokraatit party, and all Greenlandic party leaders have rejected Trump’s annexation claims. A Pew Research Center poll also indicates low American support (23%) for taking over Greenland. Verdict: False. The claim that Greenlanders want to become an American territory is not supported by credible evidence. The Verian poll overwhelmingly shows Greenlanders oppose the idea, and the Patriot Polling survey lacks validity due to methodological flaws. Greenlandic election outcomes and political statements further refute the claim.;Claim: Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna and others in Donald Trump’s circle, including Trump himself, have claimed that Greenlanders strongly support becoming an American territory. Verdict: False. Explanation: The evidence overwhelmingly contradicts the claim. A Verian poll shows only 6% of Greenlanders support joining the U.S., while 85% oppose leaving the Danish Commonwealth. The Patriot Polling survey, which claimed 57% support, is unreliable due to methodological flaws, such as claiming to use landlines, which do not exist in Greenland. Recent Greenlandic election results favor the Trump-skeptical Demokraatit party, and all Greenlandic party leaders have rejected annexation claims. These findings, combined with low American support for the idea (23% per Pew Research Center), demonstrate that the claim lacks credible support.
FC_02;Bullet point summary;The Trump circle again makes the false claim that Greenlanders want to be part of the United States;American Trump supporters continue to claim that Greenlanders want to be part of the United States.  But there is nothing to indicate that this is the wish of the Greenlanders.   According to a researcher, the Trump administration is trying to convince a skeptical American public that annexing Greenland is a good idea.  But we do not know the Greenlanders' position on negotiating a cooperation agreement with the United States, and such an option is still on the table.;This is the fact-check :While US Vice President JD Vance was visiting American soldiers at Pituffik Space Base in northwestern Greenland at the end of March, Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna was on live air on Fox News .Here she said that not only is Greenland a strategically good place for the United States, but the Greenlandic population is a big supporter of potentially becoming an American territory.It is far from the first time that President Donald Trump himself or his circle of supporters have said that Greenlanders would like to be part of the United States. Back in January, the president claimed, in connection with his desire to take over Greenland, for example , that “the Greenlandic people will be with us.”So is there really anything to talk about? Do Greenlanders want to belong to the United States, since the Trump circle keeps repeating it?Live on Fox News, Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna reiterates that Greenlanders want to be American territory.Wants American supportNo, there is nothing to suggest that at all, says Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen , an associate professor at the Danish Defence Academy's Centre for Arctic Security Studies, referring to a poll by the research institute Verian .The same poll was also used back in January to refute Donald Trump's claim that Greenlanders want to be part of the United States. Verian's poll found that only six percent of Greenlanders want to leave the Commonwealth and instead become part of the United States. A full 85 percent answered no to the same question. Yet Trump supporters seem to be sticking to the claim. The reason for this must be found within American borders, believes Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen.In the US, the idea of taking over Greenland is also unpopular. The Trump administration is trying to influence public opinion so that it will appear as a good idea. It requires a narrative that the US can really get a lot out of it, and that the Greenlanders are on board with it, he says.A new poll from the Pew Research Center shows that there is low support among Americans for Trump's plan to take over Greenland. 54 percent do not believe that the United States should take over Greenland, while 23 percent are in favor.Fraudulent measurementHowever, there is one opinion poll that supports the Trump circle's interpretation of the Greenlanders' position. Back in January, the organization Patriot Polling presented startling figures shortly after Donald Trump Jr.'s visit to Nuuk. A full 57 percent of Greenlanders reportedly supported the idea of Greenland joining the United States.The Trump-loyal podcaster Charlie Kirk, who was with Donald Trump Jr. in Nuuk, circulated the poll and said that Greenlanders want to be part of the United States . However, experts have since denied that the numbers say anything precise about Greenlanders' attitudes.Either the numbers have been tampered with, or they are freely invented , says Ulrik Pram Gad, a senior researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies (DIIS).“I'm not sure they've even spoken to anyone in Greenland. According to the methodology description, Patriot Polling calls landlines. But there are no landlines in Greenland at all,” he says.  The Verian poll is not perfect either, says Ulrik Pram Gad, because it is difficult to conduct polls in Greenland. Verian's Greenlandic respondents were not selected representatively, just as in the aforementioned question they are asked two things at once. That is, both whether they want to leave the Commonwealth and whether they want to join the USA.“It is methodologically fragile, but the answers are so overwhelming that you can take it as a strong indication that Greenlanders do not want to be part of the USA,” says Ulrik Pram Gad.The people of Greenland want to join America! https:;Zero-shot;Claim That Greenlanders Want to Join the U.S. Is False, Polls and Experts Show;"Claim being evaluated: Greenlanders want to become part of the United States, as repeatedly stated by Donald Trump, his supporters, and Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna. Key evidence:  A poll by research institute Verian found only 6% of Greenlanders want to leave the Commonwealth to join the U.S., while 85% do not.  Experts criticize a pro-Trump poll (Patriot Polling) claiming 57% support for joining the U.S. as methodologically flawed or fabricated, since it used landline calls in a region without landlines.  Greenlandic election results show limited support for pro-U.S. parties; the most Trump-skeptical party won.  Greenlandic political leaders have publicly rejected the idea of annexation by the U.S.  Experts and Greenlandic officials indicate Greenlanders mainly want independence from Denmark, not U.S. territory.  There is interest in closer U.S.-Greenland cooperation but not annexation; no polls exist on such partnerships. Verdict: False. There is no credible evidence that Greenlanders broadly want to become U.S. territory. The claim is based on misleading or unreliable polling and contradicts clear public opinion and political realities in Greenland.";1. Claim being evaluated: Greenlanders want to become part of the United States. 2. Verdict: False. 3. Explanation: Multiple reliable polls and expert analyses show that the vast majority of Greenlanders do not support becoming a U.S. territory. The widely cited pro-Trump poll claiming majority support is methodologically flawed or possibly fabricated. Greenlandic political leaders and election results also indicate opposition to annexation. While there is some interest in closer cooperation with the U.S., the evidence strongly contradicts the claim that Greenlanders want to join the United States.;No Evidence Greenlanders Want to Become US Territory, Despite Trump Allies' Claims;Claim Evaluated: The claim is that the Greenlandic population is a big supporter of potentially becoming an American territory, as repeatedly asserted by Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna and others within Donald Trump's circle. Key Evidence:  Verian Poll: A poll by the research institute Verian indicates that only six percent of Greenlanders want to leave the Commonwealth and join the United States, while a significant 85 percent oppose the idea. Although acknowledged as methodologically fragile due to survey design and non-representative sampling, experts like Ulrik Pram Gad (DIIS) consider the overwhelming results a strong indication that Greenlanders do not want to be part of the USA.  Patriot Polling: A contradictory poll from Patriot Polling claimed 57 percent of Greenlanders supported joining the US. However, experts have largely dismissed this poll due to questionable methodology, including the claim of calling landlines when Greenland has none, leading to accusations of tampering or fabrication.  US Public Opinion: A Pew Research Center poll shows low support among Americans for the US acquiring Greenland, with 54 percent against and 23 percent in favor.  Greenlandic Election Results: Despite interpretations by pro-Trump podcaster Charlie Kirk, Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen (Danish Defence Academy) states that the recent Greenlandic parliamentary elections saw a win for Demokraatit, a party considered Trump-skeptical and Commonwealth-friendly, suggesting a lack of enthusiasm for US annexation. While Naleraq, a party perceived as pro-USA, advanced, it was not as significant as the Demokraatit's gains.  Statements from Greenlandic Leaders: Immediately after the election, all Greenlandic party leaders strongly distanced themselves from Donald Trump's statements about annexing Greenland.  Tom Dans's Perspective: Tom Dans, former US Arctic Commissioner, indicates that while Greenlanders desire independence from Denmark, no concrete offer for a closer partnership with the US has been made, making discussions of becoming a US territory an abstraction and a false choice.  Greenlandic Political Shift: Ulrik Pram Gad notes that while Greenland's previous foreign policy indicated an openness to US cooperation, the recently concluded coalition agreement shows more reserved formulations towards the United States, likely influenced by Trump's annexation rhetoric. Verdict: False. The overwhelming evidence, particularly from the Verian poll and the interpretations of Greenlandic political experts and election results, strongly refutes the claim that the Greenlandic population is a significant supporter of becoming an American territory. The one poll supporting the claim has been widely discredited. While Greenlanders desire independence, this does not translate into a desire to join the United States.;1. What is the claim being evaluated? The claim being evaluated is that the Greenlandic population is a big supporter of potentially becoming an American territory. This claim has been repeatedly made by Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna and others associated with Donald Trump. 2. Is the claim true, false, or mixed or other relevant category of verdict? False. 3. Provide a brief explanation for your decision based on the evidence presented in the fact-check. The claim is false based on overwhelming evidence. A credible poll by Verian found that only six percent of Greenlanders want to join the United States, while 85 percent answered no. A conflicting poll from Patriot Polling, which supported the claim, has been widely discredited by experts due to questionable methodology, including the assertion of calling non-existent landlines in Greenland. Furthermore, recent Greenlandic parliamentary election results, according to analysis, show a victory for a Trump-skeptical party, and Greenlandic party leaders have explicitly distanced themselves from Donald Trump's statements about annexing Greenland.;Greenlanders Don't Want to Be Part of the US: Fact-Check Reveals Overwhelming Rejection;Claim Being Evaluated: The claim that Greenlanders want to become part of the United States, as stated by Donald Trump and his supporters. Key Evidence: Verian Poll: Found that only 6% of Greenlanders want to leave the Danish Realm to become part of the United States, while 85% answered no. Patriot Polling: Claimed 57% of Greenlanders support joining the US, but experts consider this poll to be methodologically flawed or potentially fabricated due to lack of landlines in Greenland. Expert Opinions: Researchers like Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen and Ulrik Pram Gad conclude that there is no evidence to support the claim that Greenlanders want to become part of the US. Greenlandic Election Results: The winning party, Demokraatit, is Trump-skeptical, indicating that Greenlanders may not be receptive to the idea of becoming part of the US. Verdict: False. Based on the overwhelming evidence from credible sources, including polls and expert opinions, it appears that the majority of Greenlanders do not want to become part of the United States.;Fact-Check Verdict Claim Being Evaluated: The claim that Greenlanders want to become part of the United States, as stated by Donald Trump and his supporters. Verdict: False. Explanation: The claim is deemed false based on the evidence presented in the fact-check. A poll by Verian found that only 6% of Greenlanders want to leave the Danish Realm to become part of the United States, while 85% answered no. Although another poll by Patriot Polling claimed 57% of Greenlanders support joining the US, experts consider this poll to be methodologically flawed or potentially fabricated. Expert opinions and recent election results in Greenland also suggest that the population is not receptive to the idea of becoming part of the US. In fact, the winning party in the election, Demokraatit, is Trump-skeptical, further indicating that Greenlanders do not want to join the United States ¹.;False: Greenlanders Do Not Want to Join the U.S., Despite Trump Circle’s Claims;Claim Evaluated: Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna and others in Donald Trump's circle have claimed that Greenlanders want to become part of the United States as an American territory. Key Evidence: 1. A Verian poll indicates that only 6% of Greenlanders support leaving the Danish Commonwealth to join the U.S., while 85% oppose it. 2. A Pew Research Center poll shows low American support for taking over Greenland, with 54% against and 23% in favor. 3.

Greenland's recent parliamentary election saw the Commonwealth-friendly Demokraatit party win, suggesting limited support for pro-U.S. sentiments, despite the Naleraq party's gains. 5. Greenlandic party leaders have distanced themselves from Trump's annexation claims, and the new coalition agreement is more reserved toward U.S. cooperation compared to previous strategies. Verdict: False. The claim that Greenlanders want to join the United States is not supported by credible evidence. The Verian poll and Greenlandic political developments strongly indicate opposition to becoming a U.S. territory, while the Patriot Polling survey is unreliable.;1. Claim Evaluated: Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna and others in Donald Trump's circle claim that Greenlanders want to become part of the United States as an American territory. 2. Verdict: False. 3. Explanation: The claim is unsupported by credible evidence. A Verian poll shows only 6% of Greenlanders support joining the U.S., with 85% opposing it. The recent Greenlandic election favored the Commonwealth-friendly Demokraatit party, and all party leaders have rejected Trump’s annexation claims. A Patriot Polling survey claiming 57% support is discredited due to methodological flaws, such as referencing non-existent landline calls in Greenland.

According to researchers, false allegations about the Ukrainian president have flared up after Donald Trump called the Ukrainian president a dictator.;This is the fact-checkUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has purchased Adolf Hitler's old summer house, Kehlsteinhaus, also known as the Eagle's Nest, for more than 100 million kroner.This is the claim in several posts on both X and Facebook , which also link the summer house purchase with the aid that Ukraine receives from the United States to wage war on Russia. The posts have been viewed hundreds of thousands of times.The posts include photos of alleged purchase contracts and a video detailing the building's history as Adolf Hitler's summer residence, while explaining that the house has now been sold to an Italian company owned by the Ukrainian president.According to the posts, the story about the summer house purchase comes from German media, but the only German media outlet that TjekDet has been able to find the story from is the unknown Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland .It turns out that the German media is actually a Russian propaganda outlet. And Zelenskyy did not buy Hitler's summer house.Hitler's summer residenceKehlsteinhaus was given to Hitler in 1939 as a 50th birthday present by German Nazi politician Martin Bormann. The building gets its name because it is located on the top of the Kehlstein mountain, a whopping 1,834 meters above sea level.Hitler's visits to the house were few and far between, however , because he disliked the heights and the elevator that had to be used to reach the house at the time. The risk of lightning strikes was also not a weather forecast that the German dictator liked.The video, now being shared on social media, shows that President Zelenskyy has purchased the building from the state-owned Bavarian company Immobilien Freistaat Bayern (IMBY), whose director, Gerhard Reichel , according to the video, comments on the sale as follows:“Such transactions with historic sites are very rare. However, in this case, due to the high state subsidy required to ensure the ongoing operation (of the building, ed.), it was only a matter of time before a sale would take place,” it says.But the statement and the sale of Kehlsteinhaus are, according to IMBY, pure fabrication.“The Kehlsteinhaus remains in the ownership of the Free State of Bavaria.

The posts have been viewed hundreds of thousands of times.The posts include photos of alleged purchase contracts and a video detailing the building's history as Adolf Hitler's summer residence, while explaining that the house has now been sold to an Italian company owned by the Ukrainian president.According to the posts, the story about the summer house purchase comes from German media, but the only German media outlet that TjekDet has been able to find the story from is the unknown Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland .It turns out that the German media is actually a Russian propaganda outlet. And Zelenskyy did not buy Hitler's summer house.Hitler's summer residenceKehlsteinhaus was given to Hitler in 1939 as a 50th birthday present by German Nazi politician Martin Bormann. The building gets its name because it is located on the top of the Kehlstein mountain, a whopping 1,834 meters above sea level.Hitler's visits to the house were few and far between, however , because he disliked the heights and the elevator that had to be used to reach the house at the time. The risk of lightning strikes was also not a weather forecast that the German dictator liked.The video, now being shared on social media, shows that President Zelenskyy has purchased the building from the state-owned Bavarian company Immobilien Freistaat Bayern (IMBY), whose director, Gerhard Reichel , according to the video, comments on the sale as follows:“Such transactions with historic sites are very rare. However, in this case, due to the high state subsidy required to ensure the ongoing operation (of the building, ed.), it was only a matter of time before a sale would take place,” it says.But the statement and the sale of Kehlsteinhaus are, according to IMBY, pure fabrication.“The Kehlsteinhaus remains in the ownership of the Free State of Bavaria.

The Evidence: The alleged purchase is based on fabricated documents, a misleading video, and a fake quote from the Bavarian state-owned company IMBY. The story originates from a fake German news outlet, Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland, which has been linked to Russian disinformation efforts.  The Verdict: The claim is entirely false. IMBY has confirmed that the Kehlsteinhaus remains state-owned, no sale occurred, and the supposed purchase contract and quotes are fake. The website spreading the story is part of a broader Russian disinformation campaign targeting Zelenskyy and Ukraine.;Verdict: False 1. The Claim: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy purchased Adolf Hitler’s former summer home, the Kehlsteinhaus (Eagle’s Nest), for over 100 million kroner, using aid money allegedly linked to U.S. support for Ukraine. 2. Key Evidence:  The story originated from Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland, a fake news site tied to Russian disinformation networks.  The alleged sale contract and quote from the state-owned Bavarian company Immobilien Freistaat Bayern (IMBY) are fabricated.  IMBY has officially denied any sale of the Kehlsteinhaus, stating it remains in the ownership of the Free State of Bavaria and no sale is planned.  The website spreading the claim is listed among over 100 fake media sites identified by the German fact-checker Correctiv as part of a Russian influence operation (Storm-1516) linked to the GRU and Internet Research Agency. 3. Justification: There is no credible evidence to support the claim. The purported documents and quotes have been proven false, and the source of the information is part of a broader disinformation effort. Therefore, the claim is demonstrably false.;Claim That Zelensky Bought Hitler's Kehlsteinhaus (Eagle's Nest) Is False, Originated from Russian Propaganda;Identify the Claim (Bullet 1):  The article explicitly states the claim: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has purchased Adolf Hitler's old summer house, Kehlsteinhaus, also known as the Eagle's Nest, for more than 100 million kroner.  The posts spreading the claim also link this purchase to the aid Ukraine receives from the US.  The claim includes alleged photos of purchase contracts and mentions a sale to an Italian company owned by Zelensky, citing German media. 3. Analyze the Article - Examine the Evidence (Bullet 2):  The article identifies the primary source cited in the posts (German media) as Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland.  TjekDet (the fact-checking organization) found this website is a Russian propaganda outlet, newly created (first activity detected December 14, 2024), and likely created to spread Russian disinformation (part of the Storm-1516 operation identified by Correctiv).  The article presents evidence from the actual owner of the Kehlsteinhaus, Immobilien Freistaat Bayern (IMBY).  IMBY denies the sale: The Kehlsteinhaus remains in the ownership of the Free State of Bavaria. A sale has not taken place and is not planned.  IMBY explicitly states the alleged purchase contract and the quote from IMBY director Gerhard Reichel are pure fabrication and false.  The false story fits a pattern of Russian influence attempts and disinformation campaigns against Zelensky (e.g., stories about his wife buying a Bugatti, Zelensky buying a hotel casino in Cyprus). 4. Analyze the Article - Determine the Verdict (Bullet 3):  The article concludes definitively that the claim is false.  The verdict is supported by the denial from the property owner (IMBY) and the exposure of the source media outlet as a Russian propaganda front. 5. Synthesize the Summary (Drafting the Bullets):  Claim: Social media posts claim Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky purchased Adolf Hitler’s former summer house, Kehlsteinhaus (the Eagle's Nest), for over 100 million kroner, linking the purchase to US aid to Ukraine.  Evidence: The alleged source, Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland, is identified as a newly established Russian propaganda outlet created to spread disinformation. The owner of the property, Immobilien Freistaat Bayern (IMBY), explicitly denies the sale, stating the Kehlsteinhaus is still owned by the Free State of Bavaria and the alleged purchase contract and quotes are fabrications.  Verdict: The claim is false. The story is a fabrication originating from a Russian disinformation campaign aimed at spreading anti-Ukrainian narratives. 6. Final Review: The drafted bullets accurately reflect the content and structure requested in the prompt.Based on the provided fact-check, here is a summary in three bullet points:  The Claim: Several posts on social media platforms (X and Facebook) asserted that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky purchased Adolf Hitler’s former summer residence, the Kehlsteinhaus (Eagle's Nest), for over 100 million kroner, linking the purchase to foreign aid received by Ukraine. The posts included fabricated purchase contracts and cited a supposedly German media outlet, Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland.  The Evidence: The fact-check revealed that the source of the story, Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland, is a Russian propaganda outlet created specifically to spread disinformation. Furthermore, Immobilien Freistaat Bayern (IMBY), the state-owned Bavarian company that owns the Kehlsteinhaus, officially stated that the building has not been sold and that the alleged purchase contract and quotes about the sale are pure fabrication.

The fact-check identifies this outlet as a Russian propaganda website, created only recently (December 14, 2024) with the aim of spreading Russian disinformation. 3. Pattern of Disinformation: The claim fits a pattern of Russian influence campaigns designed to undermine Ukrainian President Zelensky by spreading false narratives about corruption and misuse of funds, such as previous fabricated stories regarding the purchase of a Bugatti or a hotel casino.;Fact Check: Claim that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky Bought Hitler's Summer House is False; Claim: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has purchased Adolf Hitler's old summer house, Kehlsteinhaus (also known as the Eagle's Nest), for over 100 million kroner. The claim, spread through social media posts, suggests this purchase is linked to the aid Ukraine receives from the United States to wage war on Russia. Evidence: The posts claim the story comes from German media, specifically Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland. However, this outlet is actually a Russian propaganda website created to spread disinformation. The state-owned Bavarian company Immobilien Freistaat Bayern (IMBY), which allegedly sold the house, denies the sale, stating that Kehlsteinhaus remains in the ownership of the Free State of Bavaria and that no sale is planned. Verdict: The claim is false. The story about Zelensky buying Hitler's summer house is a fabrication, and the German media outlet promoting it is likely a part of a Russian disinformation campaign. This campaign may be linked to the Russian troll factory Internet Research Agency (IRA) and the Russian military intelligence service GRU, aiming to create animosity between the US and Ukraine.;The claim being evaluated is that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has purchased Adolf Hitler's old summer house, Kehlsteinhaus, also known as the Eagle's Nest, for more than 100 million kroner.

Key evidence provided to assess the claim includes: A statement from Immobilien Freistaat Bayern (IMBY), the state-owned Bavarian company that owns the building, denying the sale and stating that Kehlsteinhaus remains in the ownership of the Free State of Bavaria. An investigation into the German media outlet Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland, which published the story, revealing it to be a likely Russian propaganda website created to spread disinformation. Fact-checks from reputable sources, such as Lead Stories and AOL, confirming the claim is false. Based on this evidence, the verdict is: False.

The state-owned Bavarian company Immobilien Freistaat Bayern (IMBY) confirms Kehlsteinhaus remains in their ownership, no sale occurred, and the alleged purchase contract and quoted statement are fabricated. The website spreading the claim was created in December 2024 and is linked to Russian disinformation efforts targeting German elections. - Verdict: The claim is false. Kehlsteinhaus was not sold to Zelensky, and the story is a fabrication spread by a Russian disinformation outlet to undermine Ukraine and its leadership, particularly in light of U.S. political narratives and upcoming German elections.;Verdict: False Claim: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky purchased Adolf Hitler's former summer house, Kehlsteinhaus (Eagle's Nest), for over 100 million kroner, with the purchase tied to U.S. aid for Ukraine’s war against Russia.

The outlet fabricated a story, including fake purchase contracts and a video with a false quote from IMBY's director, Gerhard Reichel. IMBY has denied the sale, stating that Kehlsteinhaus remains in the ownership of the Free State of Bavaria and no sale is planned. Additionally, fact-checking organizations have identified Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland as one of 100 fake websites spreading Russian disinformation. The Verdict: The claim is false. The evidence shows that the story was fabricated by a Russian propaganda outlet, and IMBY has explicitly denied the sale of Kehlsteinhaus.

Denial from Authorities: The official website of Kehlsteinhaus and a spokesperson for the property have explicitly denied the sale, stating that the building remains in the ownership of the Free State of Bavaria and no sale is planned. Lack of Credible Information: There's no credible evidence to support the claim, and the property's historical significance as a memorial to Nazi crimes makes a private sale unlikely. Pattern of Disinformation: This claim follows a pattern of Russian disinformation campaigns aimed at creating animosity between the US and Ukraine, potentially to influence public opinion and negotiations. Given the evidence and reasoning above, it's clear that the claim about Zelensky buying Hitler's summer house is false and part of a larger disinformation effort.;Zelensky Did Not Buy Hitler's Kehlsteinhaus: False Claim Debunked as Russian Disinformation;The Claim: Posts on X and Facebook claim that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky purchased Adolf Hitler's former summer house, Kehlsteinhaus (Eagle's Nest), for over 100 million kroner, allegedly through an Italian company he owns, with the purchase linked to U.S. aid for Ukraine's war against Russia. - The Evidence: The claim originates from a Russian propaganda outlet, Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland, posing as a German media site, with no credible German media reporting the story.

The absence of any verifiable evidence and the clear refutation by IMBY support the conclusion that the claim is false.
FC_03;Bullet point summary;Has Zelensky bought Hitler's old summer residence?;Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has purchased Adolf Hitler's former summer home, according to several posts on social media.  But the story is fabricated and is in all likelihood an example of Russian disinformation.  According to researchers, false allegations about the Ukrainian president have flared up after Donald Trump called the Ukrainian president a dictator.;This is the fact-checkUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has purchased Adolf Hitler's old summer house, Kehlsteinhaus, also known as the Eagle's Nest, for more than 100 million kroner.This is the claim in several posts on both X and Facebook , which also link the summer house purchase with the aid that Ukraine receives from the United States to wage war on Russia. The posts have been viewed hundreds of thousands of times.The posts include photos of alleged purchase contracts and a video detailing the building's history as Adolf Hitler's summer residence, while explaining that the house has now been sold to an Italian company owned by the Ukrainian president.According to the posts, the story about the summer house purchase comes from German media, but the only German media outlet that TjekDet has been able to find the story from is the unknown Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland .It turns out that the German media is actually a Russian propaganda outlet. And Zelenskyy did not buy Hitler's summer house.Hitler's summer residenceKehlsteinhaus was given to Hitler in 1939 as a 50th birthday present by German Nazi politician Martin Bormann. The building gets its name because it is located on the top of the Kehlstein mountain, a whopping 1,834 meters above sea level.Hitler's visits to the house were few and far between, however , because he disliked the heights and the elevator that had to be used to reach the house at the time. The risk of lightning strikes was also not a weather forecast that the German dictator liked.The video, now being shared on social media, shows that President Zelenskyy has purchased the building from the state-owned Bavarian company Immobilien Freistaat Bayern (IMBY), whose director, Gerhard Reichel , according to the video, comments on the sale as follows:“Such transactions with historic sites are very rare. However, in this case, due to the high state subsidy required to ensure the ongoing operation (of the building, ed.), it was only a matter of time before a sale would take place,” it says.But the statement and the sale of Kehlsteinhaus are, according to IMBY, pure fabrication.“The Kehlsteinhaus remains in the ownership of the Free State of Bavaria. A sale has not taken place and is not planned. The alleged purchase contract shown in the video is false, as is the alleged quote from the IMBY management,” IMBY states on their website .They also state that they will take legal action against those who spread the false information on the internet.Volodymyr Zelenskyj bought the Kehlsteinhaus, which previously belonged to Hitler, writes the media outlet Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland, which is apparently German. But the website hides a secret. Photo: Screenshot.The arrow points towards RussiaAs mentioned, the false story was published by the “German” media outlet Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland, and it is most likely a website created for the purpose of spreading Russian disinformation.CheckDet has not been able to find any traces of the media website from before December 14, 2024. According to various services that monitor changes to websites, the first activity on the website was seen on that very day. It was also on December 14 that the website was first archived through the Wayback Machine service.If you search for the website on Google, there are no results from before December 2024.The website also appears on the list of 100 fake websites that, among others, the German fact-checking media Correctiv has identified as being created with the aim of spreading Russian disinformation ahead of the German elections on February 23, 2025.Correctiv has dubbed the influence operation Storm-1516, and according to the media outlet, the operation has links to the Russian troll factory Internet Research Agency (IRA) and the Russian military intelligence service GRU.The false story also ties in with many other stories about Volodymyr Zelenskyj, which TjekDet has previously fact-checked. Among other things, the president's wife is said to have acquired a Bugatti , and Zelenskyj himself is said to have bought a hotel casino in Cyprus .And the strategy seems to be the same.The Bugatti story was also published on a newly created website that, like Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland, imitates a real news site, where a few fake ones are planted among a sea of true stories - typically with an angle on Russia. Probably to strengthen credibility.Reaction to Trump's dictator accusationThe news outlet AFP writes that false allegations about Volodymyr Zelensky have flared up after US President Donald Trump, among other things, called the Ukrainian president a dictator.We have observed a significant resurgence of anti-Ukrainian disinformation on US social media, much of which appears to be recycled content from previous Russian influence campaigns, McKenzie Sadeghi, an analyst at disinformation watchdog NewsGuard, told AFP .Trump's comments appear to have sparked renewed interest in anti-Ukrainian narratives that had previously faded, Sadeghi further told AFP .Joseph Bodnar, a researcher at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, explains to AFP that the Russian influence attempts focus on creating animosity between the Trump and Zelenskyy administrations.Russia wants to convince American negotiators that Ukraine is their enemy, not their ally. It is a means for the Kremlin to obtain favorable terms in any peace agreement that may come.;Least-to-most ;False Claim: Zelensky Did Not Buy Hitler’s Former Summer House, the Kehlsteinhaus;1. Verdict: The claim is false. 2. Evidence:  The claim originates from a suspicious “German” media outlet called Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland, which is identified as a Russian propaganda site created only in December 2024.  The Bavarian state-owned company Immobilien Freistaat Bayern (IMBY), which owns Kehlsteinhaus (Hitler’s Eagle’s Nest), officially denies any sale and calls the alleged purchase contract and quotes fabricated.  Kehlsteinhaus remains owned by the Free State of Bavaria, with no plans to sell it.  The disinformation website is part of a known Russian influence operation (Storm-1516), linked to Russian troll groups and military intelligence.  Similar false stories about Zelensky (e.g., buying a Bugatti or a casino) have been circulated from newly created fake websites mimicking real news outlets.  Analysts confirm a surge in anti-Ukrainian disinformation on social media tied to broader geopolitical narratives, especially following US President Trump’s comments about Zelensky. 3.

This assertion was published by a dubious “German” media outlet, Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland, which was established recently and identified as a Russian propaganda platform designed to spread disinformation. The actual owner of the property, the Bavarian state-owned company Immobilien Freistaat Bayern (IMBY), categorically denies any sale of the Kehlsteinhaus, labeling the alleged contract and quotes as fabricated. The property remains under Bavarian state ownership with no sale planned. Furthermore, the website promoting this story is part of a larger Russian influence campaign aimed at discrediting Zelensky and sowing discord around US-Ukraine relations. Similar fabricated stories about Zelensky have surfaced from other fake news sites, reinforcing the pattern of disinformation. Expert analysts confirm this misinformation surge is linked to geopolitical motives, especially amid tensions following comments by US President Donald Trump about Zelensky. Thus, the evidence conclusively refutes the claim.;1. What is the claim being evaluated?

The website promoting the claim is part of a known Russian disinformation campaign.  Similar false stories about Zelensky have been debunked, showing a pattern of fabricated claims used to spread disinformation. --- Final Verdict: The claim that Zelensky purchased Hitler’s summer house, the Kehlsteinhaus, is false.

These claims link the alleged purchase to the aid Ukraine receives from the United States. Summary of Evidence: The claim is false, rooted in a coordinated disinformation campaign. The original source of the story, cited as German media by social media posts, is identified as Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland. Investigations revealed this website is a Russian propaganda outlet, newly created in December 2024, and linked to the known Russian disinformation operation Storm-1516. The website mimics legitimate news sites to spread false narratives, a tactic previously observed in similar false claims about Zelensky, such as his alleged purchase of a Bugatti or a hotel casino. Crucially, the government of Bavaria, which owns the Kehlsteinhaus, has explicitly denied the sale. Immobilien Freistaat Bayern (IMBY), the state-owned company managing the property, issued a statement confirming that the Kehlsteinhaus remains in the ownership of the Free State of Bavaria. IMBY characterized the alleged purchase contract and quotes attributed to its management regarding the sale as pure fabrication and false.

IMBY also confirmed that the alleged purchase contract and the quoted statement from their management shown in the circulating video are false.

The website is part of a Russian disinformation campaign, Storm-1516, linked to the Internet Research Agency and GRU, aimed at discrediting Ukraine. This evidence conclusively shows the claim is entirely false, as no sale occurred and the supporting documents and statements are fraudulent.
FC_03;Bullet point summary;Has Zelensky bought Hitler's old summer residence?;Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has purchased Adolf Hitler's former summer home, according to several posts on social media.  But the story is fabricated and is in all likelihood an example of Russian disinformation.  According to researchers, false allegations about the Ukrainian president have flared up after Donald Trump called the Ukrainian president a dictator.;This is the fact-checkUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has purchased Adolf Hitler's old summer house, Kehlsteinhaus, also known as the Eagle's Nest, for more than 100 million kroner.This is the claim in several posts on both X and Facebook , which also link the summer house purchase with the aid that Ukraine receives from the United States to wage war on Russia. The posts have been viewed hundreds of thousands of times.The posts include photos of alleged purchase contracts and a video detailing the building's history as Adolf Hitler's summer residence, while explaining that the house has now been sold to an Italian company owned by the Ukrainian president.According to the posts, the story about the summer house purchase comes from German media, but the only German media outlet that TjekDet has been able to find the story from is the unknown Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland .It turns out that the German media is actually a Russian propaganda outlet. And Zelenskyy did not buy Hitler's summer house.Hitler's summer residenceKehlsteinhaus was given to Hitler in 1939 as a 50th birthday present by German Nazi politician Martin Bormann. The building gets its name because it is located on the top of the Kehlstein mountain, a whopping 1,834 meters above sea level.Hitler's visits to the house were few and far between, however , because he disliked the heights and the elevator that had to be used to reach the house at the time. The risk of lightning strikes was also not a weather forecast that the German dictator liked.The video, now being shared on social media, shows that President Zelenskyy has purchased the building from the state-owned Bavarian company Immobilien Freistaat Bayern (IMBY), whose director, Gerhard Reichel , according to the video, comments on the sale as follows:“Such transactions with historic sites are very rare. However, in this case, due to the high state subsidy required to ensure the ongoing operation (of the building, ed.), it was only a matter of time before a sale would take place,” it says.But the statement and the sale of Kehlsteinhaus are, according to IMBY, pure fabrication.“The Kehlsteinhaus remains in the ownership of the Free State of Bavaria. A sale has not taken place and is not planned. The alleged purchase contract shown in the video is false, as is the alleged quote from the IMBY management,” IMBY states on their website .They also state that they will take legal action against those who spread the false information on the internet.Volodymyr Zelenskyj bought the Kehlsteinhaus, which previously belonged to Hitler, writes the media outlet Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland, which is apparently German. But the website hides a secret. Photo: Screenshot.The arrow points towards RussiaAs mentioned, the false story was published by the “German” media outlet Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland, and it is most likely a website created for the purpose of spreading Russian disinformation.CheckDet has not been able to find any traces of the media website from before December 14, 2024. According to various services that monitor changes to websites, the first activity on the website was seen on that very day. It was also on December 14 that the website was first archived through the Wayback Machine service.If you search for the website on Google, there are no results from before December 2024.The website also appears on the list of 100 fake websites that, among others, the German fact-checking media Correctiv has identified as being created with the aim of spreading Russian disinformation ahead of the German elections on February 23, 2025.Correctiv has dubbed the influence operation Storm-1516, and according to the media outlet, the operation has links to the Russian troll factory Internet Research Agency (IRA) and the Russian military intelligence service GRU.The false story also ties in with many other stories about Volodymyr Zelenskyj, which TjekDet has previously fact-checked. Among other things, the president's wife is said to have acquired a Bugatti , and Zelenskyj himself is said to have bought a hotel casino in Cyprus .And the strategy seems to be the same.The Bugatti story was also published on a newly created website that, like Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland, imitates a real news site, where a few fake ones are planted among a sea of true stories - typically with an angle on Russia. Probably to strengthen credibility.Reaction to Trump's dictator accusationThe news outlet AFP writes that false allegations about Volodymyr Zelensky have flared up after US President Donald Trump, among other things, called the Ukrainian president a dictator.We have observed a significant resurgence of anti-Ukrainian disinformation on US social media, much of which appears to be recycled content from previous Russian influence campaigns, McKenzie Sadeghi, an analyst at disinformation watchdog NewsGuard, told AFP .Trump's comments appear to have sparked renewed interest in anti-Ukrainian narratives that had previously faded, Sadeghi further told AFP .Joseph Bodnar, a researcher at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, explains to AFP that the Russian influence attempts focus on creating animosity between the Trump and Zelenskyy administrations.Russia wants to convince American negotiators that Ukraine is their enemy, not their ally. It is a means for the Kremlin to obtain favorable terms in any peace agreement that may come.;Zero-shot;False Claim: Zelensky Did Not Buy Hitler’s Former Summer House, Bavarian Authorities Confirm;Claim being evaluated: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky purchased Adolf Hitler’s former summer house, the Kehlsteinhaus (Eagle’s Nest), for over 100 million kroner, linked to U.S. aid for Ukraine. Key evidence used to assess the claim:  The only source of the story is a dubious German website, Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland, identified as a Russian propaganda outlet created in December 2024 with no prior credibility or history.  The Bavarian state-owned company that owns Kehlsteinhaus (Immobilien Freistaat Bayern, IMBY) denied any sale or plans to sell the property, calling the purchase contract and quotes in the story fabricated.  The website spreading the claim is linked to Russian disinformation campaigns, part of a known operation to undermine Ukraine and Western support.  Similar false stories about Zelensky’s wealth and purchases have appeared before on newly created fake news sites with Russian links.  Experts note these disinformation efforts aim to sow discord and discredit Zelensky amid geopolitical tensions. Verdict: False — The claim that Zelensky bought Hitler’s summer house is a fabrication originating from a Russian disinformation source, with no factual basis or evidence of any such sale.;1. Claim being evaluated: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky purchased Adolf Hitler’s former summer house, the Kehlsteinhaus (Eagle’s Nest), for over 100 million kroner. 2. Verdict: False. 3. Explanation: The claim is based on a fabricated story from a newly created, Russian-linked propaganda website with no credible sources. The Bavarian state company that owns the Kehlsteinhaus has officially denied any sale or plans to sell the property and labeled the purchase documents and quotes as fake. This disinformation aligns with known Russian influence campaigns aiming to discredit Zelensky and Ukraine.;Fact Check: Claim that Zelensky purchased Hitler's 'Eagle's Nest' is False; Zelensky Did Not Purchase Hitler's 'Eagle's Nest' A widely circulated claim on social media platforms, including X and Facebook, alleged that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky purchased Adolf Hitler's former summer residence, Kehlsteinhaus (the Eagle's Nest), for more than 100 million kroner, purportedly linking the acquisition to foreign aid received by Ukraine. Verdict: False. Key Evidence and Findings: The claim, which included fabricated purchase contracts and a video citing a spurious quote from a Bavarian official, originated from a Russian propaganda outlet posing as German media. The investigation revealed the following: 1. Denial of Sale: Immobilien Freistaat Bayern (IMBY), the state-owned Bavarian company that owns Kehlsteinhaus, explicitly denied the sale. IMBY confirmed that the building remains the property of the Free State of Bavaria, stating that no sale has occurred or is planned. They also confirmed the alleged purchase contract and the quote from IMBY management shown in the video are fabricated. 2. Source Identified as Russian Disinformation: The primary source of the story, the website Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland, was found to be a newly created Russian propaganda outlet designed to spread disinformation. German fact-checkers like Correctiv identified it as part of a Russian influence operation (Storm-1516). 3. Context of Disinformation: The false story aligns with a broader pattern of recycled Russian influence campaigns and anti-Ukrainian narratives, particularly those focusing on alleged corruption and luxury purchases by the Ukrainian President and his family.;1. What is the claim being evaluated? The claim being evaluated is that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky purchased Adolf Hitler's former summer house, Kehlsteinhaus (also known as the Eagle's Nest), for more than 100 million kroner. 2. Is the claim true, false, or mixed or other relevant category of verdict? The claim is False. 3. Provide a brief explanation for your decision based on the evidence presented in the fact-check. The fact-check confirms that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky did not purchase Kehlsteinhaus. The property owner, Immobilien Freistaat Bayern (IMBY), explicitly stated that the Kehlsteinhaus remains in the ownership of the Free State of Bavaria, and that a sale has not taken place and is not planned. IMBY also confirmed that the alleged purchase contract and quoted statements regarding the sale shown in the social media posts are fabricated. Furthermore, the fact-check identified the source of the false story, the German media outlet Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland, as a Russian propaganda website created specifically to spread disinformation.;Fact Check: Claim that Zelensky Bought Hitler's Eagle's Nest is False;Claim Being Evaluated: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has purchased Adolf Hitler's old summer house, Kehlsteinhaus (also known as the Eagle's Nest), for more than 100 million kroner. Key Evidence Used: The claim originated from a German media outlet called Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland, which is actually a Russian propaganda outlet. The website was created on December 14, 2024, and lacks credible information. The alleged purchase contract and quote from the Bavarian company Immobilien Freistaat Bayern (IMBY) are fake. IMBY's official website states that Kehlsteinhaus remains in the ownership of the Free State of Bavaria and no sale is planned. Verdict: False. The evidence suggests that the claim is a fabrication spread by Russian propagandists to tarnish President Zelensky's image and create animosity between Ukraine and its allies ¹.;Claim Being Evaluated: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has purchased Adolf Hitler's old summer house, Kehlsteinhaus, also known as the Eagle's Nest, for more than 100 million kroner. Verdict: False. Explanation: The claim is false because the Bavarian company responsible for managing the property, Immobilien Freistaat Bayern (IMBY), denies the sale and labels the alleged purchase contract and quotes as fabrications. Furthermore, the German media outlet that broke the story, Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland, is actually a Russian propaganda outlet created to spread disinformation. This narrative aligns with previous Russian influence campaigns aimed at tarnishing President Zelensky's image and creating animosity between Ukraine and its allies ¹ ².; Zelensky Did Not Buy Hitler’s Eagle’s Nest: False Claim Debunked as Russian Disinformation;Fact-Check Summary Claim Evaluated:Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky purchased Adolf Hitler's former summer house, Kehlsteinhaus (Eagle's Nest), for over 100 million kroner, with the purchase allegedly linked to U.S. aid for Ukraine's war against Russia. Key Evidence:The claim originated from a supposed German media outlet, Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland, identified as a Russian propaganda website created in December 2024, linked to Russian disinformation campaigns (e.g., Storm-1516, tied to the Internet Research Agency and GRU). Immobilien Freistaat Bayern (IMBY), the state-owned Bavarian company that owns Kehlsteinhaus, confirmed the property remains in their ownership, no sale occurred, and the alleged purchase contract and quoted director’s statement are fabricated. No credible German media reported the story, and similar false claims about Zelensky (e.g., his wife buying a Bugatti) follow a pattern of Russian disinformation. The claim aligns with a surge in anti-Ukrainian narratives following remarks by U.S. President Donald Trump, as noted by disinformation analysts from NewsGuard and the Institute for Strategic Dialogue. Verdict:False. The claim is unsupported by credible evidence and stems from a Russian disinformation campaign, with no basis in verified facts.;1. What is the claim being evaluated? The claim is that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky purchased Adolf Hitler's former summer house, Kehlsteinhaus (Eagle's Nest), for more than 100 million kroner, with the purchase allegedly linked to U.S. aid for Ukraine's war against Russia. The claim is supported by posts on X and Facebook, including photos of alleged purchase contracts and a video claiming the sale was made through an Italian company owned by Zelensky, citing a Russian-operated German media outlet, Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland. 2. Is the claim true, false, or mixed or other relevant category of verdict? The claim is false. 3. Brief explanation for the decision based on the evidence presented in the fact-check: The evidence shows that the Kehlsteinhaus remains owned by the Free State of Bavaria, as confirmed by Immobilien Freistaat Bayern (IMBY), which explicitly stated that no sale has occurred or is planned, and the alleged purchase contract and quote from IMBY's director are fabricated. The source of the claim, Aktuelle Nachrichten in Deutschland, is identified as a Russian propaganda outlet linked to disinformation campaigns, with no credible German media corroborating the story. The website's recent creation and ties to Russian influence operations, as noted by Correctiv and NewsGuard, further discredit the claim. Additionally, the pattern of false narratives targeting Zelensky, such as previous debunked claims about his wife’s Bugatti purchase, supports the conclusion that this is part of a broader disinformation effort.
FC_04;Lead;Green trees in February 1722 not proof of climate change;An old newspaper clipping about green trees in the spring of 1722 is making the rounds on social media, but the content doesn't mean what the spreaders seem to think. And the source turns out to be suspiciously similar to another text - which is about Germany.;This is the fact-check :For several years, a newspaper clipping with the headline “In February 1722, all the trees were completely green” has been circulating among climate skeptics on social media. The Source Criticism Agency is investigating the origin of the image – and the truth behind its content.It turns out that the anecdotal article doesn't actually say anything about the climate. And when we dig deeper into the archives, it turns out that large parts of the text aren't even about Swedish conditions – but about the weather in Germany.Post on Facebook with the image April 23, 2024.This is the text in what appears to be a photocopied newspaper article:  In February 1722, all the trees were completely green  . There have certainly been mild winters in the past. Gunnar Carlberg, who is also SMHI's precipitation monitor in Finspång, has looked through old scrapbooks and found the following interesting statistics:  In 1172, the winter was so mild that the trees turned green at the end of January. The birds built their nests and molted in February.  In 1241, the trees were fully leafed out in March.  In 1269, there was no winter at all.  In 1421, the trees bloomed in March and the vines in April, when there were also ripe gooseberries.  In 1538, the trees in the gardens were in full bloom already in December!  In 1585, the corn was in ear at Easter time.  In 1588, the trees turned green in February.  In 1538, 1607, 1617, 1650 and 1659, there was neither snow nor frost.  In 1722, all the trees were green in February.  In 1863, in Skåne, you could pick fully bloomed daisies in February.  NT Wednesday, February 15, 1989 The source criticism agency begins by examining the context in which the image was shared. The first post we find is from 2015 on the blog Klimatupplysningen, which is run by Klimatrealisterna, formerly the Stockholm Initiative. In 2010, the lobby group Stockholm Initiative was named Misleader of the Year by the public education association Vetenskap och Folkbildning . In the book “Upphettning: demokratin i klimatkrisens tid” (published in 2020 by the publisher Fri tanke), the Climate Realists are identified as “the hub of the Swedish denial movement”.  It was on Christmas Eve 2015 that Klimatupplysningen posted the image, stating that it came from a reader. The blog post has 112 comments.Commentary on Klimatupplysningen's blog post 2015.However, it will take five years for the image to truly go viral. Most of the shares we find are from 2020. The newspaper clipping appears on Twitter/X, Facebook and blogs that are skeptical of climate research. The fact that the picture is gaining momentum in the spring of 2020 is probably due to the fact that the spring was warmer and drier than normal that year, according to SMHI's measurements. In the cities of Gothenburg, Nordkoster, Visby and Hoburg, records were broken in the number of hours of sunshine. Weather and climate were on people's lips.But now it's spring again and the latest sharing we can find of the picture is from last week. A man writes on Facebook:It's time to let go of the lies that people's way of life affects the climate... The climate has always varied and this depends, among other things, on the activities of the sun...The post has over 500 interactions on Facebook. “This is something for all our almost religious climate activists to read,” writes one person in the comments section.But is what the post writer claims really true?No, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) writes in its latest report that “human influence, mainly through greenhouse gas emissions, has unequivocally warmed the climate system”. It is also “unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, the ocean and the land”. “The global average temperature has increased faster since 1970 than during any other 50-year period for at least the last 2,000 years.”– According to the UN's climate panel IPCC, the global warming that has occurred since 1980 is mainly caused by anthropogenic greenhouse gases, i.e. the greenhouse gases that humans have added to the atmosphere. But that does not mean that there are also other natural climate variations, explains Sverker Hellström, meteorologist at SMHI.We will return to the science later in the article.The newspaper article from 1989The content of the NT article itself has been quoted by climate skeptics in several editorial media. For example, in articles in the Länstidningen (LT) in Östersund and on the debate page of the newspaper Norra Skånes .But what does the image of the article actually prove? Our review is not going to show much at all.We start with the authenticity of the material. With the naked eye, you can see that the image appears to have been scanned and appears to consist of two parts cut together. A date from the newspaper, “NT Wednesday 5 February 1989” and the news text itself. NT is short for Norrköpings Tidningar, a newspaper founded in 1758 and now Sweden’s oldest daily newspaper still in publication.A number of larger libraries in Sweden have old Swedish newspapers preserved on microfilm.Carolina Rediviva. Photo: Dr. Mirko Junge/Wikimedia commonsAt the Carolina Rediviva University Library in Uppsala, we check to see if an article with the headline In February 1722 all the trees were completely green was published in the NT on February 15, 1989. And yes, it was.On the local pages for Finspång in NT there is the article, also not signed with a name, just like in the viral image. It is therefore some kind of local news article, but the text has an unusually slangy form for newspaper prose. No quotes, just lists of different years.SMHI's “precipitation monitor”The only source reference in the article is to a Gunnar Carlberg who is stated to be a so-called precipitation monitor for SMHI in Finspång. The title is so unusual that the only results we get when we google “precipitation monitor” are back to the NT article from 1989.There are also no notes at SMHI about a Gunnar Carlberg who worked for the authority. However, there is an Inez Carlberg who was a precipitation observer in Finspång in the 80s.– You can imagine that Gunnar was Inez's husband and that they ran the weather station together, muses Sverker Hellström, meteorologist at SMHI.According to the article, Gunnar is said to have “looked through old music albums and found the following interesting statistics.” It may sound like Gunnar did this in his capacity as a member of some role at SMHI, but that is not the case, states Sverker Hellström.Post on Facebook with the newspaper article 2020.A precipitation monitor checks the rain gauge once a day, but the job does not involve any further analysis of the weather and wind – and certainly not going back in time. Gunnar (or someone else) would have collected his clips as a private person, not as an employee of SMHI.– You might get the feeling that the information in the article comes from SMHI, but that is not the case, says Sverker Hellström to Källkritikbyrån.Which clip albums Gunnar Carlberg would have looked at is also not clear from the NT article. The source reference itself is weak to say the least. Clip albums often refer to newspaper clippings, but the oldest Swedish newspaper, Post- och Inrikestidningar, was founded in 1645 – that is, long after several of the years mentioned in the article.Weather measurements started in 1722The NT article itself basically consists of just a list of mild seasons from different seasons. The first weather note dates back to 1172. But in 1172 no weather measurements were made in Sweden.Comment on Facebook March 13.It was also only in the 17th and 18th centuries that humans invented measuring tools for temperature and climate. And the oldest Swedish weather observations in Sweden date back to 1722. They were made at the weather station in Uppsala.– The measurement series began in 1722 and it was professors Anders Celsius and Eric Burman who initiated them, says Erik Sahlée, senior lecturer in meteorology at Uppsala University and responsible for Uppsala University's weather observations.Are these the oldest weather observations in Sweden?– Yes, that's it.But the information that appears in the NT article, can't it be true anyway?– It may be that they are correct. But this is just a snapshot, scattered years. Even if they were correct as individual weather observations, they say nothing about what it looks like over time. A weather station's data for a certain year says nothing about what the climate was like. Here, you jump from year to year and do not describe any longer measurement series, says Erik Sahlée.Search result on Pettersson's blog 2018.The weather notes in the text actually say nothing about the climate, but describe local weather at a certain time. And the question is, are they even about Swedish conditions?From a magazine for American SwedesA private individual conducted his own viral review of the image in January 2020 in a local Facebook group. He believes that the article text comes from a clip from March 2, 1944, from the newspaper Vestkusten, a weekly newspaper for Swedes on the Pacific coast.Comment on Facebook January 5, 2020.According to Wikipedia, Vestkusten is actually a newspaper that existed. It was originally a Swedish-language newspaper that was published in California from 1887 to 2007. The newspaper is preserved in digital form at the California Digital Newspaper Collection .Peace talks, bombing raids and ration cards are some of the topics covered on the newspaper's front page on March 2, 1944. There is still full-scale war in Europe and between the USA and Japan.Vestkusten front page March 2, 1944We search through article by article in the digitized newspaper – and a few pages in we actually find a text that is confusingly similar to that published in the NT.This is what Vestkusten writes:Speaking of the mild winter, Sv. Landsbygden has collected the following rather unusual statistics about mild winters:In 1172 the winter was so mild that the trees turned green at the end of January and the birds built their nests and moulted in February.In 1241 the trees were fully leafed out in March, i.e. six weeks earlier than usual.In 1269 there was no winter at all, the temperature was so warm that the girls in the Rhine region could adorn themselves with violet wreaths at Christmas time.In 1289 there was no winter either and the temperature was as mild as the latter year at the same time. In1421 the trees bloomed in March and the vines in April, when there were also ripe gooseberries.In 1538 the gardens were in full bloom in December.In 1572 the trees already bore leaves in February, just like in 1172.In 1588 the trees were green in February.In 1538, 1607 and 1659 there was neither snow nor frost.In 1601 and 1609 there was no winter in southern Germany.In 1662 the winter was so mild that even in northern Germany people did not light fires in tiled stoves and the trees bloomed in February.In 1722 all the trees were green in February.In 1807 Bore did not come to visit at all.In 1834 the winter was as mild as the last mentioned.In 1863 in Skåne you could pick fully bloomed daisies in February. In 1870 New Year's Day was celebrated in Petersburg at a temperature of eight degrees.From the newspaper Vestkusten, March 2, 1944It is largely the same text that was published in NT 45 years later. But here the reference is to Sv. Landsbygden and not to any rainfall monitor in Finspång. Sv. Landsbygden is probably short for the newspaper Svenska Landsbygden. We have received confirmation from the Royal Library (KB) that the newspaper existed at this time.About German weatherFurthermore, the text in the West Coast is somewhat longer than that in the NT, and several of the dates refer to conditions in Germany.– It is not clear in the NT article that the notes come from any particular place. In 1863 it says about Skåne itself and then we had started our own measurements. But otherwise it does not say where it took place, so it could be in Germany, says Sverker Hellström at SMHI.According to SMHI's records, the average temperature in Skåne in January and February 1863 was plus degrees.– It was certainly experienced as warm then. But if you compare it to today, for example, the average temperature in Lund in 2020 was three degrees warmer than it was in 1863.The information in the form of a submission in Folkbladet 2022 .We cannot say for sure if it is the same text that is reused in the NT, but there is much evidence to suggest so. Both we ourselves and the Google AI service NootbookLM have difficulty finding differences between the texts.It seems as if someone has taken the original text and edited out certain years, as well as all information about Germany. And suddenly a new story about Swedish springs and winters has been created. A story that is not entirely true – and which is now being used to mislead on the internet.Climate change and weatherSo what was it like now, is there a difference between climate and weather?– Yes, there is a difference between climate and weather. I usually make the following analogy: the climate tells you what clothes to bring and the weather tells you what clothes to wear. The climate is what you expect and the weather is what you get. A climate has a natural weather variation and the variations become larger if we look at a smaller area, says Erik Sahlée at Uppsala University.Comment on Facebook March 13.To describe changes in the climate, weather observations from continuous, longer time series and larger geographical areas are needed. These also exist.– If you look up and compile what we have seen across Europe and the world, the warming global trend is not something to discuss. That it is happening as a result of human influence is also not something to discuss. Now we need to start talking about what we should do about climate change instead – and how we can adapt.How do we know that climate change is due to human influence?– Physics shows that. When you just look at how natural factors affect global temperature, you don't get as strong a warming as we have. We humans have created that amplification.Overall: Many have used the image to contradict the idea that humans are behind the global warming that is currently taking place. But according to research, it is people's way of life that has affected the climate.And as for the photographed article itself, it turned out to have made a remarkable journey across media of different times. An article about German weather from the 1940s was remade in the Swedish local press in the 1980s into something that appears to apply to Sweden and that appears to come from a representative of SMHI – to finally spin around as a screenshot on Facebook in the 2020s. ;Vanilla;No, Trees Turning Green in February 1722 Doesn’t Disprove Human-Caused Climate Change;Claim: A viral newspaper clipping claims that “all the trees were completely green” in February 1722, suggesting that current climate change is not unusual or human-caused. Verdict: Misleading. The article is based on anecdotal, mostly German weather observations from the 1940s, not scientific climate data—and its use of a supposed SMHI source is inaccurate.;Verdict: False. The claim that “all the trees were completely green in February 1722” as evidence against human-caused climate change is false. The article cited is based on anecdotal and historically unverifiable weather descriptions—mainly from Germany—and was misrepresented as Swedish data linked to a Swedish meteorological authority. It does not constitute scientific climate evidence and has been used misleadingly in climate denial narratives.;Newspaper Clipping Claiming Ancient Mild Winters to Disprove Climate Change is False;A viral newspaper clipping claiming all the trees were completely green in February 1722 and other mild winters is circulating among climate skeptics. However, a fact-check reveals the article doesn't accurately reflect climate conditions or Swedish history, and much of the content originated from German weather observations published in a 1940s American-Swedish newspaper. The core claim that human lifestyle does not affect climate is false, as scientific consensus confirms human influence is unequivocally warming the climate system.;The verdict for the fact-check is False.;Viral Newspaper Clipping Misleads on Climate Change with Fabricated Weather Claims;A viral newspaper clipping claims that trees were green in February 1722, sparking debate about climate change. However, fact-checking reveals the article's content is misleading and doesn't support the claim that humans aren't behind global warming. The article's origins trace back to a 1944 newspaper piece about German weather, later repurposed for a Swedish audience.;The claim that trees were green in February 1722, as presented in a viral newspaper clipping, is misleading. Here's why ¹: Origin: The article's content originated from a 1944 newspaper piece about German weather, which was later repurposed for a Swedish audience in 1989. Lack of context: The article's text doesn't support the claim about human-induced climate change, and the information presented is more about local weather than climate. Inaccurate representation: The article's source reference to a Gunnar Carlberg, supposedly a precipitation monitor for SMHI, is weak and likely fabricated. Climate vs. weather: The article blurs the line between climate and weather, which are distinct concepts. Given these points, the claim is not entirely false but rather misleading, as it presents partial information out of context to support a specific narrative. This verdict category fits best, as the claim's accuracy depends on interpretation and context, which is lacking in the viral clipping.;Viral Claim of Mild Swedish Winters Disproven: Article Misleads on Climate Change;A viral newspaper clipping from 1989, claiming mild winters in Sweden dating back to 1172, has been widely shared by climate skeptics to downplay human-driven climate change. Fact-checking reveals the article is misleading, with much of its content originating from a 1944 report about German weather, not Swedish conditions, and it does not disprove the well-established science of human-induced global warming.;The verdict for the fact-check is false. The claim that the newspaper clipping about mild winters in Sweden, dating back to 1172, disproves human-driven climate change is misleading. The article's content largely originates from a 1944 report about German weather, not Swedish conditions, and it does not undermine the well-established scientific evidence that human activities, primarily greenhouse gas emissions, are the main cause of recent global warming.

In 1421, the trees bloomed in March and the vines in April, when there were also ripe gooseberries.  In 1538, the trees in the gardens were in full bloom already in December!  In 1585, the corn was in ear at Easter time.  In 1588, the trees turned green in February.  In 1538, 1607, 1617, 1650 and 1659, there was neither snow nor frost.  In 1722, all the trees were green in February.  In 1863, in Skåne, you could pick fully bloomed daisies in February.

In the book “Upphettning: demokratin i klimatkrisens tid” (published in 2020 by the publisher Fri tanke), the Climate Realists are identified as “the hub of the Swedish denial movement”.

The newspaper clipping appears on Twitter/X, Facebook and blogs that are skeptical of climate research. The fact that the picture is gaining momentum in the spring of 2020 is probably due to the fact that the spring was warmer and drier than normal that year, according to SMHI's measurements. In the cities of Gothenburg, Nordkoster, Visby and Hoburg, records were broken in the number of hours of sunshine.

And the oldest Swedish weather observations in Sweden date back to 1722. They were made at the weather station in Uppsala.– The measurement series began in 1722 and it was professors Anders Celsius and Eric Burman who initiated them, says Erik Sahlée, senior lecturer in meteorology at Uppsala University and responsible for Uppsala University's weather observations.Are these the oldest weather observations in Sweden?– Yes, that's it.But the information that appears in the NT article, can't it be true anyway?– It may be that they are correct. But this is just a snapshot, scattered years. Even if they were correct as individual weather observations, they say nothing about what it looks like over time. A weather station's data for a certain year says nothing about what the climate was like. Here, you jump from year to year and do not describe any longer measurement series, says Erik Sahlée.Search result on Pettersson's blog 2018.The weather notes in the text actually say nothing about the climate, but describe local weather at a certain time. And the question is, are they even about Swedish conditions?From a magazine for American SwedesA private individual conducted his own viral review of the image in January 2020 in a local Facebook group. He believes that the article text comes from a clip from March 2, 1944, from the newspaper Vestkusten, a weekly newspaper for Swedes on the Pacific coast.Comment on Facebook January 5, 2020.According to Wikipedia, Vestkusten is actually a newspaper that existed. It was originally a Swedish-language newspaper that was published in California from 1887 to 2007. The newspaper is preserved in digital form at the California Digital Newspaper Collection .Peace talks, bombing raids and ration cards are some of the topics covered on the newspaper's front page on March 2, 1944. There is still full-scale war in Europe and between the USA and Japan.Vestkusten front page March 2, 1944We search through article by article in the digitized newspaper – and a few pages in we actually find a text that is confusingly similar to that published in the NT.This is what Vestkusten writes:Speaking of the mild winter, Sv. Landsbygden has collected the following rather unusual statistics about mild winters:In 1172 the winter was so mild that the trees turned green at the end of January and the birds built their nests and moulted in February.In 1241 the trees were fully leafed out in March, i.e. six weeks earlier than usual.In 1269 there was no winter at all, the temperature was so warm that the girls in the Rhine region could adorn themselves with violet wreaths at Christmas time.In 1289 there was no winter either and the temperature was as mild as the latter year at the same time. In1421 the trees bloomed in March and the vines in April, when there were also ripe gooseberries.In 1538 the gardens were in full bloom in December.In 1572 the trees already bore leaves in February, just like in 1172.In 1588 the trees were green in February.In 1538, 1607 and 1659 there was neither snow nor frost.In 1601 and 1609 there was no winter in southern Germany.In 1662 the winter was so mild that even in northern Germany people did not light fires in tiled stoves and the trees bloomed in February.In 1722 all the trees were green in February.In 1807 Bore did not come to visit at all.In 1834 the winter was as mild as the last mentioned.In 1863 in Skåne you could pick fully bloomed daisies in February. In 1870 New Year's Day was celebrated in Petersburg at a temperature of eight degrees.From the newspaper Vestkusten, March 2, 1944It is largely the same text that was published in NT 45 years later. But here the reference is to Sv. Landsbygden and not to any rainfall monitor in Finspång. Sv. Landsbygden is probably short for the newspaper Svenska Landsbygden. We have received confirmation from the Royal Library (KB) that the newspaper existed at this time.About German weatherFurthermore, the text in the West Coast is somewhat longer than that in the NT, and several of the dates refer to conditions in Germany.– It is not clear in the NT article that the notes come from any particular place. In 1863 it says about Skåne itself and then we had started our own measurements. But otherwise it does not say where it took place, so it could be in Germany, says Sverker Hellström at SMHI.According to SMHI's records, the average temperature in Skåne in January and February 1863 was plus degrees.– It was certainly experienced as warm then. But if you compare it to today, for example, the average temperature in Lund in 2020 was three degrees warmer than it was in 1863.The information in the form of a submission in Folkbladet 2022 .We cannot say for sure if it is the same text that is reused in the NT, but there is much evidence to suggest so. Both we ourselves and the Google AI service NootbookLM have difficulty finding differences between the texts.It seems as if someone has taken the original text and edited out certain years, as well as all information about Germany. And suddenly a new story about Swedish springs and winters has been created. A story that is not entirely true – and which is now being used to mislead on the internet.Climate change and weatherSo what was it like now, is there a difference between climate and weather?– Yes, there is a difference between climate and weather. I usually make the following analogy: the climate tells you what clothes to bring and the weather tells you what clothes to wear. The climate is what you expect and the weather is what you get. A climate has a natural weather variation and the variations become larger if we look at a smaller area, says Erik Sahlée at Uppsala University.Comment on Facebook March 13.To describe changes in the climate, weather observations from continuous, longer time series and larger geographical areas are needed. These also exist.– If you look up and compile what we have seen across Europe and the world, the warming global trend is not something to discuss. That it is happening as a result of human influence is also not something to discuss. Now we need to start talking about what we should do about climate change instead – and how we can adapt.How do we know that climate change is due to human influence?– Physics shows that. When you just look at how natural factors affect global temperature, you don't get as strong a warming as we have. We humans have created that amplification.Overall: Many have used the image to contradict the idea that humans are behind the global warming that is currently taking place. But according to research, it is people's way of life that has affected the climate.And as for the photographed article itself, it turned out to have made a remarkable journey across media of different times. An article about German weather from the 1940s was remade in the Swedish local press in the 1980s into something that appears to apply to Sweden and that appears to come from a representative of SMHI – to finally spin around as a screenshot on Facebook in the 2020s. ;Ask-me-anything;No, Trees Weren’t Green in February 1722—Viral Clipping Misrepresents Historical Weather and Climate Science;A viral newspaper clipping often cited by climate skeptics claims that Swedish trees were fully green in February 1722—proof, they say, that extreme weather is nothing new. But a closer look reveals the story is based on anecdotal and misattributed sources—mainly old reports from Germany—making the claim misleading and irrelevant to today’s climate science.;1. What is the claim being verified? That a newspaper clipping stating “In February 1722, all the trees were completely green” is credible evidence that extreme weather events—such as unusually warm winters—occurred long before modern climate change, thereby casting doubt on the role of human activity in today’s global warming. 2. What is the final verdict? False. 3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict?  The clipping originated from a local Swedish newspaper in 1989 (NT – Norrköpings Tidningar), but the content appears to be a reworked version of a 1944 article from the U.S.-based Swedish-language paper Vestkusten, which mostly referred to historical weather anecdotes from Germany—not Sweden.  The article attributes the information to a “precipitation monitor” at SMHI, but no such official role existed, and there is no record of the named person working for the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute.  Many of the weather claims predate any formal weather observation systems in Sweden, which only began in 1722, making them unverifiable.  The claims are isolated anecdotes rather than part of a consistent, scientific climate record and therefore cannot be used to make conclusions about historical climate trends.  Experts confirm that while natural climate variation exists, the current trend of global warming—especially since 1980—is clearly linked to human-caused greenhouse gas emissions, as shown by long-term scientific measurements and consensus among climate researchers.;False: Viral Green Trees in February 1722 Clipping Misleads on Climate History;A circulating newspaper clipping, claiming that In February 1722, all the trees were completely green and presenting a list of historical mild winters, has been used by climate skeptics to argue against human-caused climate change. This claim is false. The article's content is largely an unreliable anecdote, with significant portions referring to German weather, not Swedish conditions, and the original source has been misrepresented to appear as an official Swedish meteorological report.;Here's the verdict of the fact-check: 1. What is the claim being verified? The claim being verified is that a newspaper clipping stating In February 1722, all the trees were completely green and listing other historical mild winters proves that the climate has always varied significantly due to natural factors, thereby contradicting the idea that human activity is causing current global warming. 2. What is the final verdict? False. 3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict?  Misleading Origin and Attribution: The newspaper clipping from Norrköpings Tidningar (NT) in 1989, which is widely circulated, is largely a re-edited version of an older article from a 1944 Swedish-American newspaper called Vestkusten. The Vestkusten article itself sourced its information from another publication, likely Svenska Landsbygden.  Fabricated Source (in NT article): The NT article attributes the statistics to a Gunnar Carlberg, described as an SMHI's precipitation monitor. However, SMHI (the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute) has no record of a Gunnar Carlberg working in that capacity, and the job of a precipitation monitor does not involve historical climate analysis. This suggests a deliberate misrepresentation of the source to lend authority to the claims.  Irrelevant to Climate Change: The historical anecdotes, even if individually accurate, are isolated weather observations, not long-term climate data. Climate science requires continuous, longer time series and broader geographical areas to describe changes. These isolated snapshots do not provide evidence about long-term climate trends or variations.  Geographical Misdirection: A significant portion of the original 1944 text (and by extension, the 1989 NT article) refers to weather conditions in Germany, not Sweden. The 1989 NT article omits these geographical references, making it appear as if the information pertains entirely to Sweden, which is misleading.  Scientific Consensus on Human Influence: The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) unequivocally states that human influence, mainly through greenhouse gas emissions, has unequivocally warmed the climate system. Global average temperatures have increased faster since 1970 than in any other 50-year period for at least the last 2,000 years, and this warming is primarily attributed to anthropogenic greenhouse gases. While natural climate variations exist, they do not explain the rapid warming observed since 1980.  Lack of Early Measurement Data: Many of the historical dates cited (e.g., 1172, 1241) predate the invention of modern weather measuring tools and the oldest systematic weather observations in Sweden, which began in Uppsala in 1722. This further undermines the scientific validity of the statistics.;Viral Claim About Green Trees in 1722 Debunked: Fact-Check Reveals Misleading Climate Change Narrative;A viral newspaper clipping claims that in February 1722, all trees were completely green, sparking debates about climate change. However, a closer look reveals that the article's origins are dubious and its content has been misused to mislead the public. Let's dive into the facts behind this claim. Based on the investigation: Claim being verified: The claim that trees were green in February 1722, used to question human influence on climate change. Final verdict: False. The article's content doesn't support the claim about climate change, and its origins are likely from a 1944 newspaper article about German weather, not Swedish conditions. Introduction: The lead aims to concisely introduce the claim, highlight the investigation's findings, and set the stage for the fact-check article's detailed analysis ¹.;Fact-Check Verdict 1. Claim Being Verified The claim being verified is that trees were completely green in February 1722, used to question human influence on climate change. 2. Final Verdict False. The article's content doesn't support the claim about climate change, and its origins are likely from a 1944 newspaper article about German weather, not Swedish conditions. 3. Evidence Supporting the Verdict Several pieces of evidence support this verdict: Origin of the Article: The viral newspaper clipping is likely a remade version of an article from the 1944 newspaper Vestkusten, which discussed mild winters in Germany, not Sweden. Lack of Credible Sources: The NT article from 1989 cites Gunnar Carlberg, a supposed precipitation monitor for SMHI in Finspång, but SMHI has no records of such a person working in that role. Inconsistent Content: The article's content is a list of mild seasons from different years, but the measurements and observations lack credible sources and context, making it unreliable for drawing conclusions about climate change. Expert Opinions: Meteorologists at SMHI and Uppsala University confirm that the article's content doesn't provide evidence about long-term climate trends or human influence on climate change ¹.;Viral Claim of Historical Mild Winters Proving Natural Climate Change Debunked as Misleading;A viral newspaper clipping from 1989, claiming mild winters in Sweden dating back to 1172, has been used by climate skeptics to argue that current global warming is not human-driven. Investigations reveal the article, originally about German weather, was misrepresented and lacks credible climate data, rendering the claim misleading. This fact-check unravels the origins and inaccuracies of the widely shared image.;1. What is the claim being verified? The claim being verified is that a newspaper clipping from 1989, citing historical mild winters in Sweden (e.g., In February 1722, all the trees were completely green), suggests that current global warming is not driven by human activity but is instead part of natural climate variations, as used by climate skeptics on social media. 2. What is the final verdict? The verdict is misleading. 3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict? - Misrepresentation of Source and Context: The newspaper article from Norrköpings Tidningar (NT) in 1989, attributed to Gunnar Carlberg, was found to be a repurposed version of a 1944 article from Vestkusten, a Swedish-American newspaper. The original text primarily described weather conditions in Germany, not Sweden, but references to Germany were omitted in the NT article, creating a false impression of Swedish climate data. - Lack of Credible Source: The article cites Gunnar Carlberg as an SMHI precipitation monitor, but SMHI has no record of him, and the role does not involve historical climate analysis. The source of the historical weather claims, referred to as old scrapbooks, is vague and unverifiable, especially for dates like 1172, when no systematic weather records existed in Sweden. - Historical Inaccuracy: Regular weather measurements in Sweden began in 1722, making claims about earlier years (e.g., 1172, 1241) speculative and unverified. The article’s list of mild winters represents isolated weather events, not climate trends, and cannot be used to draw conclusions about long-term climate patterns. - Scientific Consensus Contradicts the Claim: The IPCC’s reports confirm that human-induced greenhouse gas emissions are the primary driver of global warming since 1970, with global temperatures rising faster than at any point in the last 2,000 years. While natural climate variations exist, they do not account for the current warming trend, as supported by meteorological experts like Sverker Hellström and Erik Sahlée. - Intent to Mislead: The article has been shared by climate skeptic groups, such as Klimatrealisterna, to argue against human-driven climate change. The selective editing of the original text and its use to imply natural climate variability undermines established climate science, making the claim misleading.

Landsbygden has collected the following rather unusual statistics about mild winters:In 1172 the winter was so mild that the trees turned green at the end of January and the birds built their nests and moulted in February.In 1241 the trees were fully leafed out in March, i.e. six weeks earlier than usual.In 1269 there was no winter at all, the temperature was so warm that the girls in the Rhine region could adorn themselves with violet wreaths at Christmas time.In 1289 there was no winter either and the temperature was as mild as the latter year at the same time. In1421 the trees bloomed in March and the vines in April, when there were also ripe gooseberries.In 1538 the gardens were in full bloom in December.In 1572 the trees already bore leaves in February, just like in 1172.In 1588 the trees were green in February.In 1538, 1607 and 1659 there was neither snow nor frost.In 1601 and 1609 there was no winter in southern Germany.In 1662 the winter was so mild that even in northern Germany people did not light fires in tiled stoves and the trees bloomed in February.In 1722 all the trees were green in February.In 1807 Bore did not come to visit at all.In 1834 the winter was as mild as the last mentioned.In 1863 in Skåne you could pick fully bloomed daisies in February. In 1870 New Year's Day was celebrated in Petersburg at a temperature of eight degrees.From the newspaper Vestkusten, March 2, 1944It is largely the same text that was published in NT 45 years later. But here the reference is to Sv. Landsbygden and not to any rainfall monitor in Finspång. Sv. Landsbygden is probably short for the newspaper Svenska Landsbygden. We have received confirmation from the Royal Library (KB) that the newspaper existed at this time.About German weatherFurthermore, the text in the West Coast is somewhat longer than that in the NT, and several of the dates refer to conditions in Germany.– It is not clear in the NT article that the notes come from any particular place. In 1863 it says about Skåne itself and then we had started our own measurements. But otherwise it does not say where it took place, so it could be in Germany, says Sverker Hellström at SMHI.According to SMHI's records, the average temperature in Skåne in January and February 1863 was plus degrees.– It was certainly experienced as warm then. But if you compare it to today, for example, the average temperature in Lund in 2020 was three degrees warmer than it was in 1863.The information in the form of a submission in Folkbladet 2022 .We cannot say for sure if it is the same text that is reused in the NT, but there is much evidence to suggest so. Both we ourselves and the Google AI service NootbookLM have difficulty finding differences between the texts.It seems as if someone has taken the original text and edited out certain years, as well as all information about Germany. And suddenly a new story about Swedish springs and winters has been created. A story that is not entirely true – and which is now being used to mislead on the internet.Climate change and weatherSo what was it like now, is there a difference between climate and weather?– Yes, there is a difference between climate and weather. I usually make the following analogy: the climate tells you what clothes to bring and the weather tells you what clothes to wear. The climate is what you expect and the weather is what you get. A climate has a natural weather variation and the variations become larger if we look at a smaller area, says Erik Sahlée at Uppsala University.Comment on Facebook March 13.To describe changes in the climate, weather observations from continuous, longer time series and larger geographical areas are needed. These also exist.– If you look up and compile what we have seen across Europe and the world, the warming global trend is not something to discuss. That it is happening as a result of human influence is also not something to discuss. Now we need to start talking about what we should do about climate change instead – and how we can adapt.How do we know that climate change is due to human influence?– Physics shows that. When you just look at how natural factors affect global temperature, you don't get as strong a warming as we have. We humans have created that amplification.Overall: Many have used the image to contradict the idea that humans are behind the global warming that is currently taking place. But according to research, it is people's way of life that has affected the climate.And as for the photographed article itself, it turned out to have made a remarkable journey across media of different times. An article about German weather from the 1940s was remade in the Swedish local press in the 1980s into something that appears to apply to Sweden and that appears to come from a representative of SMHI – to finally spin around as a screenshot on Facebook in the 2020s. ;Chain-of-Thought;Claim that 1722 Mild Winter Disproves Human-Caused Climate Change Is False, Experts Confirm;A viral newspaper clipping claims that trees were unusually green in February 1722, suggesting historically mild winters and questioning human-driven climate change. However, this article is misleading—its origins trace back to a 1944 American-Swedish publication about German weather, later repurposed in Swedish media, and it does not provide evidence against current climate science. Experts confirm that while natural variations occur, the overwhelming scientific consensus attributes recent global warming primarily to human activities.;1. Claim being evaluated: That historical accounts showing unusually green trees and mild winters in the past (such as February 1722) prove that climate variations are natural and therefore human activities do not significantly affect current global warming. 2. Verdict: False (misleading). 3. Justification:  The newspaper clipping originates from a 1944 article about German weather, not Swedish conditions, and was later republished in a modified form in Sweden, removing key geographic context.  The source cited in the clipping is weak and unverifiable, and the weather notes describe isolated weather events, not long-term climate trends.  Systematic weather measurements in Sweden only began in 1722, so earlier claims cannot be verified scientifically.  Experts confirm that isolated warm winters do not disprove ongoing climate change.  The UN IPCC and scientific consensus show that recent rapid warming is mainly caused by human greenhouse gas emissions, beyond natural variability.;1722 Green Trees Claim Debunked: Viral Climate Skeptic Article Misrepresents German Weather and Misleads on Climate Change;A newspaper clipping claiming In February 1722, all the trees were completely green, circulated by climate skeptics to dispute human-caused climate change, has been found to be misleading. The anecdotal text, originally from a 1944 Swedish-American newspaper and largely about German weather, was misrepresented in a 1989 Swedish local newspaper and is now used inaccurately to deny anthropogenic global warming.;1. Claim Being Evaluated: The core claim being evaluated is that a newspaper clipping stating In February 1722, all the trees were completely green (along with other historical anecdotes about mild winters) proves that climate variation is natural and thus negates the idea that human activity causes global warming. 2. Verdict: False. 3. Justification: The claim is false for several key reasons:  Misrepresentation of Source and Context: The article, widely circulated by climate skeptics, is a photocopied clipping from a 1989 Swedish local newspaper (Norrköpings Tidningar - NT). However, the fact-check reveals this NT article is largely a re-edited version of an older text from a 1944 Swedish-American newspaper called Vestkusten. Crucially, the Vestkusten article itself credits Sv. Landsbygden and includes numerous references to weather conditions in Germany, not exclusively Sweden. The NT article omits these geographical specifics, making it appear as if the events apply broadly or to Sweden, which is misleading.  Misleading Attribution to SMHI: The NT article falsely attributes the statistics to a Gunnar Carlberg, described as an SMHI's precipitation monitor in Finspång. SMHI (Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute) has no record of a Gunnar Carlberg working in such a capacity, and a precipitation monitor's job does not involve historical climate analysis. This creates a false impression that the information is officially endorsed or scientifically validated by SMHI.  Anecdotal Evidence vs. Climate Data: The historical notes in the clipping are isolated, anecdotal observations of specific mild weather events (snapshots, scattered years). They do not constitute continuous, long-term weather measurements necessary to understand climate trends. Swedish weather observations only began in 1722 in Uppsala, meaning earlier dates mentioned (e.g., 1172, 1241) could not be based on systematic measurements from Sweden.  Distinction Between Weather and Climate: Meteorologists and climate scientists explicitly state that these anecdotes describe weather (local conditions at a specific time) and not climate (long-term patterns). Isolated warm winters do not negate the overall trend of global warming.  Scientific Consensus on Anthropogenic Climate Change: The fact-check explicitly references the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), stating that human influence, mainly through greenhouse gas emissions, has unequivocally warmed the climate system. This directly contradicts the climate skeptics' underlying claim that human activity does not affect the climate.;Viral Newspaper Clipping Falsely Claims Sweden's Mild Winters Prove Climate Change Isn't Caused by Humans;A viral newspaper clipping claims Sweden experienced unusually mild winters in various years, including 1722 when all the trees were completely green in February. However, fact-checking reveals the article's content doesn't support the claim about climate, and much of the information actually pertains to Germany, not Sweden. The image is being misused to contradict human influence on global warming, despite research confirming human activities are the primary cause of current climate change.;Fact-Check Verdict 1. Claim Being Evaluated The claim being evaluated is that a viral newspaper clipping proves Sweden experienced unusually mild winters in various years, including 1722 when all the trees were completely green in February, and that this contradicts human influence on global warming. 2. Verdict The verdict is False. 3. Justification The decision is justified based on the following key evidence ¹ ² ³: Origin of the Article: The viral newspaper clipping originated from a 1944 article in the Vestkusten newspaper, which discussed mild winters in Germany, not Sweden. The article was later remade and published in a Swedish local newspaper in 1989, omitting references to Germany. Lack of Credible Sources: The article's source, Gunnar Carlberg, claimed to be a precipitation monitor for SMHI (Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute), but there is no record of such a person working at SMHI. It's possible that Gunnar was Inez Carlberg's husband, and they ran a weather station together. Climate vs. Weather: The article's content describes local weather events rather than long-term climate trends. Climate scientists emphasize that a single weather event or anecdotal evidence cannot be used to disprove human influence on global warming. Human Influence on Climate Change: According to research, human activities, particularly greenhouse gas emissions, have unequivocally warmed the climate system. Natural climate variations do exist, but they do not contradict the overwhelming evidence of human-caused climate change. These points demonstrate that the claim is false and has been misused to mislead people about climate change.;Viral Claim of Mild Swedish Winters Proving No Human-Driven Climate Change Debunked as False;A viral newspaper clipping claiming mild winters in Sweden, like trees turning green in February 1722, has been used by climate skeptics to downplay human-driven climate change, but investigations reveal the article is misleading, with much of its content originating from 1940s reports about German weather, not Sweden. The Source Criticism Agency's review finds the claims largely false, as the article misrepresents historical weather data and lacks context for climate trends. This fact-check explores the origins and inaccuracies of the clipping, highlighting the distinction between weather and climate.;1. Claim Being Evaluated: The claim is that a newspaper clipping, citing mild winters in Sweden (e.g., In February 1722, all the trees were completely green), provides evidence that historical weather patterns contradict the idea of human-driven climate change, suggesting climate variations are natural and primarily influenced by factors like solar activity. 2. Verdict: The verdict is false. The clipping does not provide credible evidence to support the claim that historical weather patterns negate human-driven climate change. 3. Justification Based on Key Supporting Evidence: - Misrepresentation of Source and Context: The newspaper article, published in Norrköpings Tidningar (NT) on February 15, 1989, is largely derived from a 1944 article in Vestkusten, a Swedish-American newspaper. The original text refers to weather conditions primarily in Germany, not Sweden, but the NT version omits this, creating a misleading impression that the events occurred in Sweden. - Lack of Credible Historical Data: The article lists weather events from as early as 1172, but systematic weather measurements in Sweden began only in 1722. Earlier claims (e.g., 1172, 1241, 1269) lack verifiable records and are likely anecdotal, rendering them unreliable for climate analysis. - Confusion of Weather and Climate: The clipping describes isolated weather events, not long-term climate trends. Experts like Erik Sahlée emphasize that single-year observations do not reflect climate, which requires continuous data over larger areas and time periods. The UN IPCC confirms human-driven warming, with global temperatures rising faster since 1970 than in any 50-year period in the last 2,000 years. - Unreliable Source Attribution: The NT article cites Gunnar Carlberg, described as an SMHI precipitation monitor, but SMHI has no record of him, and the role of precipitation monitor does not involve historical weather analysis. The source of the data, referred to as old scrapbooks, is vague and lacks credibility. - Manipulation of Narrative: The omission of German references in the NT article and its use by climate skeptics to argue against human-driven climate change indicate intentional or unintentional misrepresentation. The IPCC and meteorologists like Sverker Hellström confirm that while natural climate variations exist, human greenhouse gas emissions are the primary driver of recent global warming. The clipping’s misuse of historical weather anecdotes, lack of credible sourcing, and failure to distinguish weather from climate make the claim false in the context of challenging human-driven climate change.
FC_04;Lead;Green trees in February 1722 not proof of climate change;An old newspaper clipping about green trees in the spring of 1722 is making the rounds on social media, but the content doesn't mean what the spreaders seem to think. And the source turns out to be suspiciously similar to another text - which is about Germany.;This is the fact-check :For several years, a newspaper clipping with the headline “In February 1722, all the trees were completely green” has been circulating among climate skeptics on social media. The Source Criticism Agency is investigating the origin of the image – and the truth behind its content.It turns out that the anecdotal article doesn't actually say anything about the climate. And when we dig deeper into the archives, it turns out that large parts of the text aren't even about Swedish conditions – but about the weather in Germany.Post on Facebook with the image April 23, 2024.This is the text in what appears to be a photocopied newspaper article:  In February 1722, all the trees were completely green  . There have certainly been mild winters in the past. Gunnar Carlberg, who is also SMHI's precipitation monitor in Finspång, has looked through old scrapbooks and found the following interesting statistics:  In 1172, the winter was so mild that the trees turned green at the end of January. The birds built their nests and molted in February.  In 1241, the trees were fully leafed out in March.  In 1269, there was no winter at all.  In 1421, the trees bloomed in March and the vines in April, when there were also ripe gooseberries.  In 1538, the trees in the gardens were in full bloom already in December!  In 1585, the corn was in ear at Easter time.  In 1588, the trees turned green in February.  In 1538, 1607, 1617, 1650 and 1659, there was neither snow nor frost.  In 1722, all the trees were green in February.  In 1863, in Skåne, you could pick fully bloomed daisies in February.  NT Wednesday, February 15, 1989 The source criticism agency begins by examining the context in which the image was shared. The first post we find is from 2015 on the blog Klimatupplysningen, which is run by Klimatrealisterna, formerly the Stockholm Initiative. In 2010, the lobby group Stockholm Initiative was named Misleader of the Year by the public education association Vetenskap och Folkbildning . In the book “Upphettning: demokratin i klimatkrisens tid” (published in 2020 by the publisher Fri tanke), the Climate Realists are identified as “the hub of the Swedish denial movement”.  It was on Christmas Eve 2015 that Klimatupplysningen posted the image, stating that it came from a reader. The blog post has 112 comments.Commentary on Klimatupplysningen's blog post 2015.However, it will take five years for the image to truly go viral. Most of the shares we find are from 2020. The newspaper clipping appears on Twitter/X, Facebook and blogs that are skeptical of climate research. The fact that the picture is gaining momentum in the spring of 2020 is probably due to the fact that the spring was warmer and drier than normal that year, according to SMHI's measurements. In the cities of Gothenburg, Nordkoster, Visby and Hoburg, records were broken in the number of hours of sunshine. Weather and climate were on people's lips.But now it's spring again and the latest sharing we can find of the picture is from last week. A man writes on Facebook:It's time to let go of the lies that people's way of life affects the climate... The climate has always varied and this depends, among other things, on the activities of the sun...The post has over 500 interactions on Facebook. “This is something for all our almost religious climate activists to read,” writes one person in the comments section.But is what the post writer claims really true?No, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) writes in its latest report that “human influence, mainly through greenhouse gas emissions, has unequivocally warmed the climate system”. It is also “unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, the ocean and the land”. “The global average temperature has increased faster since 1970 than during any other 50-year period for at least the last 2,000 years.”– According to the UN's climate panel IPCC, the global warming that has occurred since 1980 is mainly caused by anthropogenic greenhouse gases, i.e. the greenhouse gases that humans have added to the atmosphere. But that does not mean that there are also other natural climate variations, explains Sverker Hellström, meteorologist at SMHI.We will return to the science later in the article.The newspaper article from 1989The content of the NT article itself has been quoted by climate skeptics in several editorial media. For example, in articles in the Länstidningen (LT) in Östersund and on the debate page of the newspaper Norra Skånes .But what does the image of the article actually prove? Our review is not going to show much at all.We start with the authenticity of the material. With the naked eye, you can see that the image appears to have been scanned and appears to consist of two parts cut together. A date from the newspaper, “NT Wednesday 5 February 1989” and the news text itself. NT is short for Norrköpings Tidningar, a newspaper founded in 1758 and now Sweden’s oldest daily newspaper still in publication.A number of larger libraries in Sweden have old Swedish newspapers preserved on microfilm.Carolina Rediviva. Photo: Dr. Mirko Junge/Wikimedia commonsAt the Carolina Rediviva University Library in Uppsala, we check to see if an article with the headline In February 1722 all the trees were completely green was published in the NT on February 15, 1989. And yes, it was.On the local pages for Finspång in NT there is the article, also not signed with a name, just like in the viral image. It is therefore some kind of local news article, but the text has an unusually slangy form for newspaper prose. No quotes, just lists of different years.SMHI's “precipitation monitor”The only source reference in the article is to a Gunnar Carlberg who is stated to be a so-called precipitation monitor for SMHI in Finspång. The title is so unusual that the only results we get when we google “precipitation monitor” are back to the NT article from 1989.There are also no notes at SMHI about a Gunnar Carlberg who worked for the authority. However, there is an Inez Carlberg who was a precipitation observer in Finspång in the 80s.– You can imagine that Gunnar was Inez's husband and that they ran the weather station together, muses Sverker Hellström, meteorologist at SMHI.According to the article, Gunnar is said to have “looked through old music albums and found the following interesting statistics.” It may sound like Gunnar did this in his capacity as a member of some role at SMHI, but that is not the case, states Sverker Hellström.Post on Facebook with the newspaper article 2020.A precipitation monitor checks the rain gauge once a day, but the job does not involve any further analysis of the weather and wind – and certainly not going back in time. Gunnar (or someone else) would have collected his clips as a private person, not as an employee of SMHI.– You might get the feeling that the information in the article comes from SMHI, but that is not the case, says Sverker Hellström to Källkritikbyrån.Which clip albums Gunnar Carlberg would have looked at is also not clear from the NT article. The source reference itself is weak to say the least. Clip albums often refer to newspaper clippings, but the oldest Swedish newspaper, Post- och Inrikestidningar, was founded in 1645 – that is, long after several of the years mentioned in the article.Weather measurements started in 1722The NT article itself basically consists of just a list of mild seasons from different seasons. The first weather note dates back to 1172. But in 1172 no weather measurements were made in Sweden.Comment on Facebook March 13.It was also only in the 17th and 18th centuries that humans invented measuring tools for temperature and climate. And the oldest Swedish weather observations in Sweden date back to 1722. They were made at the weather station in Uppsala.– The measurement series began in 1722 and it was professors Anders Celsius and Eric Burman who initiated them, says Erik Sahlée, senior lecturer in meteorology at Uppsala University and responsible for Uppsala University's weather observations.Are these the oldest weather observations in Sweden?– Yes, that's it.But the information that appears in the NT article, can't it be true anyway?– It may be that they are correct. But this is just a snapshot, scattered years. Even if they were correct as individual weather observations, they say nothing about what it looks like over time. A weather station's data for a certain year says nothing about what the climate was like. Here, you jump from year to year and do not describe any longer measurement series, says Erik Sahlée.Search result on Pettersson's blog 2018.The weather notes in the text actually say nothing about the climate, but describe local weather at a certain time. And the question is, are they even about Swedish conditions?From a magazine for American SwedesA private individual conducted his own viral review of the image in January 2020 in a local Facebook group. He believes that the article text comes from a clip from March 2, 1944, from the newspaper Vestkusten, a weekly newspaper for Swedes on the Pacific coast.Comment on Facebook January 5, 2020.According to Wikipedia, Vestkusten is actually a newspaper that existed. It was originally a Swedish-language newspaper that was published in California from 1887 to 2007. The newspaper is preserved in digital form at the California Digital Newspaper Collection .Peace talks, bombing raids and ration cards are some of the topics covered on the newspaper's front page on March 2, 1944. There is still full-scale war in Europe and between the USA and Japan.Vestkusten front page March 2, 1944We search through article by article in the digitized newspaper – and a few pages in we actually find a text that is confusingly similar to that published in the NT.This is what Vestkusten writes:Speaking of the mild winter, Sv.

However, the article’s original text mostly refers to weather in Germany, not Sweden, and does not provide reliable evidence against current climate science. Scientific consensus confirms that recent global warming is unequivocally driven by human activity.;1. Claim being assessed: The claim is that historical newspaper reports showing unusually mild winters—such as “in February 1722, all the trees were completely green”—prove that climate has always varied naturally, thus undermining the idea that current global warming is caused by human activities. 2. Verdict: False. 3. Reasoning and evidence:  The original newspaper article was found to be a reworked version of a 1944 American-Swedish newspaper text primarily describing weather conditions in Germany, not Sweden.  The article’s data are anecdotal weather snapshots, not systematic climate records, and cannot be used to draw conclusions about long-term climate trends.  The source attributed (a “precipitation monitor” at SMHI) is misleading, and the article was not an official SMHI publication.  Scientific climate data and consensus, including from the UN IPCC, show unequivocally that recent global warming is primarily caused by human greenhouse gas emissions.  Isolated historical warm spells do not contradict the broader, well-documented trend of anthropogenic climate change.;Newspaper Clipping Claiming 1722 Green Trees Debunks Climate Change: False;A newspaper clipping circulating among climate skeptics, claiming In February 1722, all the trees were completely green to dispute human-caused climate change, is misleading. Investigations reveal the article, originally published in a Swedish newspaper in 1989, is largely based on weather anecdotes from Germany from a 1944 American-Swedish newspaper, not comprehensive Swedish climate data. The article's content, which lists isolated mild seasons, does not reflect long-term climate trends and has been inaccurately attributed to a representative of the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI).;1. What is the claim being assessed? The claim being assessed is that a newspaper clipping from 1989, stating In February 1722, all the trees were completely green and listing other historical mild periods, proves that climate change is a natural phenomenon and not primarily caused by human activity. This claim is used by climate skeptics to dispute the scientific consensus on anthropogenic global warming. 2. What is the verdict (true/false/mixed)? False. 3. What reasoning or evidence supports the conclusion? The conclusion is supported by several points:  Misleading Origin and Context: The newspaper clipping from Norrköpings Tidningar (NT) in 1989 is largely based on an earlier article from Vestkusten, an American-Swedish newspaper from 1944. The Vestkusten article, in turn, cited Sv. Landsbygden and included anecdotes about weather in Germany, not solely Sweden. The 1989 NT article omitted references to Germany and inaccurately implied the information came from an SMHI precipitation monitor.  Anecdotal vs. Climatic Data: The historical weather notes are isolated anecdotes (snapshot, scattered years) and do not constitute systematic, long-term climate data. True climate analysis requires continuous, longer time series and larger geographical areas, which only began in Sweden in 1722 for weather observations and much later for comprehensive climate studies.  Misrepresentation of SMHI: The article's reference to Gunnar Carlberg, who is also SMHI's precipitation monitor, is misleading. While an Inez Carlberg was a precipitation observer for SMHI in Finspång, the job involves daily rain gauge checks, not historical climate analysis or research. Any such collection of old clippings would have been done as a private individual, not in an official SMHI capacity. SMHI explicitly states that the information in the article does not come from them.  Scientific Consensus on Anthropogenic Climate Change: The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) unequivocally states that human influence, mainly through greenhouse gas emissions, has unequivocally warmed the climate system. Global average temperatures have increased faster since 1970 than in any other 50-year period for at least the last 2,000 years. While natural variations exist, the warming observed since 1980 is primarily attributed to human-added greenhouse gases.;Viral Claim of Green Trees in February 1722 Exposed as False: A Misleading Article on Climate Change;A viral newspaper clipping claims that in February 1722, all trees were completely green, sparking debate about climate change. However, fact-checking reveals the article is misleading, with its content actually describing weather in Germany, not Sweden, and lacking any relevance to current climate trends. The image has been manipulated over time to fit a narrative contradicting human-induced global warming. Key Findings: Origin of the Article: The article originated from a 1944 newspaper called Vestkusten, which featured statistics on mild winters in Germany. Manipulation: The article was later altered to appear as though it referred to Swedish conditions, with the removal of references to Germany. Climate Change Reality: Human activities, particularly greenhouse gas emissions, are significantly contributing to global warming, according to the IPCC. Weather vs. Climate: Experts emphasize the difference between weather and climate, stressing that short-term weather fluctuations do not disprove long-term climate trends ¹ ².;Fact-Check Verdict Claim Being Assessed: A viral newspaper clipping claims that in February 1722, all trees were completely green, which is used to argue against human-induced global warming. Verdict: False Reasoning or Evidence: The article originated from a 1944 newspaper called Vestkusten, which featured statistics on mild winters in Germany, not Sweden. The article was later altered to appear as though it referred to Swedish conditions, with the removal of references to Germany. Experts emphasize the difference between weather and climate, stressing that short-term weather fluctuations do not disprove long-term climate trends. Human activities, particularly greenhouse gas emissions, are significantly contributing to global warming, according to the IPCC ¹.;Claim of Naturally Green Trees in Sweden Since 1172 Used to Deny Climate Change Is False;A viral newspaper clipping claiming mild winters in Sweden, dating back to 1172, has been used by climate skeptics to argue that climate change is natural, but the article is misleading, primarily referencing German weather and lacking credible climate data. Investigations reveal the text was repurposed from a 1944 article, edited to imply Swedish conditions, and does not refute the scientific consensus that human-driven greenhouse gas emissions are the primary cause of modern global warming.;1. Claim Being Assessed: The claim, circulated by climate skeptics on social media, is that a newspaper clipping from 1989, listing mild winters in various years (e.g., 1172, 1722), demonstrates that significant climate variations, such as trees turning green in February, have occurred naturally in Sweden for centuries, implying that current global warming is not primarily caused by human activity but is instead part of natural climate variability driven by factors like solar activity. 2. Verdict: False. 3. Reasoning and Evidence Supporting the Conclusion: - Misleading Origin and Context: The newspaper clipping, published in Norrköpings Tidningar (NT) on February 15, 1989, is authentic but misleading. It was found to be largely derived from a 1944 article in Vestkusten, a Swedish-American newspaper, which primarily described weather conditions in Germany, not Sweden. The NT article omits references to Germany, creating a false impression that the listed weather events occurred in Sweden. - Lack of Credible Source: The NT article attributes the information to Gunnar Carlberg, described as an SMHI precipitation monitor in Finspång. However, SMHI has no record of a Gunnar Carlberg, and the role of a precipitation monitor does not involve historical weather analysis. The cited clip albums are vague and unreliable, as no Swedish weather records exist for many of the years mentioned (e.g., 1172), and systematic weather measurements in Sweden only began in 1722 in Uppsala. - Weather vs. Climate Misrepresentation: The article lists isolated weather events (e.g., mild winters or early blooming) without providing continuous data or context, which is insufficient to draw conclusions about climate trends. Climate requires long-term, systematic data over large areas, whereas the clipping describes sporadic, local weather anomalies, some of which pertain to Germany. - Scientific Consensus Contradicted: The claim that natural factors like solar activity drive current climate variations is refuted by the IPCC’s latest report, which states that human-induced greenhouse gas emissions have “unequivocally warmed the climate system” and that global warming since 1970 is unprecedented in at least 2,000 years. Natural factors alone cannot account for the observed warming trend, as confirmed by physics-based climate models. - Viral Misuse: The clipping has been shared on platforms like Klimatupplysningen (2015) and Facebook (2020, 2024) by climate skeptic groups, such as Klimatrealisterna, to misleadingly argue against human-driven climate change. The selective editing of the original text and its misrepresentation as Swedish weather data further undermines its credibility. In summary, the claim is false because the article misrepresents German weather anecdotes as Swedish, lacks credible sourcing, and does not provide evidence to challenge the scientific consensus that human activities are the primary driver of current global warming.
FC_04;Lead;Green trees in February 1722 not proof of climate change;An old newspaper clipping about green trees in the spring of 1722 is making the rounds on social media, but the content doesn't mean what the spreaders seem to think. And the source turns out to be suspiciously similar to another text - which is about Germany.;This is the fact-check :For several years, a newspaper clipping with the headline “In February 1722, all the trees were completely green” has been circulating among climate skeptics on social media. The Source Criticism Agency is investigating the origin of the image – and the truth behind its content.It turns out that the anecdotal article doesn't actually say anything about the climate. And when we dig deeper into the archives, it turns out that large parts of the text aren't even about Swedish conditions – but about the weather in Germany.Post on Facebook with the image April 23, 2024.This is the text in what appears to be a photocopied newspaper article:  In February 1722, all the trees were completely green  . There have certainly been mild winters in the past. Gunnar Carlberg, who is also SMHI's precipitation monitor in Finspång, has looked through old scrapbooks and found the following interesting statistics:  In 1172, the winter was so mild that the trees turned green at the end of January. The birds built their nests and molted in February.  In 1241, the trees were fully leafed out in March.  In 1269, there was no winter at all.  In 1421, the trees bloomed in March and the vines in April, when there were also ripe gooseberries.  In 1538, the trees in the gardens were in full bloom already in December!  In 1585, the corn was in ear at Easter time.  In 1588, the trees turned green in February.  In 1538, 1607, 1617, 1650 and 1659, there was neither snow nor frost.  In 1722, all the trees were green in February.  In 1863, in Skåne, you could pick fully bloomed daisies in February.  NT Wednesday, February 15, 1989 The source criticism agency begins by examining the context in which the image was shared. The first post we find is from 2015 on the blog Klimatupplysningen, which is run by Klimatrealisterna, formerly the Stockholm Initiative. In 2010, the lobby group Stockholm Initiative was named Misleader of the Year by the public education association Vetenskap och Folkbildning . In the book “Upphettning: demokratin i klimatkrisens tid” (published in 2020 by the publisher Fri tanke), the Climate Realists are identified as “the hub of the Swedish denial movement”.  It was on Christmas Eve 2015 that Klimatupplysningen posted the image, stating that it came from a reader. The blog post has 112 comments.Commentary on Klimatupplysningen's blog post 2015.However, it will take five years for the image to truly go viral. Most of the shares we find are from 2020. The newspaper clipping appears on Twitter/X, Facebook and blogs that are skeptical of climate research. The fact that the picture is gaining momentum in the spring of 2020 is probably due to the fact that the spring was warmer and drier than normal that year, according to SMHI's measurements. In the cities of Gothenburg, Nordkoster, Visby and Hoburg, records were broken in the number of hours of sunshine. Weather and climate were on people's lips.But now it's spring again and the latest sharing we can find of the picture is from last week. A man writes on Facebook:It's time to let go of the lies that people's way of life affects the climate... The climate has always varied and this depends, among other things, on the activities of the sun...The post has over 500 interactions on Facebook. “This is something for all our almost religious climate activists to read,” writes one person in the comments section.But is what the post writer claims really true?No, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) writes in its latest report that “human influence, mainly through greenhouse gas emissions, has unequivocally warmed the climate system”. It is also “unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, the ocean and the land”. “The global average temperature has increased faster since 1970 than during any other 50-year period for at least the last 2,000 years.”– According to the UN's climate panel IPCC, the global warming that has occurred since 1980 is mainly caused by anthropogenic greenhouse gases, i.e. the greenhouse gases that humans have added to the atmosphere. But that does not mean that there are also other natural climate variations, explains Sverker Hellström, meteorologist at SMHI.We will return to the science later in the article.The newspaper article from 1989The content of the NT article itself has been quoted by climate skeptics in several editorial media. For example, in articles in the Länstidningen (LT) in Östersund and on the debate page of the newspaper Norra Skånes .But what does the image of the article actually prove? Our review is not going to show much at all.We start with the authenticity of the material. With the naked eye, you can see that the image appears to have been scanned and appears to consist of two parts cut together. A date from the newspaper, “NT Wednesday 5 February 1989” and the news text itself. NT is short for Norrköpings Tidningar, a newspaper founded in 1758 and now Sweden’s oldest daily newspaper still in publication.A number of larger libraries in Sweden have old Swedish newspapers preserved on microfilm.Carolina Rediviva. Photo: Dr. Mirko Junge/Wikimedia commonsAt the Carolina Rediviva University Library in Uppsala, we check to see if an article with the headline In February 1722 all the trees were completely green was published in the NT on February 15, 1989. And yes, it was.On the local pages for Finspång in NT there is the article, also not signed with a name, just like in the viral image. It is therefore some kind of local news article, but the text has an unusually slangy form for newspaper prose. No quotes, just lists of different years.SMHI's “precipitation monitor”The only source reference in the article is to a Gunnar Carlberg who is stated to be a so-called precipitation monitor for SMHI in Finspång. The title is so unusual that the only results we get when we google “precipitation monitor” are back to the NT article from 1989.There are also no notes at SMHI about a Gunnar Carlberg who worked for the authority. However, there is an Inez Carlberg who was a precipitation observer in Finspång in the 80s.– You can imagine that Gunnar was Inez's husband and that they ran the weather station together, muses Sverker Hellström, meteorologist at SMHI.According to the article, Gunnar is said to have “looked through old music albums and found the following interesting statistics.” It may sound like Gunnar did this in his capacity as a member of some role at SMHI, but that is not the case, states Sverker Hellström.Post on Facebook with the newspaper article 2020.A precipitation monitor checks the rain gauge once a day, but the job does not involve any further analysis of the weather and wind – and certainly not going back in time. Gunnar (or someone else) would have collected his clips as a private person, not as an employee of SMHI.– You might get the feeling that the information in the article comes from SMHI, but that is not the case, says Sverker Hellström to Källkritikbyrån.Which clip albums Gunnar Carlberg would have looked at is also not clear from the NT article. The source reference itself is weak to say the least. Clip albums often refer to newspaper clippings, but the oldest Swedish newspaper, Post- och Inrikestidningar, was founded in 1645 – that is, long after several of the years mentioned in the article.Weather measurements started in 1722The NT article itself basically consists of just a list of mild seasons from different seasons. The first weather note dates back to 1172. But in 1172 no weather measurements were made in Sweden.Comment on Facebook March 13.It was also only in the 17th and 18th centuries that humans invented measuring tools for temperature and climate. And the oldest Swedish weather observations in Sweden date back to 1722. They were made at the weather station in Uppsala.– The measurement series began in 1722 and it was professors Anders Celsius and Eric Burman who initiated them, says Erik Sahlée, senior lecturer in meteorology at Uppsala University and responsible for Uppsala University's weather observations.Are these the oldest weather observations in Sweden?– Yes, that's it.But the information that appears in the NT article, can't it be true anyway?– It may be that they are correct. But this is just a snapshot, scattered years. Even if they were correct as individual weather observations, they say nothing about what it looks like over time. A weather station's data for a certain year says nothing about what the climate was like. Here, you jump from year to year and do not describe any longer measurement series, says Erik Sahlée.Search result on Pettersson's blog 2018.The weather notes in the text actually say nothing about the climate, but describe local weather at a certain time. And the question is, are they even about Swedish conditions?From a magazine for American SwedesA private individual conducted his own viral review of the image in January 2020 in a local Facebook group. He believes that the article text comes from a clip from March 2, 1944, from the newspaper Vestkusten, a weekly newspaper for Swedes on the Pacific coast.Comment on Facebook January 5, 2020.According to Wikipedia, Vestkusten is actually a newspaper that existed. It was originally a Swedish-language newspaper that was published in California from 1887 to 2007. The newspaper is preserved in digital form at the California Digital Newspaper Collection .Peace talks, bombing raids and ration cards are some of the topics covered on the newspaper's front page on March 2, 1944. There is still full-scale war in Europe and between the USA and Japan.Vestkusten front page March 2, 1944We search through article by article in the digitized newspaper – and a few pages in we actually find a text that is confusingly similar to that published in the NT.This is what Vestkusten writes:Speaking of the mild winter, Sv. Landsbygden has collected the following rather unusual statistics about mild winters:In 1172 the winter was so mild that the trees turned green at the end of January and the birds built their nests and moulted in February.In 1241 the trees were fully leafed out in March, i.e. six weeks earlier than usual.In 1269 there was no winter at all, the temperature was so warm that the girls in the Rhine region could adorn themselves with violet wreaths at Christmas time.In 1289 there was no winter either and the temperature was as mild as the latter year at the same time. In1421 the trees bloomed in March and the vines in April, when there were also ripe gooseberries.In 1538 the gardens were in full bloom in December.In 1572 the trees already bore leaves in February, just like in 1172.In 1588 the trees were green in February.In 1538, 1607 and 1659 there was neither snow nor frost.In 1601 and 1609 there was no winter in southern Germany.In 1662 the winter was so mild that even in northern Germany people did not light fires in tiled stoves and the trees bloomed in February.In 1722 all the trees were green in February.In 1807 Bore did not come to visit at all.In 1834 the winter was as mild as the last mentioned.In 1863 in Skåne you could pick fully bloomed daisies in February. In 1870 New Year's Day was celebrated in Petersburg at a temperature of eight degrees.From the newspaper Vestkusten, March 2, 1944It is largely the same text that was published in NT 45 years later. But here the reference is to Sv. Landsbygden and not to any rainfall monitor in Finspång. Sv. Landsbygden is probably short for the newspaper Svenska Landsbygden. We have received confirmation from the Royal Library (KB) that the newspaper existed at this time.About German weatherFurthermore, the text in the West Coast is somewhat longer than that in the NT, and several of the dates refer to conditions in Germany.– It is not clear in the NT article that the notes come from any particular place. In 1863 it says about Skåne itself and then we had started our own measurements. But otherwise it does not say where it took place, so it could be in Germany, says Sverker Hellström at SMHI.According to SMHI's records, the average temperature in Skåne in January and February 1863 was plus degrees.– It was certainly experienced as warm then. But if you compare it to today, for example, the average temperature in Lund in 2020 was three degrees warmer than it was in 1863.The information in the form of a submission in Folkbladet 2022 .We cannot say for sure if it is the same text that is reused in the NT, but there is much evidence to suggest so. Both we ourselves and the Google AI service NootbookLM have difficulty finding differences between the texts.It seems as if someone has taken the original text and edited out certain years, as well as all information about Germany. And suddenly a new story about Swedish springs and winters has been created. A story that is not entirely true – and which is now being used to mislead on the internet.Climate change and weatherSo what was it like now, is there a difference between climate and weather?– Yes, there is a difference between climate and weather. I usually make the following analogy: the climate tells you what clothes to bring and the weather tells you what clothes to wear. The climate is what you expect and the weather is what you get. A climate has a natural weather variation and the variations become larger if we look at a smaller area, says Erik Sahlée at Uppsala University.Comment on Facebook March 13.To describe changes in the climate, weather observations from continuous, longer time series and larger geographical areas are needed. These also exist.– If you look up and compile what we have seen across Europe and the world, the warming global trend is not something to discuss. That it is happening as a result of human influence is also not something to discuss. Now we need to start talking about what we should do about climate change instead – and how we can adapt.How do we know that climate change is due to human influence?– Physics shows that. When you just look at how natural factors affect global temperature, you don't get as strong a warming as we have. We humans have created that amplification.Overall: Many have used the image to contradict the idea that humans are behind the global warming that is currently taking place. But according to research, it is people's way of life that has affected the climate.And as for the photographed article itself, it turned out to have made a remarkable journey across media of different times. An article about German weather from the 1940s was remade in the Swedish local press in the 1980s into something that appears to apply to Sweden and that appears to come from a representative of SMHI – to finally spin around as a screenshot on Facebook in the 2020s. ;Least-to-most ;Claim That “All Trees Were Green in February 1722” Is Misleading — Historical Weather Anecdotes Don’t Disprove Human-Caused Climate Change;The claim that in February 1722 all the trees were completely green, suggesting unusual historical climate conditions, is being evaluated. The final verdict is that this claim is misleading—based on a repurposed and partly inaccurate newspaper clipping that mixes weather anecdotes from different times and places, not a reliable record of Sweden’s climate. This fact-check reveals how an old article about German weather was edited and misrepresented to cast doubt on human-driven climate change.;1. What is the claim? That in February 1722 all the trees were completely green, indicating historically mild winters that challenge the idea of current human-caused climate change. 2. What is the final verdict? The claim is misleading and false as presented. 3. What evidence supports this verdict?  The original newspaper clipping is a re-edited version of a 1944 article about weather mostly in Germany, not Sweden.  The source cited, Gunnar Carlberg as an SMHI precipitation monitor, is unverified and likely fictional.  Weather observations only began in Sweden in 1722, making earlier claims anecdotal at best.  The article lists isolated weather events rather than continuous climate data, which cannot be used to dispute long-term climate trends.  Scientific consensus from the IPCC and experts confirms recent global warming is mainly caused by human greenhouse gas emissions, regardless of historic weather anecdotes.;Green Trees in February 1722 Claim About Past Winters Is False, Misleading Climate Skeptics;A newspaper clipping claiming In February 1722, all the trees were completely green has been circulating among climate skeptics as evidence against human-caused climate change. This claim is largely false and misleading. The original article, published in 1989, was a re-edited version of a 1944 article from a Swedish-American newspaper, primarily discussing weather conditions in Germany, not Sweden, and presenting anecdotal observations rather than scientific climate data.;"Here's the verdict for the fact-check: 1. What is the claim? The claim, circulated by climate skeptics, is based on a newspaper clipping stating In February 1722, all the trees were completely green, implying that historical mild winters negate the idea of human-caused climate change and that the climate has always varied due to natural factors. 2. What is the final verdict? False and Misleading. 3. What evidence supports this verdict?  Misleading Origin and Content: The widely circulated image is of an article from Norrköpings Tidningar (NT) published on February 15, 1989. However, this NT article is largely a re-edited and abridged version of a much older article from Vestkusten, a Swedish-language newspaper published in California, dated March 2, 1944.  Geographical Misrepresentation: The original Vestkusten article, from which the NT article derived, explicitly refers to weather conditions in Germany for several of the historical dates (e.g., the girls in the Rhine region, no winter in southern Germany, even in northern Germany). The NT article removed these geographical references, making it appear as if all the observations were about Swedish conditions, which is not true for most of the early entries.  Unreliable Sourcing in NT: The NT article ambiguously attributes the information to a Gunnar Carlberg, stated to be an SMHI's precipitation monitor in Finspång, who supposedly looked through old scrapbooks. SMHI (Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute) confirms no record of a Gunnar Carlberg in that role, and that the job of a precipitation monitor does not involve historical climate analysis. Any collection of such data would have been done as a private person, not as an SMHI employee, and SMHI disavows the information originating from them.  Lack of Scientific Basis for Early Dates: The article lists weather observations from as early as 1172. However, organized weather measurements in Sweden (starting in Uppsala) only began in 1722. Therefore, information prior to 1722 cannot be based on systematic scientific measurements in Sweden, and the earlier notes are anecdotal.  Misinterpretation of Weather vs. Climate: The listed observations are isolated snapshots of local weather events, not continuous, long-term climate data. Meteorologists and climate scientists emphasize that individual weather events, even unusually warm ones, do not define climate trends. Climate refers to long-term patterns and averages over larger geographical areas.  Scientific Consensus on Human Influence: The article's use by climate skeptics to deny human-caused warming directly contradicts the overwhelming scientific consensus, as stated by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The IPCC unequivocally states that human influence, mainly through greenhouse gas emissions, has unequivocally warmed the climate system and that the global average temperature increase since 1970 is the fastest in at least 2,000 years, primarily due to anthropogenic greenhouse gases. Physics supports that natural factors alone cannot explain the observed warming trend; human influence creates the amplification.";Debunked: 1989 Article Claiming Mild Winters in Sweden Doesn't Stand Up to Scrutiny Fact-Check Verdict: False;Climate skeptics have been sharing a 1989 newspaper article claiming Sweden experienced unusually mild winters in the past, such as trees being green in February 1722. However, an investigation reveals the article's origins are murky, and its content likely refers to German weather conditions, not Swedish climate data, rendering the claim misleading in the context of climate change debates.;Fact-Check Verdict 1. Claim The claim is that a 1989 newspaper article proves Sweden experienced unusually mild winters in the past, specifically with trees being green in February 1722, implying this contradicts human influence on climate change. 2. Final Verdict FALSE/MISLEADING: The article's content was misused to suggest past Swedish weather conditions unrelated to current climate change debates. 3. Evidence Supporting the Verdict Origin of the Article: The article's text likely originated from a 1944 article about German weather, not Swedish conditions. Lack of Swedish Context: The article lacks clear references to Swedish weather measurements or climate data, making it inapplicable to Sweden's climate. Misattribution: The article attributes the information to a precipitation monitor at SMHI (Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute), but SMHI has no record of such a person, and the job title seems fictional. Climate vs. Weather: Experts distinguish between climate and weather, stating that scattered weather observations from different years don't prove long-term climate trends. IPCC Findings: According to the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), human influence, mainly through greenhouse gas emissions, has unequivocally warmed the climate system ¹ ².;Viral Claim of Historical Swedish Winters Disproving Climate Change Is Misleading, Rooted in Misrepresented German Weather Reports;A viral newspaper clipping from 1989, claiming mild winters in Sweden dating back to 1172, has been used by climate skeptics to argue that climate change is not human-driven. The Source Criticism Agency's investigation reveals the article is misleading, with much of its content originating from a 1944 American-Swedish newspaper about German weather, not Swedish conditions. This fact-check exposes how a manipulated historical text has been misused to challenge the well-established scientific consensus that human activities, primarily greenhouse gas emissions, are driving global warming.;1. What is the claim? The claim is that a newspaper clipping from 1989, citing historical mild winters in Sweden (e.g., In February 1722, all the trees were completely green), suggests that current climate change is not caused by human activity but is instead part of natural climate variations, as shared by climate skeptics on social media. 2. What is the final verdict? The claim is misleading. The newspaper article does not provide evidence to refute human-driven climate change, and its content is misrepresented as it largely describes weather conditions in Germany, not Sweden, and lacks reliable sourcing. 3. What evidence supports this verdict? - Origin of the article: The 1989 Norrköpings Tidningar (NT) article was found to be authentic but derived from a 1944 article in Vestkusten, a Swedish-American newspaper, which discussed mild winters primarily in Germany, not Sweden. References to Germany were omitted in the NT version, creating a misleading impression of Swedish conditions. - Lack of credible sourcing: The NT article cites Gunnar Carlberg, described as an SMHI precipitation monitor, but SMHI has no record of him, and the role does not involve historical weather analysis. The source of the historical data (clip albums) is vague and unverifiable, especially for claims predating systematic weather records (e.g., 1172). - Historical weather data limitations: Systematic weather measurements in Sweden began in 1722, making claims about earlier years (e.g., 1172, 1241) unreliable. The article’s listed years are anecdotal, describing isolated weather events, not climate trends. - Scientific consensus: The IPCC’s reports confirm that human-induced greenhouse gas emissions are the primary driver of global warming since 1970, with a faster temperature increase than any 50-year period in the last 2,000 years. Natural climate variations exist but do not negate human impact. - Misuse by skeptics: The article has been shared on platforms like Klimatupplysningen (2015) and social media (2020, 2024) to argue against human-driven climate change, ignoring the distinction between weather (short-term, local) and climate (long-term, global). The text’s German origin and lack of context further undermine its relevance to the claim.

The source reference itself is weak to say the least. Clip albums often refer to newspaper clippings, but the oldest Swedish newspaper, Post- och Inrikestidningar, was founded in 1645 – that is, long after several of the years mentioned in the article.Weather measurements started in 1722The NT article itself basically consists of just a list of mild seasons from different seasons.

But this is just a snapshot, scattered years. Even if they were correct as individual weather observations, they say nothing about what it looks like over time.

And the question is, are they even about Swedish conditions?From a magazine for American SwedesA private individual conducted his own viral review of the image in January 2020 in a local Facebook group. He believes that the article text comes from a clip from March 2, 1944, from the newspaper Vestkusten, a weekly newspaper for Swedes on the Pacific coast.Comment on Facebook January 5, 2020.According to Wikipedia, Vestkusten is actually a newspaper that existed. It was originally a Swedish-language newspaper that was published in California from 1887 to 2007. The newspaper is preserved in digital form at the California Digital Newspaper Collection .Peace talks, bombing raids and ration cards are some of the topics covered on the newspaper's front page on March 2, 1944. There is still full-scale war in Europe and between the USA and Japan.Vestkusten front page March 2, 1944We search through article by article in the digitized newspaper – and a few pages in we actually find a text that is confusingly similar to that published in the NT.This is what Vestkusten writes:Speaking of the mild winter, Sv. Landsbygden has collected the following rather unusual statistics about mild winters:In 1172 the winter was so mild that the trees turned green at the end of January and the birds built their nests and moulted in February.In 1241 the trees were fully leafed out in March, i.e. six weeks earlier than usual.In 1269 there was no winter at all, the temperature was so warm that the girls in the Rhine region could adorn themselves with violet wreaths at Christmas time.In 1289 there was no winter either and the temperature was as mild as the latter year at the same time. In1421 the trees bloomed in March and the vines in April, when there were also ripe gooseberries.In 1538 the gardens were in full bloom in December.In 1572 the trees already bore leaves in February, just like in 1172.In 1588 the trees were green in February.In 1538, 1607 and 1659 there was neither snow nor frost.In 1601 and 1609 there was no winter in southern Germany.In 1662 the winter was so mild that even in northern Germany people did not light fires in tiled stoves and the trees bloomed in February.In 1722 all the trees were green in February.In 1807 Bore did not come to visit at all.In 1834 the winter was as mild as the last mentioned.In 1863 in Skåne you could pick fully bloomed daisies in February. In 1870 New Year's Day was celebrated in Petersburg at a temperature of eight degrees.From the newspaper Vestkusten, March 2, 1944It is largely the same text that was published in NT 45 years later. But here the reference is to Sv. Landsbygden and not to any rainfall monitor in Finspång. Sv. Landsbygden is probably short for the newspaper Svenska Landsbygden. We have received confirmation from the Royal Library (KB) that the newspaper existed at this time.About German weatherFurthermore, the text in the West Coast is somewhat longer than that in the NT, and several of the dates refer to conditions in Germany.– It is not clear in the NT article that the notes come from any particular place. In 1863 it says about Skåne itself and then we had started our own measurements. But otherwise it does not say where it took place, so it could be in Germany, says Sverker Hellström at SMHI.According to SMHI's records, the average temperature in Skåne in January and February 1863 was plus degrees.– It was certainly experienced as warm then. But if you compare it to today, for example, the average temperature in Lund in 2020 was three degrees warmer than it was in 1863.The information in the form of a submission in Folkbladet 2022 .We cannot say for sure if it is the same text that is reused in the NT, but there is much evidence to suggest so. Both we ourselves and the Google AI service NootbookLM have difficulty finding differences between the texts.It seems as if someone has taken the original text and edited out certain years, as well as all information about Germany. And suddenly a new story about Swedish springs and winters has been created. A story that is not entirely true – and which is now being used to mislead on the internet.Climate change and weatherSo what was it like now, is there a difference between climate and weather?– Yes, there is a difference between climate and weather. I usually make the following analogy: the climate tells you what clothes to bring and the weather tells you what clothes to wear. The climate is what you expect and the weather is what you get. A climate has a natural weather variation and the variations become larger if we look at a smaller area, says Erik Sahlée at Uppsala University.Comment on Facebook March 13.To describe changes in the climate, weather observations from continuous, longer time series and larger geographical areas are needed. These also exist.– If you look up and compile what we have seen across Europe and the world, the warming global trend is not something to discuss. That it is happening as a result of human influence is also not something to discuss. Now we need to start talking about what we should do about climate change instead – and how we can adapt.How do we know that climate change is due to human influence?– Physics shows that. When you just look at how natural factors affect global temperature, you don't get as strong a warming as we have. We humans have created that amplification.Overall: Many have used the image to contradict the idea that humans are behind the global warming that is currently taking place. But according to research, it is people's way of life that has affected the climate.And as for the photographed article itself, it turned out to have made a remarkable journey across media of different times. An article about German weather from the 1940s was remade in the Swedish local press in the 1980s into something that appears to apply to Sweden and that appears to come from a representative of SMHI – to finally spin around as a screenshot on Facebook in the 2020s. ;Role;Historic “Green Trees in February 1722” Claim Misused to Cast Doubt on Human-Driven Climate Change — Context and Sources Reveal It’s Misleading;A widely shared newspaper clipping claiming that “in February 1722, all the trees were completely green” is being used by climate skeptics to dispute human-caused global warming. However, the original article largely references weather in Germany, not Sweden, relies on anecdotal and unverifiable sources, and does not reflect climate data—making the claim misleading and inaccurate.;1. What is the claim? The claim is that historical weather records show extremely mild winters—such as all trees being green in February 1722—which skeptics use to argue that current climate change is natural and not caused by human activity. 2. What is the verdict? The claim is misleading and inaccurate. The newspaper clipping does not provide reliable evidence of past climate conditions in Sweden, and it has been taken out of context to cast doubt on well-established scientific findings about human-driven climate change. 3. What evidence supports this decision?  The original article mixes weather anecdotes from various years and locations, including Germany, not exclusively Sweden.  The cited source, “Gunnar Carlberg,” has no verifiable connection to SMHI, and the data appear to come from private newspaper clippings, not scientific records.  Reliable weather measurements in Sweden only began in 1722, and none confirm the extreme claims presented.  Climate experts emphasize that isolated weather events or scattered years do not represent long-term climate trends.  The UN IPCC and Swedish meteorologists confirm that recent global warming is unequivocally driven by human greenhouse gas emissions, beyond natural variability.  The text was originally published in a 1944 American Swedish newspaper about German weather and was later altered and republished in Sweden, losing important contextual details.;Old Newspaper Clipping Falsely Claims Historic Weather Disproves Human-Caused Climate Change;A persistent newspaper clipping circulating among climate skeptics, claiming In February 1722, all the trees were completely green as evidence against human-caused climate change, is misleading. Our investigation reveals the article's original context was largely about German weather from the 1940s, not Swedish conditions, and it offers anecdotal observations, not scientific climate data. The claim that this historical weather anecdote disproves human influence on climate is false.;Here's a breakdown of the claim and its verdict:  Claim A newspaper clipping with the headline In February 1722, all the trees were completely green, presented as historical evidence of unusually mild winters, is used by climate skeptics to argue that current climate change is not human-induced and is merely part of natural climate variation.  Verdict False.  Evidence Supporting This Decision  Misleading Origin and Context: The article in question, published in Norrköpings Tidningar (NT) in 1989, is a re-edited version of an older article from Vestkusten, a Swedish-language newspaper in California, published in 1944. The original Vestkusten article explicitly refers to Sv. Landsbygden as its source and includes several observations about weather conditions in Germany, which were omitted in the NT version.  Anecdotal vs. Scientific Data: The article provides a list of scattered, anecdotal weather observations from various years, some dating back to 1172. These are snapshots of local weather events, not continuous, long-term climate measurements. True climate analysis requires consistent, systematic observations over extended periods and larger geographical areas.  Lack of Reliable Source for Early Data: Many of the early dates cited (e.g., 1172, 1241) predate the invention of weather measuring tools and the establishment of formal weather stations in Sweden (which began in Uppsala in 1722). This means the information for these early years would be based on anecdotal accounts, not scientific data.  Misrepresentation of SMHI Affiliation: The NT article misleadingly attributes the statistics to a Gunnar Carlberg, described as an SMHI's precipitation monitor. SMHI confirms no record of a Gunnar Carlberg in that role, and even if he were, a precipitation monitor's job does not involve historical climate analysis or research. The implication that the data came from SMHI is false.  Scientific Consensus on Climate Change: The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) unequivocally states that human influence, primarily through greenhouse gas emissions, has warmed the climate system. Global average temperatures have increased faster since 1970 than at any other 50-year period in at least the last 2,000 years. While natural variations exist, the current warming trend is overwhelmingly attributed to anthropogenic factors based on physical evidence.  Purposeful Manipulation: The investigation shows that information about Germany was removed from the original text, and a new narrative suggesting Swedish conditions was created, which is now being used to mislead online regarding climate change.;Here are some possible headline options: Viral Newspaper Clip on 1722 Winter Misleads on Climate Change;A viral newspaper clipping claims that in February 1722, all trees were completely green, citing Gunnar Carlberg, a supposed precipitation monitor for SMHI in Finspång. However, fact-checking reveals that the article's content is likely from a 1944 newspaper, Vestkusten, and refers to weather conditions in Germany, not Sweden. The UN's IPCC confirms human influence is the main cause of global warming since 1980, contradicting claims that the article disproves human-caused climate change.;Fact-Checking Verdict 1. Claim The claim is that a newspaper article from 1989 proves that in February 1722, all trees were completely green, and this is used to dispute human-caused climate change. 2. Verdict The verdict is FALSE. The article's content is likely from a 1944 newspaper, Vestkusten, and refers to weather conditions in Germany, not Sweden. Moreover, the UN's IPCC confirms that human influence is the main cause of global warming since 1980. 3. Evidence The evidence supporting this decision includes ¹: Origin of the Article: The article's text is similar to one published in Vestkusten, a Swedish-language newspaper in California, on March 2, 1944. The original text refers to conditions in Germany, not Sweden. Lack of SMHI Connection: There's no evidence that Gunnar Carlberg, cited as a precipitation monitor for SMHI, existed or worked in that capacity. SMHI has no records of him, and the job title seems unusual. Weather vs. Climate: The article discusses weather observations, not climate. Weather and climate are distinct, with climate referring to long-term patterns and weather to short-term conditions. IPCC Findings: The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states that human influence, mainly through greenhouse gas emissions, has unequivocally warmed the climate system since 1980. Expert Opinions: Meteorologists at SMHI and Uppsala University confirm that the article's content does not support claims about Sweden's climate in 1722 and that human activities are the primary cause of global warming.;Viral 1989 Newspaper Clipping Misleads on Climate Change, Falsely Claims Historical Swedish Weather Proves Natural Variations;A viral newspaper clipping claiming mild winters in Sweden as evidence against human-driven climate change has been debunked, revealing that the text, originally about German weather, was misrepresented and lacks scientific grounding. The Source Criticism Agency’s investigation confirms the article, circulated by climate skeptics, is a distorted version of a 1944 report, with no basis in SMHI records or climate science. The IPCC affirms human activity, particularly greenhouse gas emissions, is the primary driver of recent global warming.;1. What is the claim? The claim, circulated by climate skeptics on social media, is that a newspaper clipping from 1989, citing historical mild winters in Sweden (e.g., In February 1722, all the trees were completely green), serves as evidence that current global warming is not caused by human activity but is instead part of natural climate variations. 2. What is the verdict? The claim is false. The newspaper clipping does not provide credible evidence to refute human-driven climate change, and its content is misrepresented, as it primarily describes weather conditions in Germany, not Sweden, and lacks scientific rigor to address climate trends. 3. What evidence supports this decision? - Misrepresentation of Source: The article, published in Norrköpings Tidningar (NT) on February 15, 1989, was found to be a local news piece with no named author, relying on a questionable source, Gunnar Carlberg, described as an SMHI precipitation monitor. SMHI has no record of a Gunnar Carlberg, though an Inez Carlberg was a precipitation observer in Finspång. The article’s data is attributed to vague clip albums, not official SMHI records, undermining its credibility. - Origin of Text: The text closely matches a 1944 article from Vestkusten, a Swedish-American newspaper, which references weather conditions primarily in Germany, not Sweden. Key details, such as German locations and years, were omitted in the NT version, creating a misleading narrative about Swedish climate. - Lack of Climate Context: The article lists isolated weather events (e.g., mild winters in 1172, 1241, etc.) without continuous data or long-term trends, which are essential for climate analysis. Weather stations in Sweden only began systematic measurements in 1722, making earlier claims (e.g., 1172) unverifiable. These snapshots do not refute the IPCC’s conclusion that human-driven greenhouse gas emissions are the primary cause of global warming since 1970. - Scientific Consensus: The IPCC’s latest report confirms that human influence, through greenhouse gas emissions, has unequivocally warmed the climate, with global temperatures rising faster since 1970 than in any 50-year period in the last 2,000 years. Natural variations, as cited in the article, do not explain this accelerated warming. - Context of Circulation: The clipping was popularized by climate skeptic groups, such as Klimatrealisterna, identified as a hub of Sweden’s denial movement. Its viral spread, especially in 2020, coincided with a warmer-than-average spring, but this does not validate the claim, as weather and climate are distinct phenomena, per meteorologist Erik Sahlée. The evidence collectively shows the article is a distorted, unscientific account misused to challenge established climate science.
FC_04;Lead;Green trees in February 1722 not proof of climate change;An old newspaper clipping about green trees in the spring of 1722 is making the rounds on social media, but the content doesn't mean what the spreaders seem to think. And the source turns out to be suspiciously similar to another text - which is about Germany.;This is the fact-check :For several years, a newspaper clipping with the headline “In February 1722, all the trees were completely green” has been circulating among climate skeptics on social media. The Source Criticism Agency is investigating the origin of the image – and the truth behind its content.It turns out that the anecdotal article doesn't actually say anything about the climate. And when we dig deeper into the archives, it turns out that large parts of the text aren't even about Swedish conditions – but about the weather in Germany.Post on Facebook with the image April 23, 2024.This is the text in what appears to be a photocopied newspaper article:  In February 1722, all the trees were completely green  . There have certainly been mild winters in the past. Gunnar Carlberg, who is also SMHI's precipitation monitor in Finspång, has looked through old scrapbooks and found the following interesting statistics:  In 1172, the winter was so mild that the trees turned green at the end of January. The birds built their nests and molted in February.  In 1241, the trees were fully leafed out in March.  In 1269, there was no winter at all.  In 1421, the trees bloomed in March and the vines in April, when there were also ripe gooseberries.  In 1538, the trees in the gardens were in full bloom already in December!  In 1585, the corn was in ear at Easter time.  In 1588, the trees turned green in February.  In 1538, 1607, 1617, 1650 and 1659, there was neither snow nor frost.  In 1722, all the trees were green in February.  In 1863, in Skåne, you could pick fully bloomed daisies in February.  NT Wednesday, February 15, 1989 The source criticism agency begins by examining the context in which the image was shared. The first post we find is from 2015 on the blog Klimatupplysningen, which is run by Klimatrealisterna, formerly the Stockholm Initiative. In 2010, the lobby group Stockholm Initiative was named Misleader of the Year by the public education association Vetenskap och Folkbildning . In the book “Upphettning: demokratin i klimatkrisens tid” (published in 2020 by the publisher Fri tanke), the Climate Realists are identified as “the hub of the Swedish denial movement”.  It was on Christmas Eve 2015 that Klimatupplysningen posted the image, stating that it came from a reader. The blog post has 112 comments.Commentary on Klimatupplysningen's blog post 2015.However, it will take five years for the image to truly go viral. Most of the shares we find are from 2020. The newspaper clipping appears on Twitter/X, Facebook and blogs that are skeptical of climate research. The fact that the picture is gaining momentum in the spring of 2020 is probably due to the fact that the spring was warmer and drier than normal that year, according to SMHI's measurements. In the cities of Gothenburg, Nordkoster, Visby and Hoburg, records were broken in the number of hours of sunshine. Weather and climate were on people's lips.But now it's spring again and the latest sharing we can find of the picture is from last week. A man writes on Facebook:It's time to let go of the lies that people's way of life affects the climate...

But otherwise it does not say where it took place, so it could be in Germany, says Sverker Hellström at SMHI.According to SMHI's records, the average temperature in Skåne in January and February 1863 was plus degrees.– It was certainly experienced as warm then. But if you compare it to today, for example, the average temperature in Lund in 2020 was three degrees warmer than it was in 1863.The information in the form of a submission in Folkbladet 2022 .We cannot say for sure if it is the same text that is reused in the NT, but there is much evidence to suggest so. Both we ourselves and the Google AI service NootbookLM have difficulty finding differences between the texts.It seems as if someone has taken the original text and edited out certain years, as well as all information about Germany. And suddenly a new story about Swedish springs and winters has been created. A story that is not entirely true – and which is now being used to mislead on the internet.Climate change and weatherSo what was it like now, is there a difference between climate and weather?– Yes, there is a difference between climate and weather. I usually make the following analogy: the climate tells you what clothes to bring and the weather tells you what clothes to wear. The climate is what you expect and the weather is what you get. A climate has a natural weather variation and the variations become larger if we look at a smaller area, says Erik Sahlée at Uppsala University.Comment on Facebook March 13.To describe changes in the climate, weather observations from continuous, longer time series and larger geographical areas are needed. These also exist.– If you look up and compile what we have seen across Europe and the world, the warming global trend is not something to discuss. That it is happening as a result of human influence is also not something to discuss. Now we need to start talking about what we should do about climate change instead – and how we can adapt.How do we know that climate change is due to human influence?– Physics shows that. When you just look at how natural factors affect global temperature, you don't get as strong a warming as we have. We humans have created that amplification.Overall: Many have used the image to contradict the idea that humans are behind the global warming that is currently taking place. But according to research, it is people's way of life that has affected the climate.And as for the photographed article itself, it turned out to have made a remarkable journey across media of different times. An article about German weather from the 1940s was remade in the Swedish local press in the 1980s into something that appears to apply to Sweden and that appears to come from a representative of SMHI – to finally spin around as a screenshot on Facebook in the 2020s. ;Zero-shot;“Viral Claim That Trees Were Green in February 1722 Misrepresents Historical Weather — Fact-Check Finds It False”;A viral newspaper clipping claims that in February 1722, all the trees were completely green, suggesting historically mild winters that challenge current climate change science. However, this claim is misleading: the original article mixes weather anecdotes from different regions and centuries, and does not reflect reliable climate data. The fact-check finds the claim false, confirming that the evidence cited does not disprove human-driven global warming.;1. The claim: That historical records show extremely mild winters—such as all trees being green in February 1722—proving that climate variations are natural and that current global warming is not caused by human activities. 2. The final verdict: False. 3. Reasoning:  The newspaper clipping circulating online is based on an article that mixes anecdotal weather observations from different centuries and regions, including Germany, not just Sweden.  The original data lacks scientific rigor, with no continuous or systematic climate measurements before 1722, and the “statistics” cited come from vague sources like old newspaper clippings or “clip albums.”  Modern climate science, including reports from the UN IPCC and meteorological experts, shows unequivocal evidence that recent global warming is mainly caused by human greenhouse gas emissions.  Isolated weather events or short-term mild seasons do not represent long-term climate trends, which require consistent, long-term data over wide areas.  The article’s apparent connection to official meteorological authorities (SMHI) is misleading, as the referenced individual was not an official analyst and the data was collected privately.  The viral image distorts historical context, omitting references to other regions and turning localized weather anecdotes into a misleading narrative about Sweden’s climate history.;Green Trees in February 1722? Viral Climate Skeptic Post Debunked as False and Misleading;A newspaper clipping circulating among climate skeptics on social media, claiming that In February 1722, all the trees were completely green and presenting a list of historical mild winters, does not accurately reflect climate information or Swedish conditions. The claim is largely false. The article is an anecdotal piece, not scientific data, and originated from a 1944 American-Swedish newspaper, largely referring to weather in Germany, not Sweden, and has been misleadingly presented to suggest natural climate variability negates human-caused climate change.;"Here's the verdict for the fact-check: 1. What is the claim? The circulating newspaper clipping, with the headline “In February 1722, all the trees were completely green,” claims to provide historical evidence of naturally mild winters and varied climate conditions, implying that current climate change is not primarily human-caused. 2. What is the final verdict? False. 3. What reasoning supports this decision? The reasoning supporting this False verdict is multifaceted:  Misleading Content: The article presents anecdotal weather observations, not long-term climate data. Weather and climate are distinct; individual weather events, even historical ones, do not indicate climate trends.  Irrelevant to Climate Change: Even if the historical weather observations were accurate (which many are not, given the lack of measurement tools at the time), they do not disprove human-caused climate change. The UN IPCC unequivocally states that human influence, primarily through greenhouse gas emissions, has warmed the climate system, with the global average temperature increasing faster since 1970 than in the last 2,000 years. Natural variations still exist but do not account for the current warming trend.  Dubious Sourcing and Context: The article in question, published in a Swedish local newspaper in 1989, falsely attributes its content to an SMHI precipitation monitor. SMHI has no record of such a person in that capacity, and the job does not involve historical climate analysis. Furthermore, the article's content was found to be largely plagiarized and edited from a 1944 American-Swedish newspaper, Vestkusten, which itself was referencing an older Swedish rural newspaper. Crucially, much of the original Vestkusten text referred to weather conditions in Germany, not Sweden, and this information was removed in the 1989 version to make it appear applicable to Sweden.  Lack of Scientific Basis for Early Dates: Many of the years cited (e.g., 1172, 1241) predate the invention of weather measurement tools (17th and 18th centuries) and systematic weather observations in Sweden (which began in Uppsala in 1722). Therefore, the data for these early years cannot be considered scientifically valid weather measurements.  Intent to Mislead: The image has been widely shared by climate skeptic groups and individuals with explicit statements aiming to dismiss the reality of human-caused climate change, making its dissemination a clear attempt to misinform.";No, 1722 Trees Turning Green in February Doesn't Prove Climate Change is Natural;Here's a short lead for the fact-check article: Claim: A newspaper clipping claims that in February 1722, all trees were completely green, suggesting mild winters in the past. Verdict: False The viral newspaper clipping, which originated from a 1944 article about German weather, has been misused on social media to contradict human-induced climate change. Despite its widespread sharing, the article doesn't prove anything about climate change, and its claims about Swedish weather conditions are unfounded. Human activities, particularly greenhouse gas emissions, are significantly contributing to global warming, as supported by the IPCC's latest report ¹ ².;The claim being evaluated is that a newspaper clipping from 1989 proves mild winters in the past, specifically citing instances like February 1722 when all trees were completely green. This claim has been shared on social media to contradict human-induced climate change. Verdict: False Reasoning: Origin of the Article: The article originated from a 1944 newspaper called Vestkusten, which discussed German weather, not Swedish conditions as implied by the viral image. The text was later modified and published in a Swedish local newspaper in 1989. Lack of Scientific Basis: The article's content lacks scientific basis, listing scattered years with mild winters without providing a comprehensive view of climate patterns. Weather measurements in Sweden didn't start until 1722, making claims about earlier years unreliable. Misrepresentation of SMHI: The article falsely attributes the information to Gunnar Carlberg, a supposed precipitation monitor for SMHI (Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute). There's no record of such a person working in this capacity at SMHI. Climate vs. Weather: The article confuses climate with weather, failing to provide evidence for long-term climate trends. Climate scientists emphasize that weather observations from specific years don't prove anything about climate change ¹. Scientific Consensus: The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concludes that human influence, mainly through greenhouse gas emissions, has unequivocally warmed the climate system. Natural climate variations exist, but human activities are significantly contributing to global warming.;Claim of Green Trees in February 1722 Used to Deny Climate Change Proven Misleading and Misattributed;A viral newspaper clipping from 1989, claiming mild winters like In February 1722, all the trees were completely green to suggest climate varies naturally, has been debunked as misleading, with many references misattributed to German weather and no evidence to counter human-driven climate change confirmed by the IPCC.;1. Claim: A newspaper clipping from 1989, shared by climate skeptics, cites historical mild winters (e.g., In February 1722, all the trees were completely green) to argue that climate has always varied naturally and human activity does not influence it. 2. Final Verdict: False. 3. Reasoning: - Misrepresentation of Data: The clipping, originally published in Norrköpings Tidningar (NT) in 1989, lists anecdotal mild winters from various years, but many references (e.g., 1172, 1241, 1269) predate systematic weather records in Sweden, which began in 1722. The text closely resembles a 1944 article from Vestkusten, a Swedish-American newspaper, which explicitly refers to German weather conditions, not Swedish. The NT article omits this context, misleadingly implying the events occurred in Sweden. - Lack of Credible Source: The NT article attributes the data to Gunnar Carlberg, described as an SMHI precipitation monitor in Finspång, but SMHI has no record of such a person or role. Precipitation observers do not analyze historical climate data, and the cited clip albums lack verifiable origins, weakening the source. - Climate vs. Weather: The clipping describes isolated weather events, not long-term climate trends. Experts like Erik Sahlée emphasize that single-year observations cannot refute climate patterns, which require continuous, long-term data over large areas. The IPCC confirms human-driven greenhouse gas emissions as the primary cause of global warming since 1970, a trend not contradicted by historical weather anomalies. - Intent to Mislead: Shared by climate skeptic groups like Klimatrealisterna, the clipping is used to downplay human-driven climate change. However, scientific evidence, including IPCC reports, unequivocally shows human influence has accelerated global warming, making the clipping’s implication false.

But the insects are provoking the anger of both conspiracy theorists and far-right politicians.;Here is the fact-check paper:A new type of food is slowly creeping into the company of 5G technology and corona vaccines. On social media, in alternative online media and among European politicians on the far right, there is a particular aversion to edible insects.Not only are insects, which fall under the category of novel food, called unappetizing, they are also seen in corners of the internet as part of an international elite's plan to introduce a new world order.Rikke Peters, an associate professor at UCL Business Academy and researcher into conspiracy theories, is new to the idea that edible insects have become a topic in conspiracy circles. But she is not the least bit surprised:“I see several parallels to existing conspiracy theories. The edible insects tap into a fear that an elite will impose some kind of eco-dictatorship and take away our individual food choices,” she says.But how did insects end up in cahoots with people like Bill Gates, and why are they interpreted as part of a socialist takeover of the world?Multi-faceted climate benefitInsects have attracted great interest as a food source because advocates have recognized that they contain large amounts of protein and are therefore suitable as both food and animal feed. Among the more popular edible insects are species such as the grasshopper, mealworm and cricket, and their production emits far less CO2 than the animals we normally eat. According to the National Food Institute at the Technical University of Denmark, for example, the production of cattle emits 100 times more greenhouse gases than the production of edible insects.Among those who care about climate and the environment, we find international organizations such as the UN and the World Economic Forum. The UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) praises insects for being nutritious , sustainable and cheap, and thus a tool to end hunger and help developing countries in a sustainable way. For much the same reason, the World Economic Forum also promotes eating insects .

Photo: Fabrice Coffrini;Vanilla;False Claim: Edible Insects Are Poisonous and Part of Global Elite Conspiracy;Edible Insects and Conspiracies: Edible insects have become a target of conspiracy theories, especially among far-right groups and social media users, who link them to elite agendas like the UN’s Agenda 21 and the World Economic Forum’s Great Reset, claiming they represent forced eco-dictatorship and loss of food freedom.  Scientific and Regulatory Reality: Contrary to viral claims that insects are poisonous or carcinogenic due to chitin, food-authority-approved insects are safe to eat. Four types are currently authorized in the EU, following thorough safety assessments by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).  Misinformation Sources and Spread: False claims about insect toxicity spread through social media, blogs like Danmark Vågner, and far-right media. These claims are often recycled from older conspiracy rhetoric and amplified by populist politicians across Europe to push anti-EU and anti-globalist narratives.;Verdict: False The central claim—that edible insects are poisonous or carcinogenic and part of a global elite conspiracy to control the population—is not supported by scientific evidence or regulatory facts. Approved insects have been deemed safe by food authorities like the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), and conspiracy narratives linking them to elite agendas are unfounded.;Fact Check: Claims That Edible Insects Are Poisonous and Part of a 'New World Order' Are False;"Edible insects, recognized for their protein content and environmental benefits by organizations like the UN and the World Economic Forum (WEF), have become a focal point for conspiracy theories. These theories often link insect consumption to the concept of an eco-dictatorship or New World Order being imposed by a global elite, specifically associating the practice with the WEF's The Great Reset.  Misinformation spread on social media, particularly among far-right circles and EU-critical politicians, falsely claims that chitin in insects is poisonous or carcinogenic; however, researchers have confirmed that food authority-approved insects are safe for consumption.  Despite rumors that the EU is attempting to trick the public into eating insects, current EU regulations require that approved insects (such as migratory locusts, mealworms, and crickets) used in food be clearly listed on product labels under novel food regulations.";The fact-check paper addresses a complex set of claims surrounding edible insects, conspiracy theories, and their promotion by international organizations. The paper debunks several core assertions made by those spreading misinformation about insects, while confirming that the promotion of insects by organizations like the UN and WEF is a real occurrence that fuels these conspiracy theories. The paper provides the following verdict: False (regarding specific claims about insects and related conspiracy theories) The fact-check clearly refutes the central claims that:  Insects approved for consumption are poisonous or carcinogenic due to chitin.  The EU is attempting to trick the population into eating insects without labeling. The paper also confirms that conspiracy theories linking edible insects to an eco-dictatorship or New World Order are widespread, particularly fueled by the WEF's endorsement of insects, but it classifies these theories as parallels to existing conspiracy narratives (like The Great Reset) rather than factual claims.;EU and WEF Not Forcing People to Eat Insects as Part of 'New World Order';Edible insects are being promoted as a sustainable food source due to their high protein content and low CO2 emissions, but have been linked to conspiracy theories about a new world order and eco-dictatorship. Claims that insects are poisonous and carcinogenic due to chitin in their exoskeletons have been rejected by researchers, and EU regulations require risk assessment and labeling for insect-based foods. The World Economic Forum's promotion of insects as a food source has fueled conspiracy theories, but there is no evidence to support claims that the EU or WEF want to force people to eat insects. Meta AI response: Here are three bullet points summarizing the fact-check: Edible insects are being promoted as a sustainable food source due to their high protein content and low CO2 emissions, but have been linked to conspiracy theories about a new world order and eco-dictatorship. Claims that insects are poisonous and carcinogenic due to chitin in their exoskeletons have been rejected by researchers, and EU regulations require risk assessment and labeling for insect-based foods. The World Economic Forum's promotion of insects as a food source has fueled conspiracy theories, but there is no evidence to support claims that the EU or WEF want to force people to eat insects.;Based on the fact-check, the verdict would be False for the specific claims that: Insects are poisonous and carcinogenic due to chitin The EU or WEF want to force people to eat insects The fact-check indicates that these claims are unfounded and rejected by researchers, and that EU regulations require labeling and risk assessment for insect-based foods. However, it's worth noting that some of the underlying information about the World Economic Forum and the EU promoting insects as a food source is true. But the conspiracy theories surrounding it are false. If we had to categorize the overall verdict, it would be Mostly False due to the misleading and unfounded nature of the claims.;Conspiracy Claims Linking Edible Insects to Global Control Plot Deemed False;Conspiracy Theories Surrounding Edible Insects: Edible insects, promoted as sustainable protein sources by organizations like the UN and World Economic Forum, have become targets of conspiracy theories, falsely linked to a supposed elite-driven new world order or eco-dictatorship aiming to control food choices, often tied to theories like The Great Reset. - Misinformation on Insect Safety: Claims circulating on social media, such as insects being poisonous or carcinogenic due to chitin in their exoskeletons, have been debunked by researchers, with four insect types (locust, mealworm, cricket, and buffalo worm) approved as safe novel foods by the EU after rigorous risk assessments. - Political and Social Resistance: Far-right European politicians and groups, including Matteo Salvini, Thierry Baudet, and Nigel Farage, have opposed edible insects, framing them as an EU-imposed agenda, despite regulations requiring clear labeling of insect-containing foods, countering claims of deceptive practices.;The verdict of the fact-check is False. The claims that edible insects are part of an elite-driven conspiracy to impose a new world order or eco-dictatorship, are poisonous, or are being deceptively introduced into food without proper labeling are not supported by evidence. Researchers have debunked claims about insect toxicity, and EU regulations ensure clear labeling of insect-containing foods. The conspiracy theories linking insects to global control agendas like The Great Reset lack credible evidence and are rooted in misinformation.

Conspiracy theories are often fueled when the World Economic Forum holds its annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland. Photo: Fabrice Coffrini;Ask-me-anything;Fact-Check: False Claim That Edible Insects Are Toxic and Part of Globalist Control Agenda;1. Claim being verified: That edible insects are being pushed by global elites (such as the UN and World Economic Forum) as part of a conspiracy to impose a global eco-dictatorship, and that insects are dangerous to human health—specifically due to the substance chitin, which is claimed to be carcinogenic. 2. Main evidence used:  Scientific assessments by food authorities, including the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), which have approved several insect species as safe for consumption.  Expert input from researchers like Rikke Peters, who link the rise in insect-related conspiracies to broader fears of elite control.  Disinformation traced to social media posts, far-right political figures, and conspiracy-promoting blogs/media (e.g., Danmark Vågner, Compact, Rob Schneider), which falsely claim that chitin is toxic or that insect consumption is being secretly forced upon the population. 3. Verdict: False. The claim that insects are poisonous or being secretly forced on the public as part of a globalist conspiracy is unfounded. Approved insects are safe to eat according to EU regulations, and product labeling is required when insects are included. The conspiracy narrative stems from misinformation and ideological opposition to climate and sustainability efforts.;Here is the verdict of the fact-check based on your requested structure: 1. What is the claim being verified? That edible insects are toxic (due to the substance chitin) and are being promoted by global elites (such as the UN and World Economic Forum) as part of a secret plan to impose a global eco-dictatorship and control food choices. 2. What is the final verdict? False. 3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict?  Scientific evidence: Researchers and food safety authorities (e.g., EFSA) confirm that approved edible insects are safe for human consumption, and the claim that chitin is carcinogenic is unsupported by scientific research.  Regulatory transparency: Insects used in food within the EU must be clearly labeled, and only species approved through risk assessments are allowed.  Contextual analysis: Experts link the rise of this conspiracy theory to broader disinformation trends involving mistrust of elites, climate policies, and EU regulation. The claim emerges from far-right and conspiracy-driven sources rather than credible evidence.;Fact Check: Conspiracy Claims Linking Edible Insects to WEF Eco-Dictatorship and Poisoning Are False;The fact-check verifies the claim that edible insects are part of an international elite's plot (specifically involving the UN and the World Economic Forum) to impose a new world order or eco-dictatorship by forcing or tricking the population into eating them. This includes the specific accusation that insects are poisonous due to the substance chitin, and that the EU is trying to hide insect ingredients in food. - Main Evidence Used: The fact-check utilizes evidence from various sources to address the claims: - It confirms that the UN (FAO) and the World Economic Forum do promote edible insects for their nutritional value and sustainability (low CO2 emissions compared to cattle), aligning with climate goals. - It cites researchers who have denied the claim that insects approved by food authorities are poisonous, specifically refuting the allegation regarding chitin. - It references EU regulations for novel foods, noting that insects must undergo risk assessment by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and approval by the EU Commission. - It confirms that EU and Danish regulations require that the presence of insects in food products must be clearly stated on the product label. - Verdict and Key Reasons: The verdict is False regarding the conspiracy claims. While the fact-check confirms that organizations like the WEF and the UN endorse edible insects for legitimate climate and sustainability reasons, it refutes the conspiratorial interpretations. Researchers deny the claim that approved edible insects are poisonous, and the conspiracy that the EU is tricking consumers is false because EU law mandates clear labeling of insect ingredients on food products.;Based on the provided fact-check paper, here is the verdict: 1. What is the claim being verified? The fact-check is verifying the claim, prevalent in social media and among certain political circles, that edible insects are part of a conspiracy by international elites (such as the World Economic Forum and the UN) to impose an eco-dictatorship, poison the population through the substance chitin, or trick people into eating insects as part of a Great Reset agenda. 2. What is the final verdict (True/False/Mixed)? False. 3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict? The verdict is false because:  While organizations like the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Economic Forum do endorse edible insects, they do so based on recognized benefits regarding nutrition and sustainability, citing that insect production emits significantly less CO2 than traditional livestock.  The claim that approved insects are poisonous due to chitin is directly refuted by researchers cited in the fact-check.  The conspiracy that the EU is attempting to trick the population into eating insects is contradicted by mandatory EU regulations. Edible insects are classified as novel foods that must be risk-assessed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and approved by the EU Commission. Furthermore, EU regulations require that the presence of insects in food products must be clearly and specifically stated on the product label.;False Claim: Edible Insects Not Part of Sinister Plot to Impose New World Order;Claim being verified: The claim being verified is that edible insects are part of an international elite's plan to introduce a new world order, and that organizations like the World Economic Forum and the UN are promoting insects as food to impose an eco-dictatorship and force people to eat insects. Main evidence used to support or refute the claim: The main evidence used to refute the claim includes: Research from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the EU's regulations on novel foods, which show that edible insects are subject to risk assessment and approval before being marketed in the EU. Statements from researchers and experts, who deny that approved edible insects are poisonous or carcinogenic. EU labeling requirements, which mandate that foods containing insects must be labeled with the insect's name. Verdict and key reasons: The verdict is False. The key reasons behind this verdict are: The claims about edible insects being part of a plan to impose a new world order or eco-dictatorship are unfounded and lack evidence. The promotion of insects as food by organizations like the World Economic Forum and the UN is based on their nutritional and environmental benefits, not a sinister plot.

Final verdict: False Evidence or reasoning supporting the verdict: The evidence and reasoning that support this verdict include: Lack of credible evidence to support the claim of a sinister plot by international organizations to force people to eat insects. Expert opinions and research from reputable sources, such as the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), that contradict claims about the toxicity or carcinogenicity of approved edible insects. EU regulations that require risk assessment and labeling of insect-containing foods, which contradicts claims of a secret plan to sneak insects into food. The promotion of insects as food by organizations like the World Economic Forum and the UN is based on their nutritional and environmental benefits, which is a legitimate and evidence-based reason.;Debunked: No Evidence for Conspiracy Linking Edible Insects to Global Eco-Dictatorship;Claim being verified: Edible insects are part of a conspiracy by an international elite, including the World Economic Forum and the UN, to impose a global eco-dictatorship, force people to eat insects, and introduce a new world order, with claims that insect chitin is poisonous and carcinogenic. - Main evidence used: The fact-check cites researchers denying that approved edible insects are poisonous or carcinogenic, refuting claims about chitin. It notes that the UN and World Economic Forum promote insects for their nutritional and environmental benefits, not as part of a conspiracy. EU regulations require insect-containing foods to be labeled and approved by the European Food Safety Authority, countering claims of deception. Conspiracy theories link insects to Agenda 21 and The Great Reset, but these are baseless narratives often tied to far-right sources like the German media Compact and the blog Danmark Vågner. - Verdict and key reasons: The verdict is false. The claims are rooted in conspiracy theories without evidence, misrepresenting the promotion of insects as a sustainable food source by reputable organizations. Scientific evidence confirms the safety of approved insects, and EU labeling requirements ensure transparency, debunking the notion of a hidden agenda to force insect consumption.;Claim being verified: Edible insects are part of a conspiracy by an international elite, including the World Economic Forum and the UN, to impose a global eco-dictatorship, force people to eat insects, and establish a new world order, with additional claims that insect chitin is poisonous and carcinogenic. - Final verdict: False. - Evidence or reasoning supporting the verdict: Researchers have refuted claims that approved edible insects are poisonous or that chitin is carcinogenic. The UN and World Economic Forum promote insects for their nutritional and environmental benefits, not as part of a conspiracy. EU regulations ensure that insect-containing foods are labeled and approved by the European Food Safety Authority, countering claims of deception. The conspiracy theories linking insects to Agenda 21 and The Great Reset originate from baseless narratives, often amplified by far-right sources like the German media Compact and the blog Danmark Vågner, without credible evidence.

Photo: Fabrice Coffrini;Chain-of-Thought;Claim That Elites Are Forcing Poisonous Insects Into Food Supply Is False, Fact-Check Confirms;Claim Being Evaluated: The conspiracy theory claims that edible insects are poisonous (due to chitin), are being promoted by elites like the UN and the World Economic Forum (WEF) as part of a plan to impose a global “eco-dictatorship,” and that people are being secretly forced to consume them.  Evidence Assessed: The fact-check refers to scientific research and statements from food authorities, including the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), which show that insects approved for consumption are not poisonous. Chitin, a component in insect exoskeletons, is not shown to be carcinogenic in approved doses. It also explains that insect-based foods must be clearly labeled under EU law.  Fact-Check Verdict: The conspiracy claims are false. Insects are promoted for their climate and nutritional benefits, not as part of a secret agenda. Scientific authorities have deemed them safe for consumption, and the claim about chitin being cancer-causing is unfounded. Furthermore, EU regulations ensure transparency in food labeling, contradicting the idea of hidden insect content in food.; Verdict: False  1. Claim Being Evaluated The claim states that edible insects are poisonous due to the substance chitin, and that global elites such as the UN and the World Economic Forum (WEF) are using insect-based food as part of a conspiracy to impose a global eco-dictatorship, secretly forcing the public to consume insects.  2. Key Evidence Reviewed  Safety of Insects: The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has assessed and approved several types of edible insects, confirming they are safe for human consumption.  Chitin: Claims that chitin is carcinogenic or toxic are not supported by scientific evidence. Experts have rejected the idea that chitin in edible insects is harmful in approved amounts.  Regulations & Transparency: EU regulations require clear labeling when insects are used in food products, contradicting claims of secret or hidden inclusion.  Role of UN and WEF: These organizations promote insects as sustainable food sources to address climate change and food insecurity, not as part of a coercive or conspiratorial agenda.  3. Conclusion & Justification The claim is false. The idea that edible insects are poisonous and part of a hidden plan by elites to control or deceive the public is unsupported by scientific evidence and contradicted by regulatory practices. Conspiracy narratives distort legitimate environmental and food policy efforts into misleading and unfounded theories.;Fact Check: Claims That Edible Insects Are Poisonous and Part of a WEF Great Reset Are False;This fact-check investigates the claim that edible insects are part of a conspiracy by international elites, particularly the World Economic Forum (WEF), to impose an eco-dictatorship and force people to consume insects against their will. Here is a summary of the fact-check paper:  Claim under evaluation: The fact-check addresses the claim circulating on social media and among some politicians that edible insects are part of an elite conspiracy (often linked to the UN and WEF's The Great Reset or Agenda 21) to impose an eco-dictatorship and force populations to eat insects, which are also falsely claimed to be poisonous or carcinogenic.  Evidence and analysis: The paper highlights that while organizations like the UN's FAO and the WEF do promote insects for their nutritional and environmental benefits (lower CO2 emissions, high protein), this endorsement has made them targets for existing conspiracy theories that view these organizations as attempting to establish a global socialist dictatorship. The claim that insects are poisonous due to chitin is explicitly rejected by researchers. Furthermore, the fact-check confirms that edible insects in the EU are subject to strict regulations (Novel Food rules) and must be approved by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).  Verdict and conclusion: The fact-check finds the central conspiracy claim to be false. While the WEF's endorsement of insects has indeed fueled conspiratorial narratives about forced consumption and eco-dictatorship, the claim that insects are poisonous is rejected by researchers. Additionally, contrary to rumors spread by figures like Nigel Farage, EU regulations require clear labeling of food products containing insects, meaning consumers are not being tricked into eating them.;Verdict: False The claim that edible insects are part of an international elite's plan to introduce a new world order, impose an eco-dictatorship, and force populations to consume them is false. Justification: The provided fact-check paper examines the origins and proliferation of these conspiracy theories, which primarily circulate on social media and among certain political groups. While organizations like the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Economic Forum (WEF) do promote edible insects as a sustainable and nutritious food source, the fact-check clarifies that this advocacy is based on recognized climate benefits (e.g., lower CO2 emissions compared to cattle) and nutritional value. The claim that insects are a tool for a socialist takeover or eco-dictatorship is an interpretation applied to these organizations' efforts by existing conspiracy theories, such as The Great Reset and Agenda 21. Furthermore, the specific claim that edible insects are poisonous or carcinogenic due to the substance chitin in their exoskeletons is explicitly refuted by researchers cited in the paper. Insects approved for consumption within the EU must undergo rigorous risk assessment by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and approval by the EU Commission under Novel Food regulations. Crucially, the fact-check confirms that EU regulations require clear and mandatory labeling of all food products containing insects, disproving the rumor that the population is being tricked into consuming them.;Claim About World Economic Forum Forcing Insect Consumption Debunked;The claim being evaluated is that edible insects are part of an international elite's plan to introduce a new world order, with some conspiracy theorists linking them to figures like Bill Gates and the World Economic Forum.The evidence provided includes expert insights from Rikke Peters, an associate professor and researcher into conspiracy theories, who notes parallels between this claim and existing conspiracy theories about eco-dictatorship. Additionally, the fact-check highlights the actual benefits of edible insects, such as their high protein content and low CO2 emissions, as recognized by international organizations like the UN and the World Economic Forum.The verdict is that the claim appears to be unfounded, with the association between edible insects and a new world order seeming to stem from fear and misinformation rather than fact. The fact-check suggests that the promotion of edible insects by international organizations is genuinely driven by concerns about climate change, sustainability, and hunger, rather than a sinister plot.;Verdict: False The claim being evaluated is that edible insects, promoted by organizations like the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the UN, are part of an international elite's plan to introduce a new world order and impose eco-dictatorship by forcing people to eat insects. Key evidence provided includes: The WEF and UN promote edible insects due to their nutritional value and sustainability, not as part of a sinister plot. EU regulations require clear labeling of insect-based foods, contradicting claims of a secretive agenda. Researchers have rejected claims about the carcinogenic properties of chitin in insects. Edible insects have been consumed in various cultures and are approved by food authorities. This evidence suggests that the claim is False, as it appears to be a conspiracy theory with no basis in fact. The promotion of edible insects is driven by legitimate concerns about climate change, sustainability, and food security, rather than a plot to control the population.;No Conspiracy: Edible Insects Are Safe and Not Part of a Global Eco-Dictatorship, Fact-Check Confirms;Claim Evaluated: The fact-check investigates the claim that edible insects, promoted as a sustainable food source, are part of a conspiracy by an international elite (linked to the UN and World Economic Forum) to impose a new world order or eco-dictatorship, forcing people to eat insects. Additional claims include insects being poisonous and containing carcinogenic chitin. - Main Evidence: The fact-check cites Rikke Peters, a conspiracy theory researcher, who notes parallels between insect-related conspiracies and existing theories like Agenda 21 and The Great Reset, which falsely allege global socialist control. Scientific evidence from the National Food Institute at the Technical University of Denmark shows insect production emits significantly less CO2 than cattle, supporting their environmental benefits. The UN and World Economic Forum promote insects for their nutritional and sustainability benefits. Claims about chitin being carcinogenic are debunked by researchers contacted by TjekDet, and EU regulations require insect-containing foods to be clearly labeled, countering claims of deception. - Verdict: The claims are false. The conspiracy theories linking edible insects to a global elite takeover lack evidence and stem from misinterpretations of legitimate endorsements by organizations like the UN and WEF. The assertion that insects are poisonous or carcinogenic is contradicted by scientific research, and EU labeling requirements ensure transparency, debunking claims of covert inclusion in food.;Verdict: False 1. Claim: Edible insects are part of a conspiracy by an international elite, linked to the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the UN, to impose a global eco-dictatorship and force people to eat insects as part of a socialist takeover, with additional claims that insect chitin is poisonous and carcinogenic. 2. Key Evidence: - Researchers consulted by TjekDet refute the claim that chitin in approved edible insects is poisonous or carcinogenic, confirming the safety of insects approved by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). - The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization and the WEF promote edible insects for their high protein content and low CO2 emissions (100 times less than cattle), as a sustainable solution to hunger and environmental concerns. - EU regulations require risk assessments for novel foods like insects and mandate clear labeling of insect ingredients, countering claims of deceptive practices. - Conspiracy theories like Agenda 21 and The Great Reset, which allege global control schemes, are baseless and misrepresent the WEF and UN’s advocacy for sustainable food practices. - Social media posts, including those from Danmark Vågner and shared by figures like Rob Schneider, rely on misinformation, such as the false chitin claim, and are linked to far-right sources like the German media Compact. 3. Justification: The claim is false because no evidence supports the existence of a conspiracy to impose an eco-dictatorship or force insect consumption. The safety of approved edible insects is backed by scientific assessments, and their promotion by reputable organizations is driven by environmental and nutritional benefits, not a socialist agenda. Claims about chitin’s toxicity are debunked by researchers, and EU labeling requirements ensure transparency, contradicting accusations of deceit. The narrative aligns with known conspiracy theories lacking credible evidence.
FC_05;Bullet point summary;Insects are a new ingredient in the stew of conspiracy theories;Edible insects are being touted as a win for both the climate and the environment. But the insects are provoking the anger of both conspiracy theorists and far-right politicians.;Here is the fact-check paper:A new type of food is slowly creeping into the company of 5G technology and corona vaccines. On social media, in alternative online media and among European politicians on the far right, there is a particular aversion to edible insects.Not only are insects, which fall under the category of novel food, called unappetizing, they are also seen in corners of the internet as part of an international elite's plan to introduce a new world order.Rikke Peters, an associate professor at UCL Business Academy and researcher into conspiracy theories, is new to the idea that edible insects have become a topic in conspiracy circles. But she is not the least bit surprised:“I see several parallels to existing conspiracy theories. The edible insects tap into a fear that an elite will impose some kind of eco-dictatorship and take away our individual food choices,” she says.But how did insects end up in cahoots with people like Bill Gates, and why are they interpreted as part of a socialist takeover of the world?Multi-faceted climate benefitInsects have attracted great interest as a food source because advocates have recognized that they contain large amounts of protein and are therefore suitable as both food and animal feed. Among the more popular edible insects are species such as the grasshopper, mealworm and cricket, and their production emits far less CO2 than the animals we normally eat. According to the National Food Institute at the Technical University of Denmark, for example, the production of cattle emits 100 times more greenhouse gases than the production of edible insects.Among those who care about climate and the environment, we find international organizations such as the UN and the World Economic Forum. The UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) praises insects for being nutritious , sustainable and cheap, and thus a tool to end hunger and help developing countries in a sustainable way. For much the same reason, the World Economic Forum also promotes eating insects . The organization brings together world leaders and other leaders once a year for a meeting in the Swiss mountain town of Davos, where climate change is often part of the agenda.CheckedFrench President Emmanuel Macron shakes hands with World Economic Forum Chairman Klaus Schwab. Conspiracy theories are often fueled when the World Economic Forum holds its annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland. Photo: Fabrice Coffrini;Contextual;Fact-Check: Claims That Edible Insects Are Poisonous and Part of a Global Conspiracy Are False;The claim: A conspiracy theory suggests that edible insects are being promoted by global elites (e.g., the UN, World Economic Forum, Bill Gates) as part of a hidden agenda to impose a global eco-dictatorship, remove personal food choices, and even poison the population. It is also claimed that insects contain carcinogenic substances like chitin.  The evidence: Researchers and food safety authorities (such as the European Food Safety Authority and Denmark’s National Food Institute) confirm that insects approved for food in the EU are safe and not poisonous. Chitin, while indigestible, is not proven to be carcinogenic. The conspiracy narratives have been traced to far-right sources and influencers, such as Danish blog Danmark Vågner, actor Rob Schneider, and the German outlet Compact.  The verdict: False. The claim that edible insects are dangerous or part of a conspiratorial global agenda is unfounded. Approved insects are safe to eat under EU regulations, and labels must clearly state their presence in food products.;1. What is the claim being assessed? The claim is that edible insects are part of a conspiracy by global elites (such as the UN and World Economic Forum) to impose an eco-dictatorship by forcing people to eat insects, which are portrayed as poisonous and carcinogenic, as part of a plan to control or harm the population. 2. What is the verdict? False. 3. What reasoning or evidence supports this decision? The fact-check shows that edible insects approved for consumption by the EU have undergone rigorous safety assessments and are considered safe and nutritious. The claim that insects contain carcinogenic substances like chitin is rejected by researchers. The conspiracy theories linking insects to a global elite agenda originate from far-right and discredited sources and lack credible evidence. Moreover, food labeling laws require insects to be clearly identified on product packaging, countering claims of hidden agendas.;False: Edible Insects Are Not Part of a Global Elite's Plot to Force Consumption or Poison the Public;The Claim: The fact-check examines the claim circulating on social media and among some far-right politicians that edible insects are part of an international elite's plot (often linked to the World Economic Forum's 'The Great Reset' or the UN's 'Agenda 21') to impose an eco-dictatorship and force people to eat insects against their will. Furthermore, some variations of this claim assert that the substance chitin, found in insect exoskeletons, is poisonous and carcinogenic.  The Evidence: The paper presents evidence that while organizations like the UN's FAO and the World Economic Forum do promote insects as a sustainable, nutritious, and climate-friendly food source, this endorsement has become a target for conspiracy theories. Researchers cited by TjekDet deny the claims that approved edible insects are poisonous or that chitin is carcinogenic. Additionally, the fact-check clarifies that edible insects are subject to strict EU Novel Food regulations, which require risk assessment and approval by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), and contrary to some claims, EU legislation mandates that the presence of insects in food must be clearly stated on the product label.  The Verdict: The fact-check refutes the core conspiratorial claims. While the World Economic Forum and UN do promote edible insects for sustainability reasons, the claims that chitin is poisonous/carcinogenic and that there is a secret plot to force people to eat insects without their knowledge are false. The presence of insects in food in the EU is regulated and must be disclosed on packaging.;This fact-check paper examines a multifaceted conspiracy theory surrounding the consumption of edible insects. 1. What is the claim being assessed? The claim being assessed is that edible insects are part of a scheme orchestrated by an international elite, including organizations like the World Economic Forum and the UN, to introduce a new world order or eco-dictatorship. This conspiracy theory asserts that these organizations intend to take away individual food choices and force the population to consume insects, often claiming that insects are poisonous or that the substance chitin in their exoskeletons is carcinogenic and indigestible. 2. What is the verdict (true/false/mixed/other relevant verdict category)? False. 3. What reasoning or evidence supports this decision? The fact-check provides the following evidence to refute the claims:  No Evidence of Forced Consumption/Eco-dictatorship: While the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Economic Forum do promote insects as a sustainable, nutritious, and cost-effective food source to address climate change and hunger, the paper finds no evidence that these organizations are planning to impose an eco-dictatorship or force people to eat insects. Associate professor Rikke Peters notes that the WEF's endorsement is simply being linked to existing conspiracy theories like The Great Reset.  Chitin Toxicity Claims Refuted: The claim that insects, or the chitin within them, are poisonous or carcinogenic is explicitly denied by researchers cited in the fact-check. Edible insects approved for consumption are risk-assessed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and approved by the EU Commission.  Mandatory Labeling: The paper directly counters the rumor that the EU is attempting to trick the population into eating insects. It confirms that under EU regulations, it must be stated on the product label when foods contain insects, including the Danish or scientific name of the insect.;Claim that edible insects are part of a 'new world order' plot is FALSE;The claim: The claim being assessed is that edible insects are part of an international elite's plan to introduce a new world order, and that organizations like the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the EU are promoting insects as food to impose an eco-dictatorship and force people to eat them. The evidence: The evidence provided includes research from the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the WEF, which highlight the nutritional and environmental benefits of edible insects. Additionally, EU regulations for novel foods are cited, which require risk assessment and approval by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) before insects can be marketed in the EU. Four types of insects are currently approved for use in food in the EU. The verdict: The verdict is that the claim is false. Researchers have rejected the claim that insects approved by food authorities are poisonous, and the EU requires labeling of insect-containing foods. The promotion of edible insects by organizations like the WEF and FAO is based on their nutritional and environmental benefits, not a plot to impose a new world order. Meta AI response: Here is a concise summary of the key information in three bullet points: The claim: The claim being assessed is that edible insects are part of an international elite's plan to introduce a new world order, and that organizations like the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the EU are promoting insects as food to impose an eco-dictatorship and force people to eat them.

The promotion of edible insects by organizations like the WEF and FAO is based on their nutritional and environmental benefits, not a plot to impose a new world order.;Based on the fact-check, here is the final verdict: The claim being assessed: The claim being assessed is that edible insects are part of a sinister plot by international organizations like the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the EU to impose an eco-dictatorship and force people to eat insects as part of a new world order. The verdict: False Reasoning or evidence: The fact-check reveals that the claim is based on misinformation and conspiracy theories. The evidence shows that: The WEF and EU promote edible insects due to their nutritional and environmental benefits, not as part of a sinister plot. EU regulations require risk assessment and approval by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) before insects can be marketed in the EU, and labeling of insect-containing foods is mandatory. Researchers have rejected claims that approved edible insects are poisonous or carcinogenic. The spread of misinformation can be traced to far-right sources and conspiracy theorists. Overall, the claim is deemed false due to the lack of credible evidence supporting the sinister plot, and the presence of factual information highlighting the benefits and regulations surrounding edible insects.;Conspiracy Claim That Edible Insects Are Part of a Globalist Eco-Dictatorship Plot Is False;The Claim: Edible insects are part of a conspiracy by an international elite, including the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the UN, to impose a socialist eco-dictatorship and force people to eat insects as part of plans like The Great Reset or Agenda 21. Social media posts, particularly from far-right circles, also claim that insect chitin is poisonous and carcinogenic. - The Evidence: The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization and the WEF promote insects as a sustainable, protein-rich food source with low CO2 emissions compared to traditional livestock (e.g., cattle emit 100 times more greenhouse gases). EU regulations require novel foods like insects to be risk-assessed by the European Food Safety Authority, with four insect types approved for consumption. Researchers have refuted claims that approved insects are poisonous or carcinogenic. Social media posts linking insects to conspiracies often stem from sources like the far-right German media Compact and the blog Danmark Vågner, which echo debunked claims about chitin. - The Verdict: The claim is false. There is no evidence supporting the conspiracy that insects are part of a globalist plot to enforce a dictatorship or that approved insects are harmful. Scientific evidence and regulatory approvals confirm insects as safe and sustainable, while conspiracy theories misrepresent the intentions of organizations like the WEF and UN.;1. What is the claim being assessed? The claim asserts that edible insects are part of a conspiracy by an international elite, including the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the UN, to impose a socialist eco-dictatorship through plans like The Great Reset or Agenda 21, forcing people to eat insects. Additionally, social media posts, particularly from far-right circles, claim that chitin in insects’ exoskeletons is poisonous and carcinogenic. 2. What is the verdict? The verdict is false. 3. What reasoning or evidence supports this decision? The claim is unsupported by evidence and relies on conspiracy theories. The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization and the WEF promote insects as a sustainable, protein-rich food source with significantly lower CO2 emissions than traditional livestock (e.g., cattle produce 100 times more greenhouse gases). The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) rigorously assesses insects as novel foods, with four types approved for safe consumption in the EU. Researchers have explicitly debunked claims that chitin in approved insects is poisonous or carcinogenic. The conspiracy narrative, often amplified by far-right sources like the German media Compact and the blog Danmark Vågner, misrepresents the scientific and regulatory support for edible insects as part of a supposed globalist plot, with no credible evidence linking insects to eco-dictatorship or harmful health effects.

Photo: Fabrice Coffrini;Least-to-most ;Claim That Edible Insects Are Poisonous and Part of a Global Conspiracy Is False, Experts Confirm;1. Verdict: The claim is false. 2. Evidence:  Edible insects are nutritious, sustainable, and approved by authorities such as the EU after thorough risk assessments (EFSA and EU Commission).  Organizations like the UN’s FAO and the World Economic Forum promote insects as a climate-friendly, protein-rich food source.  Conspiracy theories link insects to a supposed elite-driven “eco-dictatorship” or “Great Reset,” but these are not based on scientific or regulatory facts.  Claims that insects contain carcinogenic chitin are refuted by researchers.  EU regulations require clear labeling if insects are included in food products, contradicting rumors that insects would be secretly forced upon consumers.  Political figures on the far right oppose edible insects, often using misinformation or conspiracy rhetoric, but this opposition lacks factual grounding. 3. Claim: The main claim being fact-checked is that edible insects are poisonous, carcinogenic, and part of a global elite’s plan to impose insect consumption on the public as a form of control or eco-dictatorship. --- Combined Summary: The claim that edible insects are poisonous, carcinogenic, and part of a secret elite plan to force people to eat them as a means of control is false. Scientific and regulatory bodies like the European Food Safety Authority and the EU Commission have approved certain insects as safe and nutritious novel foods, emphasizing their sustainability and climate benefits. International organizations such as the UN’s FAO and the World Economic Forum endorse edible insects for their environmental and nutritional advantages. The notion that insects contain carcinogenic substances like chitin has been debunked by researchers. Moreover, EU law mandates clear labeling on foods containing insects, countering conspiracy rumors about covert insect consumption. While some far-right politicians and conspiracy groups spread misinformation linking insects to dystopian agendas, these claims lack factual support and are largely driven by fear of an alleged eco-dictatorship rather than evidence.;"Here you go: 1. What is the claim being evaluated? The claim is that edible insects are poisonous and carcinogenic, and that their promotion as food is part of a global elite’s conspiracy to force insect consumption as a form of control or eco-dictatorship. 2. Based on the evidence provided, is the claim true, false, mixed or another verdict category? The claim is false. 3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict?  Scientific research and food safety authorities (EFSA, EU Commission) have approved certain edible insects as safe and nutritious.  The substance chitin in insects is not carcinogenic as claimed; researchers have refuted this.  Major international organizations like the UN’s FAO and the World Economic Forum promote edible insects for sustainability and nutrition, not as part of a conspiracy.  EU regulations require transparent labeling of insect ingredients, negating the idea of covert forced consumption.  Conspiracy theories linking insects to a global “Great Reset” or eco-dictatorship are based on misinformation and political rhetoric, not facts. --- Final Verdict: The claim that edible insects are poisonous, carcinogenic, and part of a global elite’s plan to impose insect consumption is false. Reliable scientific evidence and regulatory approvals confirm that edible insects are safe and sustainable food options, while the conspiracy theories lack factual basis.";No, Edible Insects Are Not Part of an Elite Conspiracy to Force an 'Eco-Dictatorship';"The fact-check paper examines the claim circulating on social media and among certain political groups that edible insects are part of a conspiracy by international elites, particularly the World Economic Forum (WEF), to impose an eco-dictatorship and force people to consume insects, which are also falsely claimed to be poisonous or carcinogenic. 1. Verdict: False. 2. Evidence: The fact-check refutes the core claims of the conspiracy theory.  WEF/UN Involvement: While the UN (FAO) and the WEF do promote edible insects as a sustainable, nutritious, and environmentally friendly food source (citing climate benefits like significantly lower CO2 emissions compared to cattle), this endorsement is interpreted by conspiracy theorists as evidence of a sinister plan (Agenda 21 or The Great Reset). The fact-check acknowledges the organizations' legitimate reasons for promoting insects but notes that their involvement fuels the conspiracy narratives.  Toxicity/Carcinogenicity: The claim that chitin in insect exoskeletons is poisonous or carcinogenic is explicitly denied by researchers mentioned in the text. Edible insects approved by the EU (like the migratory locust, mealworm, and cricket) are subject to rigorous risk assessment by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and approved by the EU Commission under novel food regulations.  EU Labeling: The claim that the EU is attempting to trick people into eating insects by hiding them on labels is false. The fact-check confirms that EU regulations require insects to be stated on the product label using their common name (e.g., in Danish) or Latin name, depending on the context, ensuring transparency for consumers. 3. Claim: The central claim is that international elites, notably the World Economic Forum (WEF), are conspiring to force the public to eat edible insects as part of a New World Order or eco-dictatorship, and that these insects are poisonous or carcinogenic. Summary: The claim that edible insects are part of a conspiracy by the World Economic Forum (WEF) and other international elites to impose an eco-dictatorship and force the population to consume insects—which are also falsely claimed to be poisonous—is False. While organizations like the UN and the WEF advocate for edible insects due to their nutritional value, sustainability, and lower environmental impact, this fact is co-opted by conspiracy theories like The Great Reset and Agenda 21 to suggest a sinister plan. Researchers cited in the fact-check explicitly deny the claims that insects approved for consumption contain carcinogenic or poisonous substances like chitin. Furthermore, the notion that the EU is secretly trying to trick people into eating insects is also debunked; EU regulations for novel foods mandate that the presence of insects must be clearly stated on product labels.";1. What is the claim being evaluated? The claim being evaluated is that edible insects are part of an international elite's plan (e.g., associated with the World Economic Forum and The Great Reset) to introduce a New World Order or eco-dictatorship by forcing the public to eat insects. This claim often includes the false assertion that insects are poisonous, specifically due to the substance chitin, and that the EU is attempting to trick consumers by hiding insects in food products. 2. Based on the evidence provided, is the claim true, false, mixed or another verdict category? Based on the evidence provided in the fact-check, the claim is False. 3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict? The fact-check demonstrates that the claims supporting the conspiracy theory are unfounded. While the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) do promote edible insects as a sustainable food source with significant climate benefits (e.g., lower CO2 emissions compared to traditional livestock) and nutritional value, this is presented as a legitimate interest, not a conspiracy to impose a new world order. The paper refutes the central premise that approved edible insects are poisonous or carcinogenic. Researchers explicitly denied the claim, often circulated by conspiracy theorists, that chitin in insect exoskeletons is harmful to humans. Furthermore, the fact-check clarifies that edible insects are subject to EU Novel Food regulations, requiring risk assessment by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and approval by the EU Commission. Contrary to claims that the EU attempts to hide insects in food, EU regulations mandate that the presence of insects must be clearly stated on product labels, ensuring transparency for consumers.;No, Eating Insects Isn't Part of a Plan for a New World Order;Verdict: The claim appears to be false, as researchers have denied that insects approved by food authorities are poisonous, and the EU requires labeling of insect-containing foods. Evidence: The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and EU regulations approve certain insects as novel foods after risk assessment. Researchers have rejected claims that chitin in insects causes cancer. The EU requires labeling of foods containing insects, contrary to claims that the EU wants to trick people into eating insects. Claim: The main claim being fact-checked appears to be that edible insects are part of an international elite's plan to introduce a new world order, and that organizations like the World Economic Forum and the EU are promoting insects as food to control people. Summary: The claim that edible insects are part of a plan by international elites to control people is false. Evidence from the EU's regulatory framework and researchers' assessments shows that approved insects are safe for consumption and subject to labeling requirements. While organizations like the World Economic Forum and the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization promote insects as a sustainable food source, this is due to their nutritional benefits and environmental advantages, not a plot for world domination.

The claim being evaluated appears to be that edible insects are part of a conspiracy by international elites, such as the World Economic Forum, to control people and impose a new world order, and that insects are somehow linked to 5G technology and COVID-19 vaccines. Based on the evidence provided, is the claim true, false, mixed or another verdict category? The claim is false. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict? The evidence supporting this verdict includes: Researchers have rejected claims that insects approved by food authorities are poisonous or cause cancer. The EU has a regulatory framework for approving novel foods, including insects, and requires labeling of foods containing insects. The World Economic Forum and other organizations promote edible insects due to their nutritional benefits and environmental advantages, not as part of a conspiracy. There is no credible evidence linking edible insects to 5G technology or COVID-19 vaccines. Final Verdict: The claim that edible insects are part of a conspiracy by international elites to control people and impose a new world order is FALSE. The evidence shows that edible insects are a legitimate food source being promoted for their nutritional and environmental benefits, and that claims of poison or conspiracy are unfounded.;Conspiracy Claim That Edible Insects Are Part of a Globalist Plot to Force Eco-Dictatorship Debunked as False;1. Verdict: The claim is false. The idea that edible insects are part of a conspiracy by an international elite to impose a new world order or eco-dictatorship is not supported by evidence. 2. Evidence: - Edible insects are promoted by organizations like the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Economic Forum (WEF) for their nutritional value, sustainability, and low CO2 emissions compared to traditional livestock (e.g., cattle production emits 100 times more greenhouse gases than insect production). - Claims that insects are poisonous or that chitin in their exoskeleton is carcinogenic have been refuted by researchers, as verified by TjekDet. - EU regulations require insects used in food to be risk-assessed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and approved by the EU Commission. Only four insect types are currently approved for use in the EU. - EU laws mandate clear labeling of insect-containing foods, countering claims that the EU is tricking people into consuming insects. - Conspiracy theories linking insects to Agenda 21 or The Great Reset are based on misinterpretations of the UN and WEF’s advocacy for sustainable food sources, not evidence of a globalist plot. 3. Claim: The main claim is that edible insects are part of an international elite’s plan (involving the UN, WEF, and figures like Bill Gates) to impose a new world order or eco-dictatorship, forcing people to eat insects as part of a socialist takeover, and that insects are poisonous or carcinogenic.  Cohesive Summary The fact-check investigates the claim that edible insects are part of a conspiracy by an international elite, including organizations like the UN and the World Economic Forum (WEF), to establish a new world order or eco-dictatorship, forcing people to consume insects as part of a socialist agenda, and that insects are poisonous or carcinogenic. The verdict is that this claim is false, as it lacks credible evidence and relies on misinterpretations and misinformation. Key evidence refuting the claim includes the scientific and regulatory backing for edible insects as a sustainable food source. The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization and the WEF promote insects like grasshoppers, mealworms, and crickets for their high protein content and significantly lower CO2 emissions compared to traditional livestock, such as cattle, which produce 100 times more greenhouse gases. Researchers have debunked social media claims, such as those alleging that chitin in insect exoskeletons is carcinogenic or poisonous, with TjekDet confirming that approved insects are safe for consumption. Additionally, EU regulations ensure that only four insect types are approved as novel foods after rigorous risk assessments by the European Food Safety Authority, and clear labeling is required on products containing insects, countering accusations of deception. The conspiracy theories linking insects to Agenda 21 or The Great Reset misinterpret the UN and WEF’s sustainability initiatives as evidence of a globalist plot, despite no supporting evidence. These theories are amplified by far-right figures and social media posts, including a viral claim from a Danish blog and a post shared by actor Rob Schneider, both of which were refuted. The evidence demonstrates that the promotion of edible insects is driven by environmental and nutritional benefits, not a conspiratorial agenda, leading to the conclusion that the claim is false.; Brief Answers 1. What is the claim being evaluated? The claim is that edible insects are part of an international elite’s plan (involving the UN, World Economic Forum, and figures like Bill Gates) to impose a new world order or eco-dictatorship, forcing people to eat insects as part of a socialist takeover, and that insects are poisonous or carcinogenic. 2. Based on the evidence provided, is the claim true, false, mixed, or another verdict category? The claim is false. 3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict? - The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Economic Forum promote edible insects for their nutritional value and sustainability, as they emit significantly less CO2 than traditional livestock (e.g., cattle produce 100 times more greenhouse gases). - Claims that insects are poisonous or that chitin in their exoskeleton is carcinogenic have been refuted by researchers, as verified by TjekDet. - EU regulations require rigorous risk assessments by the European Food Safety Authority for insects used as novel foods, with only four types approved, and clear labeling is mandated, countering claims of deception. - Conspiracy theories linking insects to Agenda 21 or The Great Reset misinterpret sustainability initiatives as a globalist plot, with no credible evidence supporting such claims.  Final Verdict The claim that edible insects are part of an international elite’s plan to impose a new world order or eco-dictatorship, forcing people to eat insects as part of a socialist takeover, and that insects are poisonous or carcinogenic, is false. The evidence shows that insects are promoted by organizations like the UN and WEF for their environmental and nutritional benefits, with cattle producing 100 times more greenhouse gases than insect production. Researchers have debunked claims about the toxicity or carcinogenicity of approved insects, and EU regulations ensure safety and transparency through risk assessments and mandatory labeling. Conspiracy theories linking insects to Agenda 21 or The Great Reset lack credible evidence and misinterpret sustainability efforts, confirming the claim’s falsehood.
FC_05;Bullet point summary;Insects are a new ingredient in the stew of conspiracy theories;Edible insects are being touted as a win for both the climate and the environment. But the insects are provoking the anger of both conspiracy theorists and far-right politicians.;Here is the fact-check paper:A new type of food is slowly creeping into the company of 5G technology and corona vaccines. On social media, in alternative online media and among European politicians on the far right, there is a particular aversion to edible insects.Not only are insects, which fall under the category of novel food, called unappetizing, they are also seen in corners of the internet as part of an international elite's plan to introduce a new world order.Rikke Peters, an associate professor at UCL Business Academy and researcher into conspiracy theories, is new to the idea that edible insects have become a topic in conspiracy circles. But she is not the least bit surprised:“I see several parallels to existing conspiracy theories. The edible insects tap into a fear that an elite will impose some kind of eco-dictatorship and take away our individual food choices,” she says.But how did insects end up in cahoots with people like Bill Gates, and why are they interpreted as part of a socialist takeover of the world?Multi-faceted climate benefitInsects have attracted great interest as a food source because advocates have recognized that they contain large amounts of protein and are therefore suitable as both food and animal feed. Among the more popular edible insects are species such as the grasshopper, mealworm and cricket, and their production emits far less CO2 than the animals we normally eat. According to the National Food Institute at the Technical University of Denmark, for example, the production of cattle emits 100 times more greenhouse gases than the production of edible insects.Among those who care about climate and the environment, we find international organizations such as the UN and the World Economic Forum. The UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) praises insects for being nutritious , sustainable and cheap, and thus a tool to end hunger and help developing countries in a sustainable way. For much the same reason, the World Economic Forum also promotes eating insects . The organization brings together world leaders and other leaders once a year for a meeting in the Swiss mountain town of Davos, where climate change is often part of the agenda.CheckedFrench President Emmanuel Macron shakes hands with World Economic Forum Chairman Klaus Schwab. Conspiracy theories are often fueled when the World Economic Forum holds its annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland. Photo: Fabrice Coffrini;Role;No, edible insects are not poisonous or part of a conspiracy to force people to eat them — experts confirm they are safe and regulated foods.;Claim: Edible insects are poisonous and carcinogenic due to chitin in their exoskeletons, and there is a plan by international elites (such as those connected to the World Economic Forum and the EU) to force people to eat insects as part of a global socialist or eco-dictatorship agenda. Evidence:  Researchers and food authorities have rejected the claim that edible insects approved for consumption are poisonous or carcinogenic.  Insects approved by the EU for food (e.g., locusts, mealworms, crickets) are subject to strict risk assessments by the European Food Safety Authority and labeling regulations requiring clear disclosure when insects are present in food.  The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Economic Forum promote edible insects due to their high protein content and low environmental impact, not as part of any conspiracy.  The conspiracy theory links edible insects to elite organizations like the World Economic Forum and interprets their endorsement as a push toward a Great Reset or eco-dictatorship.  The misinformation originates from dubious sources, including far-right media and social media posts, which mix factual promotion of insects as food with conspiratorial interpretations.  Political figures on the far right have echoed these conspiracies, but official regulations and scientific assessments contradict their claims. Verdict: False. The claim that edible insects are poisonous or carcinogenic and part of a forced global conspiracy to impose insect consumption is unsubstantiated. Scientific and regulatory bodies have approved certain insects as safe food, with clear labeling requirements, and the promotion of insects is based on sustainability and nutrition rather than any coercive agenda. The conspiracy theories misrepresent the facts and rely on unfounded fears.;1. Claim being assessed: Edible insects are poisonous and carcinogenic due to the substance chitin, and there is a conspiracy involving international elites (such as the World Economic Forum and the EU) to force people to eat insects as part of a global socialist or eco-dictatorship agenda. 2. Final verdict: False. 3. Explanation: The evidence shows that edible insects approved for human consumption have undergone thorough safety assessments by European food authorities and are not poisonous or carcinogenic. Scientific organizations like the UN and the World Economic Forum promote insects purely for their nutritional and environmental benefits. The conspiracy theories linking insect consumption to elite agendas rely on misinformation from far-right and social media sources, which misinterpret or distort these facts. Clear EU regulations mandate labeling of insect-containing foods, contradicting claims of secretive enforcement. Thus, the claim is not supported by credible evidence and is false.;Conspiracy Claims About Edible Insects Dismissed: No 'Eco-Dictatorship' Plot to Force Consumption;The provided fact-check paper examines the claim that international organizations and elites, particularly the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the UN, are conspiring to force the public to eat insects as part of a New World Order or eco-dictatorship, often linking this to broader conspiracy theories like The Great Reset and Agenda 21. Evidence Analysis:  Motivation for Promoting Insects: The fact-check acknowledges that organizations like the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the WEF do advocate for edible insects. They highlight insects as a sustainable, nutritious, and protein-rich food source with significant climate benefits (e.g., producing 100 times less greenhouse gas than cattle). The UN FAO views insects as a tool to end hunger and promote sustainable development.  Conspiracy Theory Origins and Parallels: Rikke Peters, a researcher on conspiracy theories, notes that the theories surrounding edible insects are fueled by existing fears of an eco-dictatorship imposed by an elite. The involvement of the WEF and the UN provides a target for these theories, similar to how they are central to theories concerning Agenda 21 and The Great Reset.  Specific Claims about Insects (Chitin): The fact-check addresses the claim that insects are poisonous due to chitin, which is alleged to be carcinogenic. Researchers cited by TjekDet have denied this, confirming that approved insects are not poisonous and that the claim originated from sources like the far-right German media outlet Compact and a viral social media post shared by figures like Rob Schneider.  EU Regulation and Transparency: The fact-check explains that edible insects in the EU are classified as novel food and must undergo rigorous risk assessment by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) before approval. Four specific types of insects are currently approved. Furthermore, contrary to claims by some politicians (like Nigel Farage) that the EU intends to trick consumers, EU and Danish regulations mandate that the presence and specific name of insects must be clearly stated on food product labels.  Political Opposition: The paper notes that EU-critical and right-wing populist politicians (e.g., Matteo Salvini, Thierry Baudet, Nigel Farage) have amplified the conspiracy theories by publicly opposing the consumption of insects and criticizing EU food legislation. Verdict: The claim that an international elite is attempting to force the population to eat insects is False. While international organizations like the WEF and UN do promote edible insects as a sustainable food source, the claim that this is part of a conspiracy to impose a new world order or eco-dictatorship is unsubstantiated. The fact-check debunks the specific health claims regarding insects being poisonous, confirms that EU-approved insects are safe, and clarifies that food regulations require transparent labeling of insect ingredients, refuting the idea that the public is being tricked.;1. What is the claim being assessed? The claim assessed is that edible insects are part of a conspiracy by international elites, specifically the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the UN, to establish a New World Order or eco-dictatorship by forcing the public to consume insects. This claim often includes allegations that insects are poisonous and are being secretly introduced into the food supply. 2. What is the final verdict? False. 3. Explain how the evidence supports the verdict in a clear and concise manner. The fact-check demonstrates that while organizations like the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the WEF do promote edible insects, their rationale is based on their recognized benefits as a sustainable, nutritious, and environmentally friendly food source. The paper refutes the specific allegations underpinning the conspiracy theories:  Toxicity Claims Debunked: The claim that the substance chitin in insects is poisonous or carcinogenic, as circulated on social media, has been explicitly denied by researchers. Insects approved by food authorities are deemed safe for consumption.  No Hidden Ingredients or Forced Consumption: The fact-check clarifies that edible insects in the EU undergo rigorous risk assessment by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and must be approved. Contrary to rumors spread by some politicians and social media users, EU regulations mandate that foods containing insects must be clearly labeled, refuting the notion that the public is being tricked into eating them. The conspiracy theory linking insect consumption to a forced eco-dictatorship is identified as an unfounded parallel to existing narratives such as The Great Reset and Agenda 21, fueled by a general fear of elites imposing restrictions on individual food choices, rather than being supported by verifiable evidence.;There's No Evidence Edible Insects Are Part of a Plot for a New World Order;Claim: Edible insects are part of an international elite's plan to introduce a new world order, and organizations like the World Economic Forum are promoting them as part of a plot to impose an eco-dictatorship and force people to eat insects. Evidence: The fact-check provides several key pieces of evidence to dispute this claim: The World Economic Forum and UN's Food and Agriculture Organization promote edible insects due to their nutritional value, sustainability, and potential to help developing countries, not as part of a sinister plot. EU regulations require risk assessment and approval for novel foods, including insects, and there are currently four approved types of insects for use in food. Researchers have denied claims that insects approved by food authorities are poisonous or carcinogenic. Product labels in the EU are required to state when foods contain insects. Verdict: Based on the evidence, the claim is false. The promotion of edible insects by organizations like the World Economic Forum is due to their potential environmental and nutritional benefits, not as part of a plot to control people. The EU has regulations in place to ensure the safety of novel foods, and labeling requirements provide transparency for consumers. Meta AI response: Here's a summary of the fact-check: Claim: Edible insects are part of an international elite's plan to introduce a new world order, and organizations like the World Economic Forum are promoting them as part of a plot to impose an eco-dictatorship and force people to eat insects.

Verdict: False Explanation: The evidence shows that the World Economic Forum and other organizations promote edible insects due to their nutritional value, sustainability, and potential to help developing countries. This aligns with their publicly stated goals and initiatives. There's no credible evidence to support the claim of a sinister plot. Additionally, EU regulations and labeling requirements for novel foods, including insects, contradict the claim of a forced imposition on the population. Researchers have also debunked claims about the toxicity and carcinogenic properties of approved edible insects. Overall, the evidence suggests that the claim is unfounded and driven by conspiracy theories rather than facts.;No, Edible Insects Aren’t a Global Conspiracy: Claims of Poisonous Bugs and Eco-Dictatorship Debunked as False;Claim: Edible insects are part of a conspiracy by global elites, including the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the UN, to impose a socialist eco-dictatorship and force people to eat insects, with some claiming insects are poisonous and carcinogenic due to chitin in their exoskeletons. Evidence: The fact-check highlights that edible insects, such as grasshoppers, mealworms, and crickets, are promoted by the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization and the WEF for their high protein content and low CO2 emissions compared to traditional livestock, which emits 100 times more greenhouse gases. These organizations see insects as a sustainable food source to address hunger and environmental concerns. However, conspiracy theories link insects to ideas like Agenda 21 and The Great Reset, alleging they are tools for a global socialist takeover. A viral social media post claimed that chitin in insects is indigestible and carcinogenic, but researchers have debunked this, confirming that insects approved by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) are safe. EU regulations require insect-containing foods to be clearly labeled, countering claims that the EU is tricking people into eating insects. Far-right politicians like Matteo Salvini, Thierry Baudet, and Nigel Farage have criticized insect consumption, fueling conspiracy narratives, but their claims misalign with evidence about labeling and safety. Verdict: False. The claim that edible insects are part of a conspiracy to enforce a socialist eco-dictatorship is baseless, rooted in misinterpretations of the WEF and UN’s sustainability efforts. The assertion that insects are poisonous or carcinogenic is also false, as approved insects are rigorously tested for safety, and EU labeling rules ensure transparency.;Claim: Edible insects are part of a conspiracy by global elites, including the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the UN, to impose a socialist eco-dictatorship and force people to eat insects, with some claims asserting that insects are poisonous and carcinogenic due to chitin in their exoskeletons. Verdict: False. Explanation: The evidence shows that the UN and WEF promote edible insects like grasshoppers and mealworms for their high protein and low CO2 emissions, supporting sustainability and food security, not a socialist takeover. The conspiracy theories linking insects to Agenda 21 or The Great Reset lack credible evidence and misrepresent these organizations’ goals. The claim about chitin being indigestible or carcinogenic is debunked by researchers, as insects approved by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) are safe for consumption.

Final verdict: False 3. Headline: “Fact-Check: Claims That Edible Insects Are Poisonous and Part of a Global Elite Conspiracy Are False”;Claim being evaluated: Edible insects are part of a conspiracy linked to an international elite or the World Economic Forum (WEF), aiming to impose an eco-dictatorship by forcing people to eat insects, which are allegedly poisonous and carcinogenic. Key evidence used to assess the claim:  Edible insects are promoted by credible organizations like the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the WEF for their nutritional value, sustainability, and low environmental impact compared to traditional livestock.  Production of edible insects emits significantly less greenhouse gases than cattle farming.  Edible insects approved as novel foods in the EU undergo risk assessment by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and must be clearly labeled on products.  Claims that insects contain carcinogenic substances like chitin have been rejected by researchers.  The conspiracy theory links insects to the WEF and global socialist agendas, but this stems from misinterpretations and fear of global initiatives like the Great Reset.  The conspiracy narrative is amplified by far-right groups and social media posts but lacks scientific support.  Political figures opposing the EU and its policies have used the insect-eating narrative as part of their rhetoric, often misleadingly. Verdict: False. Edible insects are safe and nutritious foods supported by scientific research and regulatory authorities. The conspiratorial claims about their dangers and political motives behind their promotion are unfounded and based on misinformation.;1. Claim being evaluated: Edible insects are poisonous, carcinogenic, and part of a conspiracy by elites such as the World Economic Forum to impose an eco-dictatorship by forcing people to eat insects. 2. Verdict: False. 3. Explanation: Scientific research and food authorities confirm that approved edible insects are safe, nutritious, and sustainable. The claim that insects contain carcinogenic substances like chitin is disproven. The conspiracy linking insects to a global elite’s plan is based on misinformation and fear, amplified by far-right groups and social media but lacks credible evidence. Regulatory bodies require clear labeling of insect-based foods, and their promotion is grounded in environmental and nutritional benefits, not political control.;Fact Check: Claims That Edible Insects Are Poisonous Or Part Of An Elite Global Takeover Plot Are False.;This fact-check paper examines the conspiracy theories surrounding the consumption of edible insects, which have proliferated on social media, alternative online media, and among far-right European politicians. The central claim being evaluated is that edible insects, often linked to international organizations like the UN and the World Economic Forum (WEF), are part of an elite plot to establish a new world order or eco-dictatorship, force the population to eat insects, and that these insects are potentially harmful or poisonous. Specifically, some claims allege that the chitin in insect exoskeletons is carcinogenic and indigestible. Key Evidence and Assessment: The fact-check assesses these claims using the following evidence:  Motivation for Eating Insects: Insects are promoted by international organizations (UN FAO, WEF) and climate advocates due to their high protein content, sustainability, and lower CO2 emissions compared to conventional livestock (e.g., cattle production emits 100 times more greenhouse gases).  Conspiracy Theory Parallels: Researcher Rikke Peters notes that the conspiracy theories around insects parallel existing fears of eco-dictatorship and the erosion of individual choice, often linking to broader theories like Agenda 21 and the WEF's The Great Reset. The WEF's promotion of insects is often cited as the kiss of death in conspiratorial circles, fueling these theories.  Safety and Regulation: The paper refutes the claim that approved edible insects are poisonous or that chitin is carcinogenic. Researchers cited by TjekDet deny these claims. In the EU, insects are categorized as novel food and must be risk-assessed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and approved by the EU Commission before marketing. Four specific insect types are currently approved for food use in the EU (Common migratory locust, mealworm larvae, domestic sheep chicken, and chicken weevil larvae).  Labeling Requirements: Contrary to rumors spread by figures like Nigel Farage, the EU mandates that food labels must clearly state when a product contains insects, ensuring transparency for consumers. Verdict: The fact-check finds that the claims linking edible insects to a harmful international conspiracy and arguing that approved insects are poisonous are false. The paper establishes that while international organizations promote insects for legitimate nutritional and environmental reasons, this endorsement has been co-opted by conspiracy theorists, particularly targeting the WEF and the EU. The claims regarding toxicity and secret introduction of insects into the food supply are unsubstantiated, contradicted by scientific evidence and EU food regulations.;The fact-check paper evaluates claims circulating on social media and among certain politicians regarding edible insects. 1. Claim being evaluated: The primary claims being evaluated are that edible insects are part of an international elite's plot (often linked to the World Economic Forum and the UN) to establish a new world order or eco-dictatorship and force populations to eat them. Specific allegations also include that insects are poisonous and that the substance chitin in their exoskeleton is carcinogenic and indigestible by humans. Additionally, the paper addresses the claim that the EU intends to trick the population into eating insects without proper labeling. 2. Verdict: False (regarding the conspiracy and toxicity claims). 3. Explanation: The fact-check provides evidence contradicting the core claims:  Toxicity and Carcinogenicity: The paper states that researchers have denied to TjekDet that insects approved by food authorities are poisonous and have rejected the claim that chitin causes cancer.  Regulation and Labeling: The paper clarifies that edible insects are subject to EU regulations for novel foods and must be risk-assessed and approved (currently 4 types are approved). It also directly refutes the claim that the EU is tricking consumers, stating that it must be stated on the product label when foods in the EU contain insects and that the Danish name of the insect must be stated if sold in Denmark.  Conspiracy: While the paper acknowledges that organizations like the UN and WEF promote insects for legitimate reasons (sustainability, nutrition), it characterizes the assertion that this is a forced global plot as a conspiracy theory, noting that these organizations play leading roles in broader theories like Agenda 21 and The Great Reset.;No, Eating Insects Isn't Part of a New World Order Plan.;Claim: Edible insects are part of an international elite's plan to introduce a new world order, and organizations like the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the UN are promoting them as part of a plot to impose eco-dictatorship and force people to eat insects. Key Evidence: The WEF and UN promote edible insects as a sustainable food source due to their high protein content and low CO2 emissions. EU regulations require risk assessment and approval for novel foods, including insects. Four types of insects are currently approved for use in food in the EU, and labeling is required if insects are present. Researchers have denied claims that approved edible insects are poisonous or carcinogenic. Social media posts and blogs spreading conspiracy theories about edible insects have been traced to far-right sources. Verdict: False. The evidence suggests that the promotion of edible insects is based on their nutritional and environmental benefits, and there is no credible evidence to support the claim that they are part of a conspiracy to impose a new world order or eco-dictatorship.;Claim: Edible insects are part of an international elite's plan to introduce a new world order, specifically linked to organizations like the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the UN promoting them as a food source to impose eco-dictatorship and force people to eat insects. Verdict: False.

FC_06;Assertion;Correct, but also a bit misleading about emissions cuts;AssertionDuring the last year of last year, the Labor Party government has cut as much as all the last governments under Ola Svenneby and my lifetime.Astrid Hoem. Youth Party Leader Debate, Arendal Week 2024, 14.08.2024 ConclusionThis is true if we refer to emissions per year, and take 1990 as the starting point compared to 2022 and 2023. Preliminary figures show that greenhouse gas emissions in Norway in 2023 were 4.7 percent lower than the previous year, and 9.1 percent lower than in 1990. In 2022, emissions were 4.6 percent lower than in 1990.;"This is the fact-check:Climate was one of the big topics when the youth party leaders met for a debate at Arendal Week. Among others, AUF's Astrid Hoem and Ola Svenneby from Unge Høyre met for a duel.With increasingly short speaking time, claims were made about whose government had built the most offshore wind turbines and who had cut greenhouse gas emissions the most.Astrid Hoem stated that the Conservative governments have performed poorly on climate, and made the following claim:– During the last year of last year, the Labor Party government has cut as much as all the last governments under Ola Svenneby and my lifetime.Later, the AUF leader repeated the claim that the Labour Party/Socialist Party government has cut more: – Now the numbers are very clear. We have cut as much in one year last year as has been cut during our entire lifetime of government terms. Read more fact checks from the youth party leadership debate:Outdated emission targets from Simen VelleThis shows the emissions figuresWhat do the actual emissions figures show, and is it true that as much was cut in one year in 2023 as under all the last governments in the lifetime of the youth politicians?In any case, it is true that the figures show a clear decrease in Norwegian greenhouse gas emissions in 2023.Statistics Norway's preliminary figures for Norwegian greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 show that greenhouse gas emissions in Norway decreased by 4.7 percent compared to the previous year. In total, emissions ended at 46.6 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalents , which was 2.3 million tonnes lower than in 2022. According to Statistics Norway, emissions decreased, among other things, because there was less activity in industry and fewer emissions from the oil and gas industry – and because Norwegians drove more electric cars.A decrease of 4.7 percent from 2022 to 2023 is greater than the percentage decrease between other individual years from 1990 to the present.If we look at the actual size of the emission cuts per year, there was only one year that had larger cuts: In 2009, emissions decreased by 2.5 million tons.Statistics Norway's figures for 2023 are preliminary, and it is expected that they will change somewhat when final figures are presented in November.– We therefore cannot yet say for sure that 2023 is the year with the largest decline in the time series, emphasizes Trude Melby Bothner, senior advisor at Statistics Norway, to Faktisk.no.9.1 percent down from 19902023 could therefore be the single year with the largest reduction, even though we are still far from the climate goals. But Hoem's statement can be interpreted as meaning that the cut in 2023 was as large as all other emissions cuts from various governments combined.When Faktisk.no contacts AUF and asks about the basis for the claim, they refer to developments since 1990. 1990 is often used as a reference year, because the climate goals and the Paris Agreement are based on this year.Greenhouse gas emissions in 2022 were 4.6 percent lower than in 1990. By 2023, the emission reduction had increased to 9.1 percent. It is therefore true that the cut in 2023 was approximately the same size as the emission cut between 1990 and 2022. But this way of calculating skips all the years between 1990 and 2022. If we look more closely at these years, the picture is more complex.Borgar Aamaas, senior researcher at the Cicero Center for Climate Research, believes that Hoem's statement is both correct and misleading . – If the point is to make it clear that the current government has pursued climate policies that have led to large emissions cuts versus previous governments that have not achieved this, these statements are very misleading, the climate scientist tells Faktisk.no.Climate measures in road traffic and oil and gas extraction, and lower activity in industry, contributed to the decline from 2022 to 2023, according to Statistics Norway. Photo: Tor Erik Schrøder / NTBA challenge with greenhouse gas emissions in Norway is that they increased from the starting year 1990 and stabilized in the 2000s with 2007 as the peak year, before gradually declining with an increasingly steep curve, the researcher explains.– With 1990 as the main year, it can be said that emissions have not decreased significantly, and that the decrease in 2023 is about the same as in 1990-2022.This is not the case if you start from other years. Hoem was born in 1995, and Svenneby in 1997:	Emissions in 1995 were only slightly above the 1990 level, and in that sense Hoem's analysis holds up, with a total decrease of 9.8 percent from 1995 to 2023, explains Aamaas.	In 1997 , emissions were somewhat higher. This gives a decrease of 14.6 percent from 1997 to 2023. Last year's cut will then be a smaller part of the total cut.The peak in emissions was in 2007. Since then, emissions have been reduced by 17.4 percent. Less than a quarter (23%) of this emission reduction came last year.– Thus, one can also argue that the emission reduction while the bourgeois government was in power between 2013-2021 was far greater than what has happened under the current government, based on the same statistics that Hoem has used, says Aamas.– But the current government has not been in office for that long, so it is not surprising that the cut so far is not that large, he adds.Borgar Aamaas is a researcher with a meteorology background at the Center for Climate Research, CICERO. Photo: Baard SalvesenAamaas points out that emissions are influenced by many factors over a long period of time – local and international politics, business and general societal trends that together explain emissions trends.– Furthermore, it can take a long time from when a policy is adopted and implemented until it has an impact on emissions statistics.An example of this is the electric car policy, which we can trace back to the 1990s, but where the effect of the policy has only become truly visible in recent years, the researcher points out.– Who then has the credit for the emissions cuts that are happening now? Similarly, the conservative side can argue that policies they implemented while they were in government are now showing up in the numbers and providing an additional emissions cut, says Aamaas.– The short version is that this is complicated, and it is not the case that any sitting government is fully responsible for emissions trends while they are in power.To summarize, Hoem's claim is correct under certain assumptions, but it is also a bit misleading.It is true that the cuts were as much in 2023 as between 1990 and 2022, but the cuts were more overall during Svenneby's lifetime or during Erna Solberg's government. Nor can the government necessarily take credit for the emissions going down on their watch.Astrid Hoem writes in an email to Faktisk.no that 1990 is the starting point in all climate debate when talking about climate cuts.– That is the reference year we use. It is a fact that the same amount of cuts were made in 2023 as was done from 1990 until then, she writes.– So I tried to say this in a somewhat funny way. The most important thing for me is that greenhouse gas emissions are cut, and it is no secret that AUF wants to speed things up even more.";Vanilla;Hoem’s Claim That 2023 Emissions Cut Equals All Previous Cuts Is Technically True, But Misleading;Assertion: AUF leader Astrid Hoem claimed that the Labour Party-led government cut as much greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 alone as all previous governments have done combined over the lifetimes of her and Unge Høyre’s Ola Svenneby. Specifically, she said the 2023 cut was as large as all the reductions from previous governments during their lifetime or since 1990. Conclusion: The fact-check finds the claim partly true but misleading. It is correct that the 2023 emissions cut (4.7%) is about the same size as the total cut from 1990 to 2022 (also around 4.6%). However, this interpretation ignores reductions that happened across individual years and under various governments, including more total reductions during the period of the Conservative-led government. Additionally, attributing the 2023 cut solely to the current government is overly simplistic, as emissions are influenced by long-term policies and external factors.;Verdict: Mixed The claim is factually correct in a narrow sense — the emissions cut in 2023 is approximately equal to the total reduction from 1990 to 2022. However, it is misleading because it oversimplifies a complex situation, omits relevant context about emissions trends and government policies over time, and implies that the current government alone is responsible for the 2023 reduction.;Fact Check: AUF's Climate Cut Claim is Mixed – 2023 Cuts Match 1990-2022, But Overall Progress and Government Credit are More Complex;Assertion: Astrid Hoem (AUF) claimed that the Labour Party government, in the single year 2023, cut as much in greenhouse gas emissions as all previous governments combined during the lifetime of youth politicians (Hoem born 1995, Svenneby born 1997). She reiterated that the numbers are very clear on this point. Conclusion: Hoem's claim is partially correct but misleading.  Partially Correct: It is true that the 2023 emission cut (4.7% or 2.3 million tonnes) was roughly equivalent to the net emission reduction between 1990 and 2022. This is because emissions increased for a significant period after 1990 before starting a downward trend. Therefore, when measured against the 1990 baseline, the 2023 cut effectively doubled the overall reduction achieved up to that point.  Misleading:  Single-year vs. Cumulative Cuts: While 2023 saw a significant single-year drop, it was not the largest ever (2009 saw a larger drop of 2.5 million tons). More importantly, the total cumulative cuts over the lifetime of the youth politicians (e.g., since 1995 for Hoem, or 1997 for Svenneby) or during the previous bourgeois government (2013-2021) were substantially larger than the 2023 cut alone. For example, since the peak in 2007, emissions have been reduced by 17.4%, with less than a quarter (23%) of that reduction occurring in 2023.  Government Credit: The fact-check emphasizes that attributing emission reductions solely to the sitting government is complex and often inaccurate. Emission trends are influenced by long-term policies (like electric car incentives dating back to the 1990s), economic activity, and global trends, with a significant time lag between policy implementation and visible effects. Therefore, the current government cannot take sole credit for the 2023 reduction, as policies enacted by previous governments likely contributed.;The verdict for the fact-check is Mixed.;AUF Leader's Claim on Record Climate Cuts: Partly Right, Partly Misleading;Assertion: Astrid Hoem, the leader of the Workers' Youth League (AUF), claimed that the Labor Party government cut greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 by as much as all previous governments combined during her lifetime and that of Ola Svenneby, a fellow politician. Conclusion: The fact-check concludes that Hoem's claim is both correct and misleading. According to Statistics Norway, the 4.7% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 is comparable to the total emission reduction between 1990 and 2022, which is a common reference year for climate goals. However, if you consider other time frames, such as the peak emission year of 2007 or the politicians' lifetimes, the picture becomes more complex. Emissions have decreased by 9.8% since Hoem's birth year (1995) and 14.6% since Svenneby's birth year (1997). Moreover, the current government may not be solely responsible for the emissions cuts, as policies implemented by previous governments can take time to show effects. Therefore, while Hoem's statement holds under certain assumptions, it can be misleading without additional context ¹.;Verdict: Mixed The claim is both correct and misleading, depending on the interpretation and context. According to the fact-check, Hoem's statement holds true when comparing the 2023 emission cuts to the total reduction since 1990, but it becomes misleading when considering other time frames or contexts, such as the politicians' lifetimes or the impact of previous governments' policies. Meta AI response: Verdict: Mixed The claim is both correct and misleading, depending on the interpretation and context. According to the fact-check, Hoem's statement holds true when comparing the 2023 emission cuts to the total reduction since 1990, but it becomes misleading when considering other time frames or contexts, such as the politicians' lifetimes or the impact of previous governments' policies.;AUF Leader’s Claim of 2023 Emission Cuts Matching Lifetime Reductions Is True but Misleading;Assertion Astrid Hoem, leader of AUF, claimed during a debate that the Labour Party/Socialist Party government in 2023 cut greenhouse gas emissions by as much as all previous governments combined during her and Ola Svenneby’s lifetimes, using 1990 as the reference year. Conclusion The claim is technically correct but misleading. According to Statistics Norway, greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 decreased by 4.7% (2.3 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalents) compared to 2022, roughly equivalent to the total reduction from 1990 to 2022 (4.6%). However, this comparison oversimplifies the emissions trend, as emissions increased until 2007 before declining. From 1995 (Hoem’s birth year), emissions fell by 9.8%, and from 1997 (Svenneby’s birth year), by 14.6%, with only about 23% of the reduction since the 2007 peak occurring in 2023. Additionally, emissions cuts are influenced by long-term policies and societal trends, not solely the actions of the current government. Thus, attributing the 2023 reduction entirely to the Labour Party/Socialist Party government is misleading, as previous policies, including those under Conservative governments, also contributed significantly.;Verdict: Mixed The claim is technically correct in that the 2023 greenhouse gas emission reduction (4.7%, or 2.3 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalents) matches the total reduction from 1990 to 2022 (4.6%). However, it is misleading because it oversimplifies the emissions trend, ignores increases until 2007, and attributes the 2023 cut solely to the current government, despite long-term policies and societal factors contributing significantly.

Preliminary figures show that greenhouse gas emissions in Norway in 2023 were 4.7 percent lower than the previous year, and 9.1 percent lower than in 1990.

Conclusion: Mixed. The claim is factually correct if using 1990 as the baseline — emissions were reduced by approximately 4.6% from 1990 to 2022, and a further 4.7% in 2023 alone. However, it is also misleading because:  It skips over the emissions trend between 1990 and 2022, which included periods of increase and stabilization.  More total emissions were cut during the conservative government's time in power (e.g., from 2007 or 2013 to 2021).  Current emissions cuts may be the result of long-term policies initiated by previous governments.  Government policies often take years to show effect, so attributing changes solely to the current administration is overly simplistic.;Verdict of the Fact-Check: 1. What is the claim being verified? AUF leader Astrid Hoem claimed that the Labour/Socialist government in 2023 cut as much greenhouse gas emissions in one year as all previous governments had done over the course of her and Ola Svenneby’s lifetime — or, put differently, that the 2023 cut was equal to the total emission reductions from 1990 to 2022. 2. What is the final verdict? Mixed. 3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict?  True under specific conditions: Statistics Norway’s preliminary data shows emissions were cut by 4.7% in 2023 — approximately the same as the total reduction from 1990 to 2022 (4.6%). So in that narrow context, the statement is factually correct.  Misleading due to context omission:  Emissions fluctuated between 1990 and 2022, with periods of increase and stabilization, not continuous decline.  Emissions cuts from 2007 (the peak year) or during the conservative government (2013–2021) were greater than in 2023 alone.  Many policies causing today’s reductions were implemented by earlier governments — including long-term initiatives like electric vehicle incentives.  Government impact on emissions is often delayed, making it overly simplistic to credit one administration for short-term changes. Therefore, while the numerical comparison is technically accurate, the broader context makes the claim misleading.;Climate Cuts Claim: Mostly True, But Misleading About Overall Impact;Assertion: Astrid Hoem (AUF) claimed that the Labour Party government, in the single year 2023, cut as much in greenhouse gas emissions as all previous governments combined during the lifetimes of herself and Ola Svenneby (Unge Høyre), or as much as was cut between 1990 and 2022. Conclusion: Mixed. While it is true that the 2023 emission cut (4.7%, or 2.3 million tonnes) was approximately the same size as the cumulative emission cut from 1990 to 2022 (which saw a 4.6% reduction), this interpretation is misleading. Emissions generally increased from 1990, peaked in 2007, and then began a gradual decline. The significant reduction in 2023 stands out as potentially the largest single-year cut (second only to 2009 by a small margin based on preliminary figures). However, when considering the entire period of the youth politicians' lifetimes (e.g., from Hoem's birth in 1995 or Svenneby's in 1997), or from the peak in 2007, or during the bourgeois government's term (2013-2021), the total emission reductions were far greater than just the 2023 cut. Furthermore, experts emphasize that emission trends are influenced by many factors over long periods, and no single government can solely take credit for cuts observed during their term, as policies implemented previously may just be showing their effect.;Here's the verdict of the fact-check: 1. What is the claim being verified? Astrid Hoem (AUF) claimed that the Labour Party government, in 2023 alone, cut as much in greenhouse gas emissions as all previous governments combined during the lifetimes of herself and Ola Svenneby (Unge Høyre), or specifically, as much as was cut between 1990 and 2022. 2. What is the final verdict (true/false/mixed)? Mixed. 3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict? The claim is partially true but misleading.  Truthful Aspect: It is accurate that the 2.3 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalents cut in 2023 (a 4.7% decrease from 2022) is approximately the same size as the total net reduction in emissions from 1990 to 2022 (which was 4.6%). This aligns with Hoem's statement if 1990 is taken as the sole reference point and only the net change up to 2022 is considered.  Misleading Aspect:  Excluding Intermediate Years: This calculation method skips all the years between 1990 and 2022 where emissions actually increased for a significant period, peaking in 2007.  Larger Overall Cuts: If other reference years are used (e.g., peak year 2007, or the start of the bourgeois government in 2013), the total emission reductions over those longer periods were substantially greater than the single year 2023 cut. For instance, from the 2007 peak, emissions have been reduced by 17.4%, with less than a quarter (23%) of that coming in 2023. The bourgeois government (2013-2021) oversaw much larger cuts than the current government has so far.  Causality: Experts highlight that emission trends are influenced by a multitude of factors over long periods, including policies implemented by previous governments (e.g., electric car policy traceable to the 1990s). Therefore, no single sitting government can claim sole credit for the emission reductions observed during their term.;AUF Leader's Claim of Record Emissions Cuts: Partly True, But Misleading in Context;Assertion: Astrid Hoem claimed that the Labor Party government has cut greenhouse gas emissions more than all previous governments combined, stating that they cut as much in one year (2023) as all previous governments under Ola Svenneby and her lifetime. Conclusion: The claim is both true and misleading. According to Statistics Norway, the 4.7% decrease in emissions from 2022 to 2023 is significant, and the cut in 2023 is approximately the same size as the emission cut between 1990 and 2022. However, the picture becomes more complex when considering other reference years, such as the peak emission year of 2007 or the politicians' birth years. Emissions have decreased by 9.1% since 1990, but the reduction since 2007 is 17.4%, with less than a quarter of this reduction coming from last year's cuts. Additionally, researcher Borgar Aamaas points out that attributing the emissions cuts solely to the current government is misleading, as emissions trends are influenced by many factors over time, including policies implemented by previous governments ¹.;Claim being verified: Astrid Hoem's claim that the Labor Party government cut greenhouse gas emissions by as much in one year (2023) as all previous governments combined during her lifetime and Ola Svenneby's lifetime. Final verdict: Mixed (both true and misleading). Evidence or reasoning: The claim is true when comparing the 2023 emission cut to the total cut since 1990. Norway's greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 9.1% from 1990 to 2023, and the 4.7% decrease from 2022 to 2023 accounts for a similar-sized cut as the entire period from 1990 to 2022. However, the claim is misleading when considering other reference points, such as the politicians' birth years or the peak emission year of 2007. Emissions have decreased by 9.8% since Hoem's birth year (1995) and 14.6% since Svenneby's birth year (1997), making the 2023 cut less significant in comparison. Additionally, emissions have decreased by 17.4% since the peak year of 2007, with less than a quarter of this reduction coming from 2023. The complexity of attributing emission cuts to specific governments also adds to the claim's misleading nature, as policies implemented by previous governments can have delayed effects.;Norwegian Youth Leader’s Claim of 2023 Emissions Cuts Matching Lifetime Reductions Is Partially True but Misleading;Assertion: Astrid Hoem, leader of AUF, claimed during a debate that the Labour Party/Socialist Party government cut greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 by as much as all previous governments combined during her and Ola Svenneby’s lifetimes, implying that the 2023 reduction (under the current government) matches or exceeds the total emissions cuts from 1990 to 2022. Conclusion: The claim is mixed—partially true but potentially misleading. According to Statistics Norway, Norway’s greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 4.7% (2.3 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalents) in 2023 compared to 2022, which is roughly equivalent to the total reduction from 1990 to 2022 (4.6%). This supports Hoem’s claim when using 1990 as the reference year. However, emissions fluctuated over the years, peaking in 2007, and the total reduction from 1995 (Hoem’s birth year) is 9.8%, and from 1997 (Svenneby’s birth year) is 14.6%, with only 23% of the reduction since 2007 occurring in 2023. This indicates that previous governments contributed significantly to emissions cuts, particularly from 2007 to 2021 under the Conservative government. Additionally, emissions trends are influenced by long-term policies and societal factors, not solely the current government’s actions, making it misleading to attribute the 2023 reduction entirely to the Labour Party/Socialist Party government.;1. Claim being verified: Astrid Hoem, leader of AUF, claimed that the Labour Party/Socialist Party government cut greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 by as much as all previous governments combined during her and Ola Svenneby’s lifetimes, suggesting the 2023 reduction matches or exceeds the total emissions cuts from 1990 to 2022. 2. Final verdict: Mixed—partially true but potentially misleading. 3. Evidence or reasoning supporting the verdict: - Supporting the claim: Statistics Norway’s preliminary figures show a 4.7% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 (2.3 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalents) compared to 2022, roughly equivalent to the total reduction from 1990 to 2022 (4.6%). This aligns with Hoem’s claim when using 1990 as the reference year. - Complicating the claim: Emissions peaked in 2007, and the total reduction from 1995 (Hoem’s birth year) is 9.8%, and from 1997 (Svenneby’s birth year) is 14.6%, with only 23% of the post-2007 reduction occurring in 2023. This shows significant cuts under previous governments, particularly from 2007 to 2021 under the Conservative government. - Misleading aspects: Emissions trends are influenced by long-term policies (e.g., electric car policies from the 1990s) and societal factors, not solely the current government’s actions. Attributing the 2023 reduction entirely to the Labour Party/Socialist Party government oversimplifies the complex factors driving emissions trends.
FC_06;Assertion;Correct, but also a bit misleading about emissions cuts;AssertionDuring the last year of last year, the Labor Party government has cut as much as all the last governments under Ola Svenneby and my lifetime.Astrid Hoem. Youth Party Leader Debate, Arendal Week 2024, 14.08.2024 ConclusionThis is true if we refer to emissions per year, and take 1990 as the starting point compared to 2022 and 2023. Preliminary figures show that greenhouse gas emissions in Norway in 2023 were 4.7 percent lower than the previous year, and 9.1 percent lower than in 1990. In 2022, emissions were 4.6 percent lower than in 1990.;"This is the fact-check:Climate was one of the big topics when the youth party leaders met for a debate at Arendal Week. Among others, AUF's Astrid Hoem and Ola Svenneby from Unge Høyre met for a duel.With increasingly short speaking time, claims were made about whose government had built the most offshore wind turbines and who had cut greenhouse gas emissions the most.Astrid Hoem stated that the Conservative governments have performed poorly on climate, and made the following claim:– During the last year of last year, the Labor Party government has cut as much as all the last governments under Ola Svenneby and my lifetime.Later, the AUF leader repeated the claim that the Labour Party/Socialist Party government has cut more: – Now the numbers are very clear. We have cut as much in one year last year as has been cut during our entire lifetime of government terms. Read more fact checks from the youth party leadership debate:Outdated emission targets from Simen VelleThis shows the emissions figuresWhat do the actual emissions figures show, and is it true that as much was cut in one year in 2023 as under all the last governments in the lifetime of the youth politicians?In any case, it is true that the figures show a clear decrease in Norwegian greenhouse gas emissions in 2023.Statistics Norway's preliminary figures for Norwegian greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 show that greenhouse gas emissions in Norway decreased by 4.7 percent compared to the previous year. In total, emissions ended at 46.6 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalents , which was 2.3 million tonnes lower than in 2022. According to Statistics Norway, emissions decreased, among other things, because there was less activity in industry and fewer emissions from the oil and gas industry – and because Norwegians drove more electric cars.A decrease of 4.7 percent from 2022 to 2023 is greater than the percentage decrease between other individual years from 1990 to the present.If we look at the actual size of the emission cuts per year, there was only one year that had larger cuts: In 2009, emissions decreased by 2.5 million tons.Statistics Norway's figures for 2023 are preliminary, and it is expected that they will change somewhat when final figures are presented in November.– We therefore cannot yet say for sure that 2023 is the year with the largest decline in the time series, emphasizes Trude Melby Bothner, senior advisor at Statistics Norway, to Faktisk.no.9.1 percent down from 19902023 could therefore be the single year with the largest reduction, even though we are still far from the climate goals. But Hoem's statement can be interpreted as meaning that the cut in 2023 was as large as all other emissions cuts from various governments combined.When Faktisk.no contacts AUF and asks about the basis for the claim, they refer to developments since 1990. 1990 is often used as a reference year, because the climate goals and the Paris Agreement are based on this year.Greenhouse gas emissions in 2022 were 4.6 percent lower than in 1990. By 2023, the emission reduction had increased to 9.1 percent. It is therefore true that the cut in 2023 was approximately the same size as the emission cut between 1990 and 2022. But this way of calculating skips all the years between 1990 and 2022. If we look more closely at these years, the picture is more complex.Borgar Aamaas, senior researcher at the Cicero Center for Climate Research, believes that Hoem's statement is both correct and misleading . – If the point is to make it clear that the current government has pursued climate policies that have led to large emissions cuts versus previous governments that have not achieved this, these statements are very misleading, the climate scientist tells Faktisk.no.Climate measures in road traffic and oil and gas extraction, and lower activity in industry, contributed to the decline from 2022 to 2023, according to Statistics Norway. Photo: Tor Erik Schrøder / NTBA challenge with greenhouse gas emissions in Norway is that they increased from the starting year 1990 and stabilized in the 2000s with 2007 as the peak year, before gradually declining with an increasingly steep curve, the researcher explains.– With 1990 as the main year, it can be said that emissions have not decreased significantly, and that the decrease in 2023 is about the same as in 1990-2022.This is not the case if you start from other years. Hoem was born in 1995, and Svenneby in 1997:	Emissions in 1995 were only slightly above the 1990 level, and in that sense Hoem's analysis holds up, with a total decrease of 9.8 percent from 1995 to 2023, explains Aamaas.	In 1997 , emissions were somewhat higher. This gives a decrease of 14.6 percent from 1997 to 2023. Last year's cut will then be a smaller part of the total cut.The peak in emissions was in 2007. Since then, emissions have been reduced by 17.4 percent. Less than a quarter (23%) of this emission reduction came last year.– Thus, one can also argue that the emission reduction while the bourgeois government was in power between 2013-2021 was far greater than what has happened under the current government, based on the same statistics that Hoem has used, says Aamas.– But the current government has not been in office for that long, so it is not surprising that the cut so far is not that large, he adds.Borgar Aamaas is a researcher with a meteorology background at the Center for Climate Research, CICERO. Photo: Baard SalvesenAamaas points out that emissions are influenced by many factors over a long period of time – local and international politics, business and general societal trends that together explain emissions trends.– Furthermore, it can take a long time from when a policy is adopted and implemented until it has an impact on emissions statistics.An example of this is the electric car policy, which we can trace back to the 1990s, but where the effect of the policy has only become truly visible in recent years, the researcher points out.– Who then has the credit for the emissions cuts that are happening now? Similarly, the conservative side can argue that policies they implemented while they were in government are now showing up in the numbers and providing an additional emissions cut, says Aamaas.– The short version is that this is complicated, and it is not the case that any sitting government is fully responsible for emissions trends while they are in power.To summarize, Hoem's claim is correct under certain assumptions, but it is also a bit misleading.It is true that the cuts were as much in 2023 as between 1990 and 2022, but the cuts were more overall during Svenneby's lifetime or during Erna Solberg's government. Nor can the government necessarily take credit for the emissions going down on their watch.Astrid Hoem writes in an email to Faktisk.no that 1990 is the starting point in all climate debate when talking about climate cuts.– That is the reference year we use. It is a fact that the same amount of cuts were made in 2023 as was done from 1990 until then, she writes.– So I tried to say this in a somewhat funny way. The most important thing for me is that greenhouse gas emissions are cut, and it is no secret that AUF wants to speed things up even more.";Chain-of-Thought;Claimed 2023 Emission Cuts Equal All Previous Reductions — Technically True, But Misleading;Assertion: AUF leader Astrid Hoem claimed that the Labour Party/Socialist Left Party government cut as much greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 as all previous Norwegian governments combined had done during her and Unge Høyre leader Ola Svenneby’s lifetimes — essentially equating the 2023 cut to the total emissions reduction since 1990. Conclusion: The claim is technically correct but misleading. It is true that the emissions reduction in 2023 (2.3 million tonnes, or 4.7%) was roughly equal to the total reduction from 1990 to 2022. However, this framing omits the broader trend: emissions were higher in the 1990s and peaked in 2007, then declined gradually. Greater cuts occurred during the period from 2007 to 2023, including under conservative-led governments. Moreover, attributing cuts solely to the current government is problematic, as emissions trends result from long-term policies, economic activity, and broader societal changes.;1. What is the claim being evaluated? AUF leader Astrid Hoem claimed that the Labour/Socialist Left government cut as much greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 as all previous Norwegian governments had done during her and Unge Høyre leader Ola Svenneby’s lifetimes — or, more specifically, that the 2023 cut was equal to the total reduction from 1990 up to 2022. --- 2. What is the verdict? Mixed – the claim is technically correct but misleading. --- 3. Justify the decision based on key supporting evidence:  True elements:  According to preliminary data from Statistics Norway, emissions dropped by 4.7% in 2023, equivalent to a 2.3 million tonne reduction.  Emissions were 4.6% lower in 2022 than in 1990, and with the 2023 reduction, the total cut reached 9.1% from 1990 — meaning 2023 alone accounted for about half of the total cut since 1990.  Therefore, the 2023 cut was indeed approximately equal in size to the cumulative cuts between 1990 and 2022.  Misleading elements:  The claim implies that the current government is solely responsible for this reduction, which is not supported by the data.  Emissions reductions are affected by long-term policies, industry trends, and societal changes — many of which were initiated under earlier governments (e.g., electric vehicle incentives).  When using birth years as reference points (1995 for Hoem, 1997 for Svenneby), total reductions since then are larger than the 2023 cut alone.  More emission cuts occurred under the Conservative-led government from 2013 to 2021 than during the current administration so far. In summary, while the emission drop in 2023 was unusually large and roughly matched total reductions from 1990–2022, using this to draw political comparisons is oversimplified and potentially misleading.;Hoem's Climate Claim: 2023 Cuts Match Decades of Progress, But Verdict is Mixed;Assertion: Astrid Hoem (AUF leader) claimed that the Labour Party/Socialist Party government, in 2023, cut as much greenhouse gas emissions as all previous governments combined during the lifetimes of herself and Ola Svenneby (Unge Høyre leader), or alternatively, as much as was cut between 1990 and 2022. Conclusion: Hoem's claim is partially correct but also misleading.  Partially Correct: It is true that the greenhouse gas emission reduction in 2023 (2.3 million tonnes, a 4.7% decrease) was approximately equal to the net reduction observed between 1990 and 2022 (from 1990 emissions were down 4.6% by 2022, and by 2023 they were down 9.1% from 1990). If 1990 is taken as the baseline and only the net change from that year is considered, the 2023 cut indeed represents a significant portion of the overall reduction. Also, if Hoem's birth year (1995) is used as a baseline, the analysis holds up more strongly.  Misleading:  The claim skips over the fluctuations and periods of increase in emissions between 1990 and 2022.  If other starting points are used (e.g., Svenneby's birth year 1997, or the peak emission year 2007), the 2023 cut represents a smaller proportion of the total reduction.  A significant portion of overall emission reductions happened under previous governments (e.g., 23% of the reduction since 2007 occurred in 2023, meaning 77% occurred before).  It's difficult to solely credit the current government for the 2023 cuts, as emissions are influenced by long-term policies and societal trends that span multiple administrations (e.g., electric car policy).;Here's the verdict of the fact-check: 1. What is the claim being evaluated? Astrid Hoem, leader of AUF, claimed that the Labour Party/Socialist Party government, in 2023, cut as much greenhouse gas emissions as all previous governments combined during the lifetimes of herself and Ola Svenneby, or equivalently, as much as was cut between 1990 and 2022. 2. What is the verdict (true/false/mixed)? Mixed (Partially correct but misleading). 3. Justify the decision based on key supporting evidence. The verdict is mixed because while the claim holds true under a specific interpretation and baseline, it becomes misleading when considering a broader context or different baselines. Supporting Evidence for Partially Correct:  2023 Reduction vs. 1990-2022 Net Reduction: Statistics Norway's preliminary figures show a 4.7% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions from 2022 to 2023, totaling 2.3 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalents. This 4.7% decrease roughly equates to the cumulative net decrease from 1990 to 2022 (where emissions were 4.6% lower than 1990). By 2023, the total reduction from 1990 had increased to 9.1%, meaning the 2023 cut effectively doubled the net reduction from the 1990-2022 period.  Hoem's Birth Year as Baseline: If Hoem's birth year (1995) is used as a baseline, the analysis supports her claim, with a total decrease of 9.8 percent from 1995 to 2023, of which 2023's cut is a significant part. Supporting Evidence for Misleading:  Ignoring Intervening Years: The calculation skips all the years between 1990 and 2022, where emissions fluctuated and even increased, peaking in 2007.  Different Baselines Yield Different Proportions: If Ola Svenneby's birth year (1997) is used as a baseline, emissions were higher, and the 2023 cut represents a smaller portion of the total 14.6% decrease from 1997 to 2023. More significantly, since the peak in 2007, emissions have been reduced by 17.4%, but less than a quarter (23%) of this reduction occurred in 2023. This implies that the majority of cuts since the peak happened under previous governments.  Complexity of Attributing Credit: Climate scientist Borgar Aamaas emphasizes that emissions are influenced by long-term factors, policies, and societal trends spanning multiple governments. Policies implemented by previous governments (e.g., electric car policy from the 1990s) are only now showing their full effect, making it difficult to solely attribute the 2023 cuts to the current government.;AUF Leader's Claim of Record Emission Cuts Partly True, But Misleading in Broader Context;Assertion: Astrid Hoem's core claim is that the Labor Party government cut greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 by as much as all previous governments combined during her lifetime and Ola Svenneby's lifetime. Conclusion: The verdict is that Hoem's claim is both correct and misleading. According to Statistics Norway, the 4.7% decrease in emissions from 2022 to 2023 is significant, and the total emission reduction from 1990 to 2023 is 9.1%, with 2023's cut being approximately the same size as the emission cut between 1990 and 2022. However, the claim's accuracy depends on the reference year used. If considering Hoem's lifetime (born in 1995), the analysis holds up with a total decrease of 9.8% from 1995 to 2023. In contrast, if looking at Svenneby's lifetime (born in 1997) or the period since the peak emissions in 2007, the picture becomes more complex, and the claim can be seen as misleading. Borgar Aamaas, a senior researcher at the Cicero Center for Climate Research, notes that emissions trends are influenced by various factors, making it challenging to attribute credit for emission cuts to specific governments ¹ ².;Claim being evaluated: Astrid Hoem's claim that the Labor Party government has cut greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 by as much as all previous governments combined during her lifetime and Ola Svenneby's lifetime. Verdict: Mixed (both true and misleading). Justification: The claim is true when considering the reference year 1990, as the climate goals and Paris Agreement are based on this year. According to Statistics Norway, greenhouse gas emissions in 2022 were 4.6% lower than in 1990, and by 2023, the emission reduction had increased to 9.1%. The cut in 2023 (2.3 million tonnes) is approximately the same size as the emission cut between 1990 and 2022. However, the claim is misleading when considering other reference points, such as the youth party leaders' lifetimes or the period since the peak emissions in 2007. If looking at Hoem's lifetime (born in 1995), emissions decreased by 9.8% from 1995 to 2023, which supports her claim. If looking at Svenneby's lifetime (born in 1997), emissions decreased by 14.6% from 1997 to 2023, making the 2023 cut a smaller part of the total cut. Since the peak emissions in 2007, emissions have been reduced by 17.4%, with less than a quarter (23%) of this reduction occurring in 2023. Additionally, Borgar Aamaas, a senior researcher at the Cicero Center for Climate Research, points out that emissions trends are influenced by various factors, making it challenging to attribute credit for emission cuts to specific governments. This complexity adds to the claim being considered misleading.;Claim of Labour Party's 2023 Emissions Cuts Matching All Prior Governments' Reductions in Leaders' Lifetimes Is Partially Correct but Misleading;Assertion: Astrid Hoem, leader of AUF, claimed during a debate that the Labour Party/Socialist Party government cut greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 by as much as all previous governments combined during her and Ola Svenneby’s lifetimes, implying superior climate performance under the current government compared to previous ones. Conclusion: The claim is partially correct but misleading. According to Statistics Norway, 2023 saw a 4.7% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (2.3 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalents), matching the total reduction from 1990 to 2022 (4.6%). However, this comparison oversimplifies the emissions trend, as emissions rose until 2007 and only began declining significantly afterward. From 1995 (Hoem’s birth year), emissions fell by 9.8%, and from 1997 (Svenneby’s birth year), by 14.6%, with only a fraction of these reductions occurring in 2023. Notably, the 2007–2023 period, including Conservative-led governments (2013–2021), saw a 17.4% reduction, with less than a quarter occurring in 2023. Emissions trends are influenced by long-term policies and societal factors, not solely the current government’s actions. Thus, while technically accurate using 1990 as a reference, the claim exaggerates the current government’s impact and ignores significant reductions under prior administrations.;1. Claim Being Evaluated: Astrid Hoem claimed that the Labour Party/Socialist Party government cut greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 by as much as all previous governments combined during her and Ola Svenneby’s lifetimes. 2. Verdict: Mixed (partially correct but misleading). 3. Justification: - Supporting Evidence: Statistics Norway’s preliminary figures show a 4.7% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 (2.3 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalents), roughly equal to the total reduction from 1990 to 2022 (4.6%). This supports Hoem’s claim when using 1990 as the reference year. - Counter Evidence: Emissions increased until 2007, with a 17.4% reduction from 2007 to 2023, of which only 23% occurred in 2023. From 1995 (Hoem’s birth year), emissions fell by 9.8%, and from 1997 (Svenneby’s birth year), by 14.6%, indicating significant reductions occurred before 2023, particularly under Conservative-led governments (2013–2021). - Reasoning: The claim is technically correct using 1990–2022 as a baseline but oversimplifies the complex emissions trend and exaggerates the current government’s role. Long-term policies, like electric car incentives from the 1990s, and broader societal factors also drive reductions, making it misleading to attribute 2023’s cuts solely to the current government.

The most important thing for me is that greenhouse gas emissions are cut, and it is no secret that AUF wants to speed things up even more.";Contextual;Hoem’s Claim That 2023 Emission Cuts Equal All Previous Reductions Is Partly True but Misleading;Assertion: Astrid Hoem (AUF) claimed that the Norwegian Labour Party government cut as much greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 as all previous governments combined during the lifetime of the youth politicians (since 1990). She emphasized that the emission reduction achieved in 2023 alone was equal to the total reduction made from 1990 up until 2022. --- Conclusion: The claim is partly true but misleading.  It is true that the emissions cut in 2023 (a 4.7% drop) was roughly equal to the cumulative emissions reductions made between 1990 and 2022 (a 4.6% drop relative to 1990 levels).  However, looking at emissions trends more broadly (since 1990 or since the youth leaders’ birth years), the total reductions over the entire period and during previous governments—such as the bourgeois government from 2013 to 2021—were larger.  Emissions peaked in 2007 and have declined since, meaning last year’s cut is only part of a longer trend, influenced by multiple factors and policies over time, some predating the current government.  Therefore, while the 2023 drop is significant, the statement oversimplifies complex emissions trends and the attribution of responsibility to the current government. --- Let me know if you want me to help with a more concise or detailed version!;Certainly! Here’s the verdict breakdown for the fact-check: --- 1. Claim being assessed: Astrid Hoem claimed that the Norwegian Labour Party government cut as much greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 as all previous governments combined during the lifetime of the youth politicians (since 1990). 2. Verdict: Mixed — the claim is partly true but also misleading. 3. Reasoning/Evidence:  Emissions in 2023 decreased by about 4.7%, which is roughly equal to the total emissions reduction achieved between 1990 and 2022 (4.6%). This supports the claim’s numerical basis when using 1990 as the reference year.  However, when emissions are viewed over the entire period since the youth politicians were born (mid-1990s) or since the emissions peak in 2007, the total reductions are larger, and last year’s cut represents only a fraction of that decline.  Past governments, especially the conservative one from 2013-2021, contributed significantly to emissions reductions that are not acknowledged in the claim.  Emissions trends are complex, influenced by many factors over long periods, making it difficult to attribute cuts solely to the current government’s actions.  Therefore, the claim oversimplifies the situation and can mislead about the scale and responsibility of the recent emissions cuts. --- If you want, I can also help frame this as a short summary or a formal fact-check statement!;Fact Check: AUF's Astrid Hoem's Claim on Climate Cuts in 2023 - Mixed Verdict;Assertion: Astrid Hoem, leader of AUF (Labor Party's youth wing), claimed that the current Labor Party government cut as much in greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 as all previous governments combined during her and Ola Svenneby's lifetime. She later reiterated that the cuts in 2023 were as much as during all government terms in their entire lifetime. Conclusion: The claim is mixed.  Reasoning for True (under specific conditions): It is true that the greenhouse gas emission cut in 2023 (4.7% decrease, 2.3 million tonnes) was approximately the same size as the cumulative emission cut between 1990 and 2022. Since 1990 is a commonly used reference year for climate goals and Hoem was born in 1995, her statement holds true if all the last governments is interpreted as the net reduction from the 1990 baseline until 2022.  Reasoning for Misleading (under other conditions): The claim is misleading because:  It skips the years between 1990 and 2022 where emissions fluctuated and even increased for a period.  If other starting points are used (e.g., Svenneby's birth year of 1997, or the peak emission year of 2007), the 2023 cut represents a smaller portion of the total reduction.  The overall emission reduction during the bourgeois government (2013-2021) was significantly greater than what has happened under the current government so far.  Attributing emission cuts solely to the sitting government is complex, as policies implemented by previous governments (like electric car incentives) often have delayed effects on emissions. Many factors, including economic activity, influence emission trends.;Here's the verdict for the fact-check: 1. What is the claim being assessed? Astrid Hoem, leader of AUF, claimed that the Labor Party government in 2023 cut as much in greenhouse gas emissions as all previous governments combined during her and Ola Svenneby's lifetime, or as much as during all government terms in their entire lifetime. 2. What is the verdict (true/false/mixed)? Mixed. 3. What reasoning or evidence supports the conclusion?  Supporting True (under specific interpretation): Statistics Norway's preliminary figures show a 4.7% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions in Norway from 2022 to 2023, totaling 2.3 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalents. This reduction is approximately the same size as the net emission cut between the reference year 1990 and 2022 (from 4.6% below 1990 in 2022 to 9.1% below 1990 in 2023). Given that 1990 is a common climate debate reference and Hoem was born in 1995 (close to the 1990 baseline), her statement can be considered accurate under this specific interpretation.  Supporting Misleading (under broader interpretation):  The calculation using the 1990-2022 period as a single cut ignores the years in between where emissions fluctuated and even increased.  If emissions are tracked from the peak year in 2007, the 2023 cut accounts for less than a quarter (23%) of the total 17.4% reduction since then.  The emission reduction during the bourgeois government (2013-2021) was significantly larger than what has occurred under the current government so far.  Emissions are influenced by long-term factors and policies (like the electric car policy initiated in the 1990s) that take time to show effects, making it complex to attribute credit solely to the sitting government.;AUF Leader's Claim of Record Emission Cuts: Mixed Verdict;Assertion: Astrid Hoem claims that the Labor Party government has cut greenhouse gas emissions by as much in one year (2023) as all previous governments combined since 1990, or in her lifetime and that of Ola Svenneby. Conclusion: The verdict is mixed. According to Statistics Norway, the 4.7% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 is greater than most annual decreases since 1990, and the actual size of the emission cuts in 2023 is roughly equivalent to the total reduction between 1990 and 2022. However, when considering different time frames, such as since 2007 (the peak emission year) or the lifetimes of Hoem and Svenneby, the claim becomes misleading. Emissions have decreased by 9.8% since Hoem's birth year (1995) and 14.6% since Svenneby's birth year (1997). Moreover, attributing the emission cuts solely to the current government is complicated due to factors like policy implementation delays and the impact of previous governments' policies ¹ ².;Claim being assessed: Astrid Hoem's claim that the Labor Party government has cut greenhouse gas emissions by as much in one year (2023) as all previous governments combined in her lifetime and Ola Svenneby's lifetime, or alternatively, as much as all previous governments since 1990. Verdict: Mixed Reasoning or evidence: The claim is true when comparing the 2023 emission cut to the total reduction between 1990 and 2022, with a 9.1% decrease in emissions from 1990 levels and a 4.7% decrease in 2023 being roughly equivalent in size. However, the claim is misleading when considering different time frames, such as: Since 2007 (peak emission year), emissions have decreased by 17.4%, with less than a quarter of this reduction occurring in 2023. Since Hoem's birth year (1995), emissions have decreased by 9.8% by 2023, which aligns with her claim. Since Svenneby's birth year (1997), emissions have decreased by 14.6% by 2023, making the 2023 cut a smaller part of the total reduction. Additionally, attributing the emission cuts solely to the current government is complicated due to factors like policy implementation delays and the impact of previous governments' policies. ;AUF Leader Claims 2023 Emissions Cut Matches All Prior Governments’ Reductions Since 1990: Mixed Verdict, Misleading Due to Complex Trends;Assertion: Astrid Hoem, leader of AUF, claimed during a debate that the Labour Party/Socialist Party government cut greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 by as much as all previous governments combined during her and Ola Svenneby’s lifetimes, specifically referencing the period from 1990 to 2022. Conclusion: The claim is partially true but misleading. It is factually correct that Norway’s greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 4.7% (2.3 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalents) in 2023, roughly equivalent to the total reduction from 1990 to 2022 (4.6% by 2022, increasing to 9.1% by 2023). However, this comparison oversimplifies the emissions trend, as emissions rose until 2007 before declining. From 1995 (Hoem’s birth year), emissions fell by 9.8%, and from 1997 (Svenneby’s birth year), by 14.6%, with only part of these reductions occurring in 2023. Additionally, the 2009 reduction (2.5 million tonnes) was larger than 2023’s. The claim is misleading because it implies the current government’s policies alone drove the 2023 reduction, whereas emissions trends are influenced by long-term factors, including policies from prior governments (e.g., electric car incentives from the 1990s) and external factors like reduced industrial activity. Thus, attributing the 2023 cut solely to the current government is inaccurate, and the total reduction since 2007 (17.4%) shows significant cuts under previous governments, particularly from 2013–2021.;1. Claim Being Assessed: Astrid Hoem, leader of AUF, claimed that the Labour Party/Socialist Party government cut greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 by as much as all previous governments combined during her and Ola Svenneby’s lifetimes, specifically referencing the period from 1990 to 2022. 2. Verdict: Mixed (partially true but misleading). 3. Reasoning and Evidence: - Evidence Supporting the Claim: According to Statistics Norway’s preliminary figures, Norway’s greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 4.7% (2.3 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalents) from 2022 to 2023, totaling 46.6 million tonnes. This reduction is roughly equivalent to the total emission reduction from 1990 to 2022 (4.6% by 2022, increasing to 9.1% by 2023 when including the 2023 cut). Thus, Hoem’s claim is factually correct when comparing the 2023 reduction to the net reduction from 1990 to 2022. - Why It’s Misleading: The claim oversimplifies the emissions trend. Emissions increased from 1990, peaking in 2007, before declining. From 1995 (Hoem’s birth year), emissions fell by 9.8%, and from 1997 (Svenneby’s birth year), by 14.6%, with the 2023 cut being only a portion of these totals. Notably, 2009 saw a larger reduction (2.5 million tonnes). The claim implies the current government’s policies were solely responsible for the 2023 reduction, but emissions are influenced by long-term factors, including policies from prior governments (e.g., electric car incentives from the 1990s) and external factors like reduced industrial activity and oil/gas emissions. From 2007 to 2023, emissions fell by 17.4%, with less than a quarter of this reduction occurring in 2023, indicating significant cuts under previous governments (e.g., 2013–2021). Attributing the 2023 reduction entirely to the current government is misleading, as emissions trends result from complex, multi-decade factors.
FC_06;Assertion;Correct, but also a bit misleading about emissions cuts;AssertionDuring the last year of last year, the Labor Party government has cut as much as all the last governments under Ola Svenneby and my lifetime.Astrid Hoem. Youth Party Leader Debate, Arendal Week 2024, 14.08.2024 ConclusionThis is true if we refer to emissions per year, and take 1990 as the starting point compared to 2022 and 2023. Preliminary figures show that greenhouse gas emissions in Norway in 2023 were 4.7 percent lower than the previous year, and 9.1 percent lower than in 1990. In 2022, emissions were 4.6 percent lower than in 1990.;"This is the fact-check:Climate was one of the big topics when the youth party leaders met for a debate at Arendal Week. Among others, AUF's Astrid Hoem and Ola Svenneby from Unge Høyre met for a duel.With increasingly short speaking time, claims were made about whose government had built the most offshore wind turbines and who had cut greenhouse gas emissions the most.Astrid Hoem stated that the Conservative governments have performed poorly on climate, and made the following claim:– During the last year of last year, the Labor Party government has cut as much as all the last governments under Ola Svenneby and my lifetime.Later, the AUF leader repeated the claim that the Labour Party/Socialist Party government has cut more: – Now the numbers are very clear. We have cut as much in one year last year as has been cut during our entire lifetime of government terms. Read more fact checks from the youth party leadership debate:Outdated emission targets from Simen VelleThis shows the emissions figuresWhat do the actual emissions figures show, and is it true that as much was cut in one year in 2023 as under all the last governments in the lifetime of the youth politicians?In any case, it is true that the figures show a clear decrease in Norwegian greenhouse gas emissions in 2023.Statistics Norway's preliminary figures for Norwegian greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 show that greenhouse gas emissions in Norway decreased by 4.7 percent compared to the previous year. In total, emissions ended at 46.6 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalents , which was 2.3 million tonnes lower than in 2022. According to Statistics Norway, emissions decreased, among other things, because there was less activity in industry and fewer emissions from the oil and gas industry – and because Norwegians drove more electric cars.A decrease of 4.7 percent from 2022 to 2023 is greater than the percentage decrease between other individual years from 1990 to the present.If we look at the actual size of the emission cuts per year, there was only one year that had larger cuts: In 2009, emissions decreased by 2.5 million tons.Statistics Norway's figures for 2023 are preliminary, and it is expected that they will change somewhat when final figures are presented in November.– We therefore cannot yet say for sure that 2023 is the year with the largest decline in the time series, emphasizes Trude Melby Bothner, senior advisor at Statistics Norway, to Faktisk.no.9.1 percent down from 19902023 could therefore be the single year with the largest reduction, even though we are still far from the climate goals. But Hoem's statement can be interpreted as meaning that the cut in 2023 was as large as all other emissions cuts from various governments combined.When Faktisk.no contacts AUF and asks about the basis for the claim, they refer to developments since 1990. 1990 is often used as a reference year, because the climate goals and the Paris Agreement are based on this year.Greenhouse gas emissions in 2022 were 4.6 percent lower than in 1990. By 2023, the emission reduction had increased to 9.1 percent. It is therefore true that the cut in 2023 was approximately the same size as the emission cut between 1990 and 2022. But this way of calculating skips all the years between 1990 and 2022. If we look more closely at these years, the picture is more complex.Borgar Aamaas, senior researcher at the Cicero Center for Climate Research, believes that Hoem's statement is both correct and misleading . – If the point is to make it clear that the current government has pursued climate policies that have led to large emissions cuts versus previous governments that have not achieved this, these statements are very misleading, the climate scientist tells Faktisk.no.Climate measures in road traffic and oil and gas extraction, and lower activity in industry, contributed to the decline from 2022 to 2023, according to Statistics Norway. Photo: Tor Erik Schrøder / NTBA challenge with greenhouse gas emissions in Norway is that they increased from the starting year 1990 and stabilized in the 2000s with 2007 as the peak year, before gradually declining with an increasingly steep curve, the researcher explains.– With 1990 as the main year, it can be said that emissions have not decreased significantly, and that the decrease in 2023 is about the same as in 1990-2022.This is not the case if you start from other years. Hoem was born in 1995, and Svenneby in 1997:	Emissions in 1995 were only slightly above the 1990 level, and in that sense Hoem's analysis holds up, with a total decrease of 9.8 percent from 1995 to 2023, explains Aamaas.	In 1997 , emissions were somewhat higher. This gives a decrease of 14.6 percent from 1997 to 2023. Last year's cut will then be a smaller part of the total cut.The peak in emissions was in 2007. Since then, emissions have been reduced by 17.4 percent. Less than a quarter (23%) of this emission reduction came last year.– Thus, one can also argue that the emission reduction while the bourgeois government was in power between 2013-2021 was far greater than what has happened under the current government, based on the same statistics that Hoem has used, says Aamas.– But the current government has not been in office for that long, so it is not surprising that the cut so far is not that large, he adds.Borgar Aamaas is a researcher with a meteorology background at the Center for Climate Research, CICERO. Photo: Baard SalvesenAamaas points out that emissions are influenced by many factors over a long period of time – local and international politics, business and general societal trends that together explain emissions trends.– Furthermore, it can take a long time from when a policy is adopted and implemented until it has an impact on emissions statistics.An example of this is the electric car policy, which we can trace back to the 1990s, but where the effect of the policy has only become truly visible in recent years, the researcher points out.– Who then has the credit for the emissions cuts that are happening now? Similarly, the conservative side can argue that policies they implemented while they were in government are now showing up in the numbers and providing an additional emissions cut, says Aamaas.– The short version is that this is complicated, and it is not the case that any sitting government is fully responsible for emissions trends while they are in power.To summarize, Hoem's claim is correct under certain assumptions, but it is also a bit misleading.It is true that the cuts were as much in 2023 as between 1990 and 2022, but the cuts were more overall during Svenneby's lifetime or during Erna Solberg's government. Nor can the government necessarily take credit for the emissions going down on their watch.Astrid Hoem writes in an email to Faktisk.no that 1990 is the starting point in all climate debate when talking about climate cuts.– That is the reference year we use. It is a fact that the same amount of cuts were made in 2023 as was done from 1990 until then, she writes.– So I tried to say this in a somewhat funny way. The most important thing for me is that greenhouse gas emissions are cut, and it is no secret that AUF wants to speed things up even more.";Least-to-most ;Labour Party’s 2023 Emissions Cut Matches 1990–2022 Total — But Claim Overstates Government’s Sole Credit;Assertion: Astrid Hoem claimed that the Norwegian Labour Party government cut as much greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 as all previous governments combined during the lifetime of the youth politicians, implying the 2023 cut was exceptionally large and unmatched. Conclusion: The claim is partly true but also misleading. The 2023 emissions reduction (4.7%) was roughly equal to the total cut from 1990 to 2022, which is often used as a baseline year in climate debates. However, when considering the entire lifetime of the youth politicians or since the peak emissions year (2007), the total reductions were actually larger under previous governments, especially the Conservative governments from 2013-2021. Emissions trends are complex, influenced by many factors over time, and no single government can take full credit for changes occurring during their term. Thus, while the 2023 cut was significant, Hoem’s framing oversimplifies the broader emissions history.;Certainly! Here’s the verdict breakdown for the fact-check: 1. What is the claim? Astrid Hoem claimed that the Labour Party government cut as much greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 as all previous governments combined during the youth politicians’ lifetime. 2. What is the final verdict? The claim is partly correct but misleading. While the 2023 emissions reduction was large—about equal to the total cuts made from 1990 to 2022—it does not surpass the total reductions achieved during the youth politicians’ lifetime or previous government terms. Emissions cuts have also been significant under past governments, especially between 2007 and 2021. 3. What evidence supports this verdict?  Statistics Norway shows a 4.7% emissions decrease in 2023, roughly matching the cumulative reduction from 1990 to 2022.  Emissions peaked in 2007 and have since decreased by 17.4%, with previous governments contributing significantly.  When using the youth politicians’ birth years (1995 and 1997) as starting points, total reductions exceed the 2023 single-year cut.  Climate experts emphasize emissions are influenced by long-term policies and factors, making it difficult to credit any one government fully for recent changes.;Youth Climate Debate: AUF's Record Cut Claim in 2023 is Partially True, But Misleading on Overall Progress;Assertion: Astrid Hoem, leader of AUF, claimed that the Labour Party government cut as much in greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 as all previous governments combined during her and Ola Svenneby's lifetimes. She later rephrased it to state that as much was cut in one year (2023) as was cut during our entire lifetime of government terms, and that the same amount of cuts were made in 2023 as was done from 1990 until then. Conclusion: Hoem's claim is partially correct but misleading. The evidence shows:  A significant decrease in 2023: Statistics Norway's preliminary figures indicate a 4.7% decrease in Norwegian greenhouse gas emissions in 2023, which is 2.3 million tonnes lower than in 2022. This is the largest percentage decrease between individual years from 1990 to the present, and the second largest actual tonnage cut (after 2009).  Correct from the 1990 baseline: It is true that the emission cut in 2023 was approximately the same size as the cumulative emission cut between 1990 and 2022 (where emissions decreased by 4.6% by 2022 and by 9.1% by 2023 from the 1990 baseline). Hoem's statement holds true if 1990 is used as the starting point.  Misleading when considering other baselines/total cuts:  Emissions increased significantly from 1990 to a peak in 2007 before declining.  If starting from Hoem's birth year (1995), the total decrease to 2023 is 9.8%, making the 2023 cut a substantial part.  If starting from Svenneby's birth year (1997), the total decrease is 14.6%, making the 2023 cut a smaller proportion of the total.  Since the 2007 peak, emissions have been reduced by 17.4%, and only 23% of this reduction occurred in 2023.  The bourgeois government (2013-2021) presided over a larger overall emission reduction during its tenure.  Attribution is complex: Emission trends are influenced by many long-term factors, including past policies (like electric car incentives from the 1990s) and general societal and economic trends, not solely by the current government's actions. It takes time for policies to impact statistics.;Here's the verdict for the fact-check: 1. What is the claim? Astrid Hoem, leader of AUF, claimed during a debate at Arendal Week that the current Labour Party government had cut as much in greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 as all previous governments combined during her and Ola Svenneby's lifetimes. She reiterated that the same amount of cuts were made in 2023 as was done from 1990 until then. 2. What is the final verdict? The claim is partially correct but misleading. 3. What evidence supports this verdict?  Evidence of correctness (under specific conditions):  Statistics Norway's preliminary figures for 2023 show a 4.7% decrease in Norwegian greenhouse gas emissions, amounting to 2.3 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalents, which is a significant single-year reduction and the largest percentage decrease since 1990.  When using 1990 as the reference year (which is a common baseline for climate goals and the Paris Agreement, as stated by Hoem), the total emission reduction from 1990 to 2022 was 4.6%, and by 2023 it increased to 9.1%. This means the cut in 2023 (4.5% of 1990 emissions) was approximately equal to the total cut accumulated between 1990 and 2022 (4.6% of 1990 emissions).  Evidence of misleading nature:  Excluding intervening years: This calculation method (from 1990 until then) ignores that emissions generally increased from 1990 to a peak in 2007 before gradually declining. Therefore, simply comparing 1990 to 2022 and then adding the 2023 cut doesn't reflect the full picture of emission trends under various governments.  Different baselines yield different conclusions:  From the peak in 2007, emissions have been reduced by 17.4%, and less than a quarter (23%) of this reduction occurred in 2023.  If considering Ola Svenneby's lifetime (born 1997, when emissions were somewhat higher than 1990), the total decrease to 2023 is 14.6%, making the 2023 cut a smaller part of the total.  Borgar Aamaas, a senior researcher at Cicero Center for Climate Research, points out that the emission reduction during the bourgeois government (2013-2021) was far greater than what has happened under the current government, based on the same statistics, as the current government has been in office for a shorter period.  Attribution complexity: Emissions are influenced by many factors over a long period, including local and international politics, economic activity, and general societal trends. Policies enacted by previous governments (e.g., electric car incentives from the 1990s) can have delayed effects that manifest in current emission figures. Therefore, it is difficult to attribute full credit for a single year's reduction solely to the sitting government.;AUF Leader's Claim of Record Emission Cuts: Partly True, But Misleading in Context;Assertion: Astrid Hoem, the leader of the Workers' Youth League (AUF), claimed that the Labor Party government cut greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 by as much as all previous governments combined during her lifetime and that of Ola Svenneby, the leader of Unge Høyre. Conclusion: The verdict is that Hoem's claim is both correct and misleading. According to Statistics Norway, greenhouse gas emissions in Norway decreased by 4.7% in 2023, which is approximately the same size as the emission cut between 1990 and 2022, totaling 9.1% reduction from 1990 levels. However, if considering other reference years, such as the peak emission year of 2007 or the politicians' birth years (1995 for Hoem and 1997 for Svenneby), the picture becomes more complex. The claim overlooks the fact that previous governments, including the Conservative government between 2013-2021, also made significant emission reductions. Additionally, researcher Borgar Aamaas points out that attributing emission reductions to specific governments is challenging due to the long-term impact of climate policies and various influencing factors ¹.;The Claim: Astrid Hoem claimed that the Labor Party government cut greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 by as much as all previous governments combined during her lifetime and Ola Svenneby's lifetime. The Final Verdict: The claim is both correct and misleading. Evidence Supporting the Verdict: Statistics Norway's preliminary figures show a 4.7% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 compared to 2022, which is approximately the same size as the emission cut between 1990 and 2022 (9.1% reduction from 1990 levels). Emissions trends vary depending on the reference year used, such as 1990, 1995 (Hoem's birth year), 1997 (Svenneby's birth year), or 2007 (peak emission year). Researcher Borgar Aamaas' analysis shows that previous governments, including the Conservative government between 2013-2021, also made significant emission reductions, and attributing emission reductions to specific governments is challenging due to the long-term impact of climate policies and various influencing factors.;AUF Leader’s Claim of 2023 Emissions Cuts Matching Lifetime Totals Is True but Misleading;Assertion: Astrid Hoem, leader of AUF, claimed during a debate that the Labour Party/Socialist Party government cut greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 by as much as all previous governments combined during her and Ola Svenneby’s lifetimes, using 1990 as the reference year. Conclusion: The claim is technically correct but misleading. Evidence from Statistics Norway shows a 4.7% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 (2.3 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalents), roughly equal to the total reduction from 1990 to 2022 (4.6%). However, emissions fluctuated, peaking in 2007, with a 17.4% reduction from 2007 to 2023, meaning the 2023 cut was only 23% of the total reduction since 2007. Additionally, emissions cuts are influenced by long-term factors like electric car policies and industry trends, not solely the current government’s actions. Thus, attributing the 2023 reduction entirely to the current government oversimplifies the issue.;1. Claim: Astrid Hoem, leader of AUF, claimed that the Labour Party/Socialist Party government cut greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 by as much as all previous governments combined during her and Ola Svenneby’s lifetimes, using 1990 as the reference year for climate goals. 2. Final Verdict: The claim is technically correct but misleading. 3. Evidence Supporting the Verdict: - Statistics Norway Data: Preliminary figures show a 4.7% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 (2.3 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalents), which is approximately equal to the total emission reduction from 1990 to 2022 (4.6%). - Historical Context: Emissions increased from 1990, peaked in 2007, and then declined by 17.4% from 2007 to 2023. The 2023 reduction represents only 23% of the total reduction since 2007, indicating significant cuts occurred under previous governments. - Complexity of Attribution: Emissions reductions are driven by long-term factors, such as electric car policies from the 1990s and reduced industrial activity, not solely the current government’s policies. This makes it misleading to credit the 2023 cut entirely to the current government. - Reference Year Analysis: Using 1990 as the reference supports Hoem’s claim, as the 2023 cut matches the 1990-2022 reduction. However, starting from other years (e.g., 1997 or 2007) shows larger cumulative reductions, weakening the claim’s emphasis on 2023 alone.

According to Statistics Norway, emissions decreased, among other things, because there was less activity in industry and fewer emissions from the oil and gas industry – and because Norwegians drove more electric cars.A decrease of 4.7 percent from 2022 to 2023 is greater than the percentage decrease between other individual years from 1990 to the present.If we look at the actual size of the emission cuts per year, there was only one year that had larger cuts: In 2009, emissions decreased by 2.5 million tons.Statistics Norway's figures for 2023 are preliminary, and it is expected that they will change somewhat when final figures are presented in November.– We therefore cannot yet say for sure that 2023 is the year with the largest decline in the time series, emphasizes Trude Melby Bothner, senior advisor at Statistics Norway, to Faktisk.no.9.1 percent down from 19902023 could therefore be the single year with the largest reduction, even though we are still far from the climate goals. But Hoem's statement can be interpreted as meaning that the cut in 2023 was as large as all other emissions cuts from various governments combined.When Faktisk.no contacts AUF and asks about the basis for the claim, they refer to developments since 1990. 1990 is often used as a reference year, because the climate goals and the Paris Agreement are based on this year.Greenhouse gas emissions in 2022 were 4.6 percent lower than in 1990. By 2023, the emission reduction had increased to 9.1 percent. It is therefore true that the cut in 2023 was approximately the same size as the emission cut between 1990 and 2022. But this way of calculating skips all the years between 1990 and 2022. If we look more closely at these years, the picture is more complex.Borgar Aamaas, senior researcher at the Cicero Center for Climate Research, believes that Hoem's statement is both correct and misleading . – If the point is to make it clear that the current government has pursued climate policies that have led to large emissions cuts versus previous governments that have not achieved this, these statements are very misleading, the climate scientist tells Faktisk.no.Climate measures in road traffic and oil and gas extraction, and lower activity in industry, contributed to the decline from 2022 to 2023, according to Statistics Norway. Photo: Tor Erik Schrøder / NTBA challenge with greenhouse gas emissions in Norway is that they increased from the starting year 1990 and stabilized in the 2000s with 2007 as the peak year, before gradually declining with an increasingly steep curve, the researcher explains.– With 1990 as the main year, it can be said that emissions have not decreased significantly, and that the decrease in 2023 is about the same as in 1990-2022.This is not the case if you start from other years. Hoem was born in 1995, and Svenneby in 1997:	Emissions in 1995 were only slightly above the 1990 level, and in that sense Hoem's analysis holds up, with a total decrease of 9.8 percent from 1995 to 2023, explains Aamaas.	In 1997 , emissions were somewhat higher. This gives a decrease of 14.6 percent from 1997 to 2023. Last year's cut will then be a smaller part of the total cut.The peak in emissions was in 2007. Since then, emissions have been reduced by 17.4 percent. Less than a quarter (23%) of this emission reduction came last year.– Thus, one can also argue that the emission reduction while the bourgeois government was in power between 2013-2021 was far greater than what has happened under the current government, based on the same statistics that Hoem has used, says Aamas.– But the current government has not been in office for that long, so it is not surprising that the cut so far is not that large, he adds.Borgar Aamaas is a researcher with a meteorology background at the Center for Climate Research, CICERO. Photo: Baard SalvesenAamaas points out that emissions are influenced by many factors over a long period of time – local and international politics, business and general societal trends that together explain emissions trends.– Furthermore, it can take a long time from when a policy is adopted and implemented until it has an impact on emissions statistics.An example of this is the electric car policy, which we can trace back to the 1990s, but where the effect of the policy has only become truly visible in recent years, the researcher points out.– Who then has the credit for the emissions cuts that are happening now? Similarly, the conservative side can argue that policies they implemented while they were in government are now showing up in the numbers and providing an additional emissions cut, says Aamaas.– The short version is that this is complicated, and it is not the case that any sitting government is fully responsible for emissions trends while they are in power.To summarize, Hoem's claim is correct under certain assumptions, but it is also a bit misleading.It is true that the cuts were as much in 2023 as between 1990 and 2022, but the cuts were more overall during Svenneby's lifetime or during Erna Solberg's government. Nor can the government necessarily take credit for the emissions going down on their watch.Astrid Hoem writes in an email to Faktisk.no that 1990 is the starting point in all climate debate when talking about climate cuts.– That is the reference year we use. It is a fact that the same amount of cuts were made in 2023 as was done from 1990 until then, she writes.– So I tried to say this in a somewhat funny way. The most important thing for me is that greenhouse gas emissions are cut, and it is no secret that AUF wants to speed things up even more.";Role;Norway’s 2023 Emission Cuts Significant but Not Larger Than All Previous Governments Combined — Claim Partially True but Misleading;Assertion: Astrid Hoem of AUF claimed that the Norwegian Labour Party/Socialist Party government cut as much greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 alone as all previous governments combined during the lifetime of the youth politicians (born mid-1990s), implying that last year’s emissions reduction was unprecedented and larger than all prior reductions under earlier governments. --- Conclusion: Mixed. The claim is partially true but also misleading depending on how the data is framed:  It is accurate that the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from 2022 to 2023 (a 4.7% decrease) was roughly equivalent to the total reduction from 1990 to 2022 (about 4.6%), when using 1990 as the baseline year—the standard reference point in climate policy.  However, this framing ignores emission trends within the period and alternative baselines. When considering the actual lifetime of the youth politicians (born mid-1990s), emissions have decreased more overall than just in 2023, especially when including reductions during previous conservative governments (e.g., between 2013-2021).  Emission reductions result from long-term policies and various external factors, making it difficult to credit any single government fully for the observed changes.  Therefore, while the 2023 cut was large and significant, it was neither uniquely unprecedented nor solely attributable to the current government. --- Let me know if you want it shorter or in a more conversational style!;Certainly! Here’s a clear, professional fact-check verdict: --- 1. What is the claim? Astrid Hoem claimed that in 2023, the Norwegian Labour Party/Socialist Party government cut as much greenhouse gas emissions in one year as all previous governments combined during the lifetime of the youth politicians (born mid-1990s). --- 2. What is the verdict? Mixed — The claim is partially true under specific assumptions but is also misleading. --- 3. What evidence supports this decision?  Statistics Norway reports a 4.7% reduction in emissions from 2022 to 2023, which is roughly equivalent to the total emissions reduction from 1990 to 2022, using 1990 as the baseline (the standard reference year in climate discussions).  When examining the period from the youth politicians’ birth years (1995 or 1997) to 2023, overall emission reductions are larger and not solely due to 2023’s cut.  Emission reductions during previous governments, including conservative ones, were significant, especially since emissions peaked in 2007 and declined notably before 2023.  Emissions trends result from multiple factors over long periods, making it inaccurate to credit any single government fully for the changes observed in a single year. --- If you want, I can also help formulate this for public communication or policy briefs!;Fact Check: Labour Government's 2023 Emission Cut Claim Is Mixed – Big Drop Matches Decades of Progress, But Context Matters;Assertion: Astrid Hoem, leader of AUF (Labour Party's youth wing), claimed that the Labour Party government cut as much in greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 as all previous governments combined during her and Ola Svenneby's lifetime. She later reiterated that the Labour Party/Socialist Party government cut as much in one year (2023) as had been cut during our entire lifetime of government terms. Conclusion: Mixed. While the claim is technically true under a specific interpretation, it is also misleading.  True (under specific interpretation): Statistics Norway's preliminary figures show that Norwegian greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 4.7 percent in 2023 (2.3 million tonnes). When comparing this cut to the total reduction from the 1990 reference year to 2022, it is true that the cut in 2023 was approximately the same size (from 4.6% reduction in 2022 to 9.1% reduction in 2023 from 1990 levels). Astrid Hoem explicitly stated that 1990 is the reference year used in all climate debate.  Misleading:  Ignoring intermediate years: This calculation method skips over the years between 1990 and 2022, during which emissions first increased, then stabilized, and eventually began to decline.  Larger cuts in other periods: If other reference points are used (e.g., the peak in 2007 or Ola Svenneby's birth year of 1997), the 2023 cut represents a smaller proportion of the total reduction. For instance, less than a quarter (23%) of the emission reduction since the 2007 peak occurred in 2023.  Larger cuts under previous governments: The bourgeois government (2013-2021) oversaw a far greater overall emission reduction based on the same statistics Hoem used, albeit over a longer period.  Credit for cuts: Emissions are influenced by long-term factors and policies that can take years to show effects. Therefore, the current government cannot solely claim credit for the 2023 reductions, as policies implemented by previous governments (like electric car incentives) are now manifesting. While 2023 did see a significant reduction, it was not the single largest tonnage cut (2009 had a larger decrease of 2.5 million tons).;1. What is the claim? Astrid Hoem, leader of AUF, claimed that the Labour Party government cut as much in greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 as all previous governments combined during her and Ola Svenneby's lifetime. She later refined this to state that the Labour Party/Socialist Party government cut as much in one year (2023) as had been cut during our entire lifetime of government terms. 2. What is the verdict? Mixed. The claim is technically true under a specific, but somewhat misleading, interpretation of emission data. 3. What evidence supports this decision?  Evidence supporting true (under specific interpretation):  Statistics Norway's preliminary figures indicate a 4.7% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions from 2022 to 2023, equating to 2.3 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalents. This is a significant single-year reduction.  When using 1990 as the baseline (a common reference year for climate goals and the Paris Agreement), Norway's greenhouse gas emissions were 4.6% lower in 2022 than in 1990. By 2023, this reduction increased to 9.1%. This means the change in reduction from the 1990 baseline in 2023 (4.5 percentage points) is approximately the same as the total reduction from 1990 to 2022 (4.6 percentage points). Astrid Hoem explicitly stated that 1990 is the reference year she used for all climate debate.  Evidence supporting misleading:  Skipping intermediate years: The 1990-2022 comparison ignores the actual emission trends during that period. Emissions in Norway generally increased from 1990, peaked around 2007, and then began a gradual decline.  Larger cuts in other periods (absolute terms): While 2023 saw a large percentage decrease, the largest tonnage cut in a single year was in 2009, with a 2.5 million tonne decrease, which is slightly more than 2023's 2.3 million tonnes.  Larger cuts under previous governments (different baselines): If the peak year of 2007 is used as a baseline, emissions have been reduced by 17.4% since then. The 2023 cut accounts for less than a quarter (23%) of this total reduction. Furthermore, the bourgeois government (2013-2021) oversaw a far greater overall emission reduction during its time in power than the current government has achieved so far.  Causality and long-term policies: Climate scientists, such as Borgar Aamaas from Cicero, emphasize that emission trends are influenced by many factors over long periods, including local and international politics, business cycles, and general societal trends. Policies enacted by previous governments, such as electric car incentives, can take years to show a significant impact on emission statistics. Therefore, attributing the entire 2023 cut solely to the current government's direct policies is an oversimplification.;Hoem's Claim on Record Climate Cuts: Mostly True but Misleading;Assertion: Astrid Hoem claims that the Labor Party government has cut greenhouse gas emissions by as much in one year (2023) as all previous governments combined since 1990, or in some interpretations, during her lifetime. Conclusion: The verdict is mixed. According to Statistics Norway, greenhouse gas emissions in Norway decreased by 4.7% in 2023, which is roughly equivalent to the total reduction since 1990 (9.1% reduction from 1990 levels, with 4.6% of that reduction happening before 2023). However, this comparison depends on the chosen reference year. If you consider other periods, like Astrid Hoem's lifetime (born in 1995) or the peak emission year of 2007, the picture changes. Emissions have decreased by 9.8% since 1995 and 17.4% since 2007, with less than a quarter of the latter reduction occurring in 2023. Furthermore, researcher Borgar Aamaas points out that attributing emission reductions solely to the current government might be misleading due to the complex and long-term nature of climate policies and their effects ¹.;1. Claim: Astrid Hoem, the AUF leader, claims that the Labor Party government has cut greenhouse gas emissions by as much in one year (2023) as all previous governments combined during her lifetime or since 1990. 2. Verdict: Mostly True but Misleading. The claim is true when comparing the 2023 emission reduction to the total reduction since 1990. However, it's misleading because it skips the nuanced picture when looking at other relevant periods, such as the politicians' lifetimes or different government periods. 3. Evidence: Statistics Norway's preliminary figures show a 4.7% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 compared to 2022, which translates to a 2.3 million tonne reduction. The total reduction in emissions from 1990 to 2022 was roughly equivalent to the reduction achieved in 2023, supporting Hoem's claim when using 1990 as a reference point. Emissions have decreased by 9.1% from 1990 levels by 2023, with 4.6% of that reduction happening before 2023. When considering other periods, like the politicians' lifetimes (born in 1995 and 1997), the emission reductions are 9.8% and 14.6%, respectively, since their birth years. Researcher Borgar Aamaas points out that attributing emission reductions solely to the current government might be misleading due to the complex and long-term nature of climate policies and their effects. ;Norwegian Politician’s Claim of Record 2023 Emission Cuts Is True but Misleading;Assertion: Astrid Hoem, leader of AUF, claimed during a debate at Arendal Week that the Labour Party/Socialist Party government cut greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 by as much as all previous governments combined during her and Ola Svenneby’s lifetimes. Specifically, she stated that the emissions cut in 2023 was equivalent to the total cuts achieved from 1990 to 2022. Conclusion: The claim is mixed—partially true but potentially misleading. Evidence from Statistics Norway shows that Norway’s greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 4.7% (2.3 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalents) in 2023 compared to 2022, a significant single-year reduction. This drop matches the total emission reduction from 1990 to 2022, which was 4.6% (increasing to 9.1% by 2023). Thus, Hoem’s claim is technically correct when using 1990 as the reference year, as the 2023 cut is roughly equivalent to the net reduction from 1990 to 2022. However, the claim is misleading because it oversimplifies the emissions trend. Emissions rose from 1990, peaked in 2007, and then gradually declined. When considering other reference years, such as 1995 (Hoem’s birth year, 9.8% reduction to 2023) or 1997 (Svenneby’s birth year, 14.6% reduction to 2023), the 2023 cut is a smaller portion of the total reduction. From 2007 to 2023, emissions fell by 17.4%, with only 23% of that reduction occurring in 2023. Additionally, attributing the 2023 reduction solely to the current government ignores long-term policies (e.g., electric car incentives from the 1990s) and external factors like reduced industrial activity, which complicates credit allocation. Thus, while factually accurate under specific conditions, the claim exaggerates the current government’s impact and overlooks the broader context of emission trends.;1. What is the claim? Astrid Hoem, leader of AUF, claimed during a debate at Arendal Week that the Labour Party/Socialist Party government cut greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 by as much as all previous governments combined during her and Ola Svenneby’s lifetimes. Specifically, she stated that the emissions cut in 2023 was equivalent to the total cuts achieved from 1990 to 2022. 2. What is the verdict? The verdict is mixed—the claim is partially true but potentially misleading. 3. What evidence supports this decision? - Supporting the claim: According to Statistics Norway, Norway’s greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 4.7% (2.3 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalents) in 2023 compared to 2022. This reduction is roughly equivalent to the net emission reduction from 1990 to 2022 (4.6%, increasing to 9.1% by 2023). Thus, Hoem’s claim is factually correct when using 1990 as the reference year, as the 2023 cut matches the total reduction from 1990 to 2022. - Misleading aspects: The claim oversimplifies the emissions trend. Emissions increased from 1990, peaked in 2007, and then gradually declined. When using other reference years, such as 1995 (Hoem’s birth year, 9.8% reduction to 2023) or 1997 (Svenneby’s birth year, 14.6% reduction to 2023), the 2023 cut represents a smaller portion of the total reduction. From 2007 to 2023, emissions fell by 17.4%, with only 23% of that reduction occurring in 2023. - Additional context: Attributing the 2023 reduction solely to the current government is misleading, as emissions are influenced by long-term policies (e.g., electric car incentives from the 1990s) and external factors like reduced industrial and oil/gas activity, as noted by Statistics Norway. Researcher Borgar Aamaas highlights that emission trends result from multiple factors over time, not just the actions of the sitting government. Thus, while the claim is accurate under specific conditions, it exaggerates the current government’s impact and ignores the broader, complex emissions trend.

The most important thing for me is that greenhouse gas emissions are cut, and it is no secret that AUF wants to speed things up even more.";Zero-shot;AUF’s Claim That 2023 Emissions Cuts Equal All Previous Reductions Is Partly True but Misleading;Assertion: Astrid Hoem (AUF) claimed that the Norwegian Labour Party government cut as much greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 alone as all previous governments combined during the lifetimes of youth politicians like herself and Ola Svenneby (Unge Høyre). In other words, the emissions reduction in 2023 was as large as all the reductions from 1990 up to 2022. Conclusion: The claim is partly true but also misleading.  It is true that the 4.7% emissions cut in 2023 was roughly equal to the total reduction in emissions from 1990 to 2022, using 1990 as a baseline (a standard reference year in climate debates).  However, when considering other reference points (like the actual lifetimes of the youth politicians or the peak year 2007), the total reductions under previous governments are larger. For example, emissions have decreased more since 1997 or since the peak in 2007, including significant cuts during the previous Conservative government’s term.  Furthermore, emissions trends result from complex, long-term factors and policies implemented over many years, so attributing all recent reductions solely to the current government is misleading.  Therefore, while the numerical comparison holds under specific assumptions, the broader context shows the claim oversimplifies and somewhat distorts the reality of emissions trends.;Here’s the verdict for the fact-check: 1. What is the claim? Astrid Hoem claimed that the Norwegian Labour Party government cut as much greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 alone as all previous governments combined from 1990 up until 2022 — effectively saying the one-year cut in 2023 equals the total cuts over the entire preceding period. 2. What is the final verdict? The claim is partly true but misleading. 3. What reasoning supports this decision?  The emissions reduction in 2023 (about 4.7%) was approximately equal to the total emissions cut from 1990 to 2022 (about 4.6%), when using 1990 as the baseline — the standard year for climate targets.  However, if the reference period is adjusted to reflect the politicians’ lifetimes or other key years (e.g., 1995, 1997, or the 2007 emissions peak), overall reductions before 2023 are larger, and the 2023 cut is only part of the total decrease.  Emissions trends result from many long-term policies and external factors, making it inaccurate to credit or blame any single government fully for changes observed during their term.  Therefore, while the numerical comparison is factually accurate in a narrow sense, the broader context shows the claim oversimplifies and misrepresents the emissions reductions history.;Fact-Check: AUF's Claim of Lifetime Emission Cuts in One Year — Mixed Verdict;Assertion: Astrid Hoem (AUF) claimed that During the last year of last year [2023], the Labor Party government has cut as much as all the last governments under Ola Svenneby and my lifetime, and later repeated, Now the numbers are very clear. We have cut as much in one year last year as has been cut during our entire lifetime of government terms. Conclusion: Mixed. The claim is partially true but also misleading, depending on the reference point and interpretation.  True (under specific conditions): It is true that the emission cut in 2023 (2.3 million tonnes, 4.7% decrease) was approximately the same size as the total emission cut between 1990 and 2022 (which brought the reduction from 1990 to 4.6%). This aligns with Hoem's clarification that 1990 is their reference year. The 2023 cut increased the total reduction from 1990 to 9.1%.  Misleading (under other conditions):  The claim becomes less accurate when considering other starting points for lifetime. If starting from Hoem's birth year (1995), the 2023 cut is significant, but if starting from Svenneby's birth year (1997) when emissions were higher, the 2023 cut is a smaller part of the total reduction.  The largest single-year cut in absolute terms was actually in 2009 (2.5 million tons), though 2023 had the largest percentage decrease.  Emissions increased after 1990, peaking in 2007. Since 2007, emissions have been reduced by 17.4%, and less than a quarter (23%) of this reduction occurred in 2023. This implies that a larger share of the total cuts since the peak happened under previous governments (e.g., the bourgeois government from 2013-2021).  Emission trends are influenced by many factors over a long period, and current cuts can be attributed to policies implemented by previous governments (e.g., electric car policy). No single government can take full credit for all emission reductions during their term.;Here's the verdict for the fact-check: 1. What is the claim? Astrid Hoem (AUF) claimed that During the last year of last year [2023], the Labor Party government has cut as much as all the last governments under Ola Svenneby and my lifetime, later reiterating, Now the numbers are very clear. We have cut as much in one year last year as has been cut during our entire lifetime of government terms. 2. What is the final verdict? Mixed. 3. What reasoning supports this decision? The claim is partially true when considering the total reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the 1990 baseline to 2022, as the 2023 reduction was indeed approximately equal to the cumulative reduction achieved in the period between 1990 and 2022. This is the specific reference point AUF clarified they were using. However, the claim is also misleading for several reasons:  It presents a simplification that omits the fact that emissions increased for a significant period after 1990 (peaking in 2007) before declining.  When considering the total emission reduction since the peak year of 2007, the 2023 cut represents less than a quarter of the total reduction, implying that a larger share of cuts occurred under previous governments, including the bourgeois government (2013-2021).  The interpretation of our entire lifetime of government terms is highly dependent on the specific birth years of the politicians (Hoem 1995, Svenneby 1997) and the varying emission levels in those years, making the statement less consistently true across different starting points.  Emission reductions are a complex result of long-term policies and economic factors, and not solely attributable to the actions of a single, recent government. Policies enacted by previous administrations (e.g., electric car incentives) contribute to current reductions.;AUF Leader's Claim of Record Emission Cuts: Partly True, But Misleading;Assertion: Astrid Hoem claimed that the Labor Party government cut greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 by as much as all previous governments combined during her lifetime and Ola Svenneby's lifetime. She repeated this claim, stating that her government cut as much in one year as all previous governments combined during their entire government terms. Conclusion: The verdict is mixed. According to Statistics Norway, greenhouse gas emissions in Norway decreased by 4.7% in 2023, which is a significant reduction. When comparing emissions from 1990 to 2023, the reduction is 9.1%, and the cut in 2023 is approximately the same size as the emission cut between 1990 and 2022. However, Borgar Aamaas, a senior researcher at the Cicero Center for Climate Research, points out that Hoem's statement is both correct and misleading. The claim holds up when using 1990 as a reference year, but the picture is more complex when looking at other years. For instance ¹: If we consider Hoem's lifetime (born in 1995), emissions decreased by 9.8% from 1995 to 2023. If we consider Svenneby's lifetime (born in 1997), emissions decreased by 14.6% from 1997 to 2023, making last year's cut a smaller part of the total cut. Since the peak in emissions in 2007, emissions have been reduced by 17.4%, with less than a quarter of this reduction coming from last year's cuts. Aamaas also notes that emissions are influenced by many factors, including local and international politics, business, and societal trends, making it complicated to attribute credit for emissions cuts to any sitting government. Overall, while Hoem's claim is technically correct under certain assumptions, it oversimplifies the complex nature of greenhouse gas emissions trends ¹.;The Claim: Astrid Hoem claimed that the Labor Party government cut greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 by as much as all previous governments combined during her lifetime and Ola Svenneby's lifetime. The Final Verdict: Mixed/Partially True. The claim is both correct and misleading depending on the reference year used. Reasoning: Correct when using 1990 as a reference year: The reduction in emissions from 1990 to 2023 is 9.1%, and the cut in 2023 is approximately the same size as the emission cut between 1990 and 2022. Misleading when considering other time frames: When looking at other periods, such as the youth party leaders' lifetimes (Hoem born in 1995 and Svenneby born in 1997) or the peak emission year of 2007, the claim doesn't hold up as strongly or is less significant. Complexity in attributing emissions cuts: Emissions trends are influenced by various factors, including policies from previous governments, making it challenging to attribute the cuts directly to the current government. Context matters: The claim's validity depends heavily on the chosen reference point and understanding the broader context of emissions trends over time.;AUF Leader's Claim of 2023 Emissions Cuts Matching Lifetime Totals Is True but Misleading;Assertion: Astrid Hoem, leader of AUF, claimed during a debate that the Labour Party/Socialist Party government cut greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 by as much as all previous governments combined during her and Ola Svenneby's lifetimes. Specifically, she stated that the emissions cuts in 2023 equaled the total cuts from 1990 to 2022. Conclusion: The verdict is mixed. The claim is technically correct when using 1990 as the reference year, as Norway's greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 4.7% in 2023 (2.3 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalents), roughly equivalent to the total reduction from 1990 to 2022 (4.6%). However, it is misleading because: 1. Context of Emissions Trends: Emissions increased from 1990, peaked in 2007, and then gradually declined. The 2023 cut (4.7%) is significant but not necessarily greater than all prior cuts combined when considering other reference years. For example, from 1997 (Svenneby’s birth year), emissions decreased by 14.6% by 2023, and from 2007, by 17.4%, with only 23% of that reduction occurring in 2023. 2. Attribution of Cuts: The 2023 reduction is attributed to factors like increased electric vehicle use, reduced industrial activity, and lower oil and gas emissions, influenced by long-term policies from various governments, not solely the current one. Policies from prior governments, including the Conservative-led government (2013–2021), contributed significantly to recent trends. 3. Preliminary Data: The 2023 figures from Statistics Norway are preliminary and may change, with 2009 having a slightly larger cut (2.5 million tonnes). 4. Misleading Implication: Hoem’s claim implies the current government outperformed all others, but the data shows significant reductions occurred under previous governments, especially post-2007. Thus, while the 2023 cut matches the 1990–2022 reduction, the claim oversimplifies a complex emissions trend and exaggerates the current government’s unique impact.;1. Claim: Astrid Hoem, AUF leader, stated that the Labour Party/Socialist Party government cut greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 by as much as all previous governments combined during her and Ola Svenneby’s lifetimes, specifically equaling the total emissions cuts from 1990 to 2022. 2. Final Verdict: Mixed. 3. Reasoning: - Correct in a Specific Context: The claim is technically true when using 1990 as the reference year. Statistics Norway’s preliminary data shows a 4.7% reduction (2.3 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalents) in 2023, roughly equivalent to the 4.6% reduction from 1990 to 2022. - Misleading Overall: The claim oversimplifies emissions trends. Emissions rose from 1990, peaked in 2007, and then declined. From 1997 (Svenneby’s birth year), the total reduction by 2023 was 14.6%, and from 2007, it was 17.4%, with only 23% of that occurring in 2023, indicating significant cuts under prior governments. - Attribution Issues: The 2023 reduction resulted from factors like electric vehicle adoption, reduced industrial activity, and lower oil and gas emissions, driven by long-term policies across multiple governments, not solely the current one. Conservative-led governments (2013–2021) contributed to these trends. - Preliminary Data: The 2023 figures are not final, and 2009 saw a slightly larger cut (2.5 million tonnes), potentially challenging the claim’s uniqueness. - Implication: Hoem’s statement implies the current government outperformed all others, which is misleading given the cumulative impact of prior policies and the complexity of emissions trends. Thus, while the claim holds under specific conditions (1990–2022 comparison), it exaggerates the current government’s role and ignores broader context, making it misleading.

Because even a small change in the amount of CO 2  has an impact on global warming, shows a previous fact check from TjekDet , which includes some of the same claims.CO2 emissions in the big picturePeter Langen , a professor at the Department of Environmental Science at Aarhus University, told TjekDet last year that it is correct that 0.04 percent of the air molecules in the atmosphere are CO2 molecules . But even though the percentage may seem quite small, its significance cannot be ignored. Before we humans started changing things, there was between 0.02 and 0.03 percent CO 2 in the atmosphere. We humans have caused the concentration to increase to 0.04 percent. And this change has contributed greatly to the increase in temperature on Earth, Peter Langen explained to TjekDet.He has previously come across the figure 0.04 percent, where it is used as an argument that human CO2 emissions have no significance in the big picture. So is Sebastian Mernild , who is professor and head of the SDU Climate Cluster at the University of Southern Denmark.He explained to TjekDet that a different unit of measurement is typically used, namely parts per million (ppm), which refers to the concentration of - in this case - CO2 molecules per million molecules in the air. And according to Sebastian Mernild, it will typically fluctuate naturally between 180 ppm when we have an ice age, and 280 ppm when we have an interglacial period , which we have now.CheckedThe rise in CO2 in the atmosphere has caused temperatures to rise. And there is no doubt that human interference plays a significant role, say researchers. Photo: NOAA;Vanilla;Human CO2 Emissions Are Small but Have a Major Impact — Claim That They Don’t Affect Climate Is False;Human CO2 emissions, though a small fraction of total atmospheric CO2, have significantly increased CO2 levels from about 280 ppm pre-industrial to over 420 ppm today, driving global warming.  The argument that human CO2 is negligible because it’s a tiny part of total atmospheric gases ignores the critical role even small changes in CO2 concentration have on Earth's climate.  Europe’s share of global human-caused CO2 emissions is around 6.4% in 2023, much lower than the often-claimed 16%.;The verdict for the fact-check is: False. The claim that human-caused CO2 is too small to influence the climate is incorrect. Although human CO2 emissions represent a small fraction of total atmospheric gases, they have caused a significant increase in CO2 concentration, which drives global warming.;False: The Claim That Human CO2 Emissions Have Absolutely No Influence On Climate Due To Their Small Percentage Is Debunked By Scientists;This fact-check addresses claims that human-made CO2 has no significant influence on the climate because it constitutes a vanishingly small fraction of the total atmospheric CO2. The analysis refutes these claims, presenting the following key points:  The significance of the increase in CO2 concentration: While the total atmospheric CO2 concentration ($0.04\%$ or 400 ppm) may seem small, the increase from the pre-industrial level ($0.02\%$–$0.03\%$ or 280 ppm) to the current level (around 420–425 ppm) is substantial. This change, largely attributed to human activity, has significantly contributed to global temperature increases, according to climate professors Peter Langen, Sebastian Mernild, and Eigil Kaas.  Human responsibility for the increase: Researchers assert that the rise in atmospheric CO2 concentration since the mid-19th century is almost one to one man-made. The UN's climate panel, IPCC, estimates that 1.07 of the 1.09 degrees of temperature increase since 1850 can be attributed to human-made causes, demonstrating a clear link between human activity and global warming.  Correction of CO2 emission figures: The claim in the Facebook posts that Europe contributes 16% of total human-caused CO2 emissions is factually incorrect. According to the EU Commission's Joint Research Center (JRC), the EU member states' share of global CO2 emissions in 2023 was 6.4%.;False. The fact-check identifies the central claim (that human CO2 emissions are insignificant to climate change because they represent a vanishingly small fraction of the total CO2 in the atmosphere) as incorrect. While the total percentage of CO2 in the atmosphere is small, experts cited in the article confirm that the human-caused increase in CO2 concentration (from pre-industrial levels of around 280 ppm to current levels of around 420 ppm) is substantial and is directly responsible for the majority of the observed rise in global temperatures.;Claim that human CO2 emissions are too small to impact climate is false;"The claim that human-caused CO2 emissions are insignificant because they constitute a small fraction of the atmosphere is misleading. Even small changes in CO2 levels can have a significant impact on global warming. The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has increased from 280 ppm to 420 ppm due to human activities, which is far beyond the natural range and has contributed greatly to the increase in temperature on Earth. The claim that Europe contributes 16% of total human-caused CO2 emissions is incorrect; according to the EU Commission's research service, the EU member states' share of world CO2 emissions was 6.4% in 2023. ";Based on the fact-check, the verdict would be: False. The claim that human-caused CO2 emissions have no influence on the climate because they constitute a small fraction of the atmosphere is incorrect. Experts agree that even small changes in CO2 levels can have a significant impact on global warming, and human activities have caused a substantial increase in CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere. Additionally, the claim about Europe's share of world CO2 emissions is also incorrect.;False: Human CO2 Emissions, Not Europe's 16%, Drive Significant Climate Change;"Human-made CO2, though a small fraction (0.0016%) of total atmospheric CO2 (0.04%), significantly impacts global warming, as it has increased CO2 concentrations from 280 ppm to 420 ppm, far beyond natural levels, contributing to a 1.07°C temperature rise since 1850. - Claims on social media downplaying human CO2 emissions as insignificant are misleading, as the increase in CO2 concentration, primarily human-driven, disrupts the climate system, warming both atmosphere and oceans. - The claim that Europe contributes 16% of global human-caused CO2 emissions is inaccurate; the EU's share was 6.4% in 2023, with Germany, France, Italy, Poland, and Spain as the top emitters.";The claim is false.

Photo: NOAA;Ask-me-anything;Claim That Human CO₂ Emissions Are Too Small to Impact Climate Is False, Scientists Confirm Significant Role in Global Warming;"1. Claim being verified: The claim is that human-caused (man-made) CO₂ emissions are insignificant because they constitute a vanishingly small fraction (0.0016%) of the total atmospheric CO₂ concentration (0.04%), implying that humans have no meaningful influence on climate change. 2. Main evidence used to support or refute the claim:  Scientists explain that although CO₂ is a small fraction of the atmosphere, the increase from about 0.02-0.03% pre-industrial levels to 0.04% today is largely due to human activities and has a significant warming effect.  CO₂ concentration measured in parts per million (ppm) has risen from a natural range of 180-280 ppm during ice ages and interglacial periods to over 420 ppm currently, far beyond natural fluctuations.  The IPCC and climate researchers attribute nearly all of the global temperature increase (about 1.07°C of 1.09°C since 1850) to human causes.  The increase in atmospheric CO₂ is “almost one to one” caused by humans, creating a climate imbalance. 3. Verdict and key reasons:  Verdict: The claim is false/misleading.  Reasons: Despite the small percentage of total atmospheric gases, the rise in CO₂ due to humans is significant and directly linked to global warming. The absolute increase in CO₂ concentration, not just its fraction, matters for climate impact. The scientific consensus confirms human emissions are a major driver of recent climate change.  Additionally, the claim that Europe contributes 16% of global human CO₂ emissions is inaccurate; the correct figure is about 6.4%.";Certainly! Here’s the verdict focused on your three questions: 1. What is the claim being verified? The claim is that human-made CO₂ emissions are insignificant to climate change because they represent only a tiny fraction (0.0016%) of the total atmospheric CO₂ (0.04%), suggesting humans have no meaningful influence on the climate. 2. What is the final verdict? False. 3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict?  Although CO₂ is a small part of the atmosphere, the increase from pre-industrial levels (\~0.02-0.03%) to current levels (\~0.04%) is largely due to human activity and has caused significant warming.  CO₂ concentration has risen from natural ranges of 180-280 ppm historically to over 420 ppm today, which is unprecedented in recent history.  The IPCC and climate scientists agree that nearly all of the observed global temperature rise since 1850 is attributable to human-caused CO₂ emissions.  The scale of change, not the absolute fraction of total gases, is what drives climate impact—small changes in CO₂ can have large effects on global temperature.;CO2 does not negate its significant impact on climate change, which is the core finding of the fact-check.;The claim being verified is that humans have no significant influence on the climate because man-made CO2 constitutes a vanishingly small fraction (0.0016 percent) of the total atmospheric CO2 concentration (0.04 percent). - The main evidence used to refute the claim includes expert testimony from climate professors and data regarding atmospheric CO2 concentration in parts per million (ppm). Scientists note that pre-industrial levels were around 280 ppm, while current levels are approximately 420-425 ppm, far exceeding the natural range. This increase, which is attributed almost entirely to human activity, has caused an imbalance in the climate system. - The verdict is that the claims presented in the Facebook posts are false and misleading. The fact-check concludes that even a small change in CO2 concentration has a significant impact on global warming, citing the UN's climate panel (IPCC) assessment that 1.07 degrees of the 1.09-degree average temperature increase since 1850 can be attributed to human-made causes.;The fact-check addresses the claim that humans have negligible influence on the climate because man-made $\text{CO}_2$ is such a small fraction (0.0016%) of the total atmospheric $\text{CO}_2$ concentration (0.04%). The final verdict of the fact-check is False. This verdict is supported by the following evidence and reasoning provided by climate experts:  Significance of Concentration Change (PPM): While the overall percentage of $\text{CO}_2$ in the atmosphere may seem small, experts emphasize that the critical factor is the increase in concentration caused by human activity. They utilize parts per million (ppm) as a more relevant measurement unit. Pre-industrial $\text{CO}_2$ levels naturally fluctuated between 180 ppm (during ice ages) and 280 ppm (interglacial periods). However, the current concentration is approximately 420-425 ppm, which is far beyond the natural range.  Human Activity as the Cause of the Increase: Scientists confirm that the rise in $\text{CO}_2$ concentration from the mid-19th century to the present is almost one to one man-made. This increase creates an imbalance in the climate system, leading to warmer conditions.  Attribution of Warming: The UN's climate panel, the IPCC, has assessed that the average temperature since 1850 has increased by 1.09 degrees Celsius, and 1.07 degrees of that increase can be attributed to human-made causes.;Claim That Human CO2 Emissions Are Insignificant Due to Small Atmospheric Concentration Is False;Claim being verified: The claim being fact-checked is that human-caused CO2 emissions are insignificant and have no influence on climate change because they constitute a vanishingly small fraction (0.0016%) of the total CO2 concentration in the atmosphere (0.04%). Main evidence used: The main evidence used to refute this claim comes from climate experts, including professors Peter Langen, Sebastian Mernild, and Eigil Kaas. They explain that even small changes in CO2 concentrations can have a significant impact on global warming. Specifically, they highlight that human activities have increased CO2 concentrations from pre-industrial levels of around 280 parts per million (ppm) to current levels of around 420 ppm, leading to a significant increase in temperatures. Verdict: The verdict is FALSE. The key reasons behind this verdict are that even small changes in CO2 concentrations can have a significant impact on global warming, and human activities are responsible for the majority of the increase in CO2 concentrations since the mid-19th century. The experts agree that this increase has contributed greatly to the rise in global temperatures, with the UN's climate panel attributing 1.07 degrees of the 1.09-degree average temperature increase since 1850 to human-made causes.;Here are the answers: Claim being verified: The claim being verified is that human-caused CO2 emissions are insignificant and have no influence on climate change because they constitute a small fraction of the total CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. Final verdict: FALSE Evidence or reasoning supporting the verdict: The evidence supporting this verdict includes expert opinions from climate scientists, who explain that: Even small changes in CO2 concentrations can have a significant impact on global warming. Human activities have increased CO2 concentrations from pre-industrial levels of around 280 ppm to current levels of around 420 ppm, leading to a significant increase in temperatures. The UN's climate panel has attributed 1.07 degrees of the 1.09-degree average temperature increase since 1850 to human-made causes. The crucial factor is not the absolute percentage of human-caused CO2 emissions, but rather the significant increase in CO2 concentrations caused by human activities, which has disrupted the climate system's balance.;Social Media Claims of Insignificant Human CO2 Impact on Climate Debunked as False;Claim being verified: Social media posts claim that human-made CO2, constituting only 0.0016% of the total 0.04% CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, has no significant influence on climate change, often accompanied by a graph comparing human CO2 emissions to total atmospheric CO2. - Main evidence used: Experts, including professors from Aarhus University, University of Southern Denmark, and DMI, explain that while CO2 is 0.04% of the atmosphere, human activities have increased it from 0.02–0.03% (180–280 ppm) to 420–425 ppm, significantly contributing to a 1.07°C temperature rise since 1850, as per IPCC assessments. Additionally, the claim that Europe contributes 16% of global CO2 emissions is refuted by the EU’s Joint Research Center, stating Europe’s share was 6.4% in 2023. - Verdict: False. The claim underestimates the impact of human CO2 emissions, as even small increases in CO2 concentration significantly affect global warming. The 16% European emissions figure is also incorrect, as it is much lower at 6.4%.;1. Claim being verified: Social media posts assert that human-made CO2, making up only 0.0016% of the 0.04% total CO2 in the atmosphere, has no significant impact on climate change, often illustrated by a graph comparing human CO2 emissions to total atmospheric CO2. Additionally, the posts claim Europe contributes 16% of global human-caused CO2 emissions. 2. Final verdict: False. 3. Evidence or reasoning supporting the verdict: - Experts from Aarhus University, University of Southern Denmark, and DMI confirm that human activities have increased atmospheric CO2 from 0.02–0.03% (180–280 ppm) to 420–425 ppm, driving a 1.07°C temperature rise since 1850, as per IPCC findings, contradicting the claim that human CO2 emissions are insignificant. - The EU’s Joint Research Center data shows Europe’s CO2 emissions were 6.4% of the global total in 2023, not 16% as claimed, further debunking the posts’ assertions.

Photo: NOAA;Chain-of-Thought;Human CO2 Emissions Are Not “Vanishingly Small” — They Significantly Drive Climate Change, Fact-Check Finds;Claim evaluated: Human-made CO2 constitutes a “vanishingly small fraction” of total atmospheric CO2 (0.0016% of 0.04%) and therefore has no significant impact on climate change, as commonly shared in some Facebook posts with misleading graphs.  Evidence examined: Experts explain that while total CO2 percentage in air seems small, the increase from pre-industrial levels (\~280 ppm) to now (\~420 ppm) is significant and largely caused by humans. This rise correlates strongly with global temperature increase. The claim ignores that even small changes in CO2 concentration can have a major warming effect. Additionally, Europe’s share of global CO2 emissions is about 6.4% in 2023, not 16% as sometimes claimed.  Verdict: The fact-check rejects the claim that human CO2 emissions are insignificant. Scientists confirm that the increase in atmospheric CO2 since the mid-19th century is almost entirely man-made and is a key driver of global warming, disproving the idea that human influence on climate is negligible despite the small percentage of CO2 overall.;Here’s the verdict for the fact-checked claim: 1. Claim being evaluated: That human-made CO2 makes up only a “vanishingly small fraction” of total atmospheric CO2 (0.0016% of 0.04%) and therefore has no meaningful influence on climate change. 2. Key evidence reviewed:  Total atmospheric CO2 is about 0.04% (400+ ppm), but pre-industrial levels were around 0.028% (280 ppm).  Human activity has caused an increase of roughly 140 ppm since the industrial era, pushing levels to over 420 ppm today.  This increase is strongly linked to global temperature rise, with climate experts attributing about 1.07°C of the 1.09°C warming since 1850 to human causes.  Scientific consensus, including the IPCC, confirms that even small increases in CO2 concentration have significant climate effects.  The Facebook posts misinterpret percentages and ignore the crucial difference between total CO2 and the human-caused increase. 3. Verdict: False. The claim that human-made CO2 is insignificant because it constitutes a tiny fraction of total CO2 is misleading and incorrect. Although human CO2 is a small percentage of total atmospheric gases, the increase humans have caused in CO2 concentration is large relative to natural levels and is a primary driver of recent global warming. Scientific evidence clearly shows that this human contribution has a significant and measurable impact on the climate.;False: The claim that a small percentage of atmospheric CO2 means human emissions have no climate influence.;The Claim: The fact-check evaluates the assertion, often shared in Facebook posts, that human-caused CO2 emissions have no significant influence on the climate because they constitute a vanishingly small fraction (stated as 0.0016% of the total CO2 concentration of 0.04% in the atmosphere). The claim concludes that human activity is insignificant in the big picture of climate change.  The Evidence: The fact-check utilizes expert testimony from climate scientists (Peter Langen, Sebastian Mernild, Eigil Kaas) and references official reports (IPCC, JRC). The experts confirm that while CO2 is a small percentage of the atmosphere (around 0.04%), the crucial factor is the increase in concentration caused by humans. They emphasize using parts per million (ppm) as a more relevant measure, noting that the concentration has risen from a natural interglacial range of 180-280 ppm to 420-425 ppm today. This significant increase is attributed almost entirely to human activity since the mid-19th century. The fact-check also corrects a secondary claim, noting that Europe's share of global human-caused CO2 emissions is 6.4% (JRC 2023), not 16%.  The Verdict: The fact-check concludes that the claim is false. Experts agree that even a small change in CO2 concentration, specifically the increase from roughly 0.02-0.03% to 0.04%, has a major impact on global warming. The verdict emphasizes that the rise from 280 ppm to 420-425 ppm is unequivocally human-made and has caused the climate system to warm. The IPCC is cited, attributing 1.07 degrees of the 1.09-degree temperature rise since 1850 to human causes.;The claim that humans have no influence on the climate because man-made CO2 constitutes a vanishingly small fraction of the total atmospheric CO2 concentration is False. 1. The Claim Being Evaluated: The core claim is that human-caused CO2 emissions are insignificant to the climate because they only account for a minute percentage (0.0016%) of the total CO2 concentration (0.04%) in the atmosphere. This claim asserts that human influence on climate change is negligible in the big picture. 2. Key Evidence and Assessment: The fact-check and supporting scientific understanding contradict this claim:  The Importance of the CO2 Increase: While the percentage of CO2 in the atmosphere is small (approximately 0.04%), the critical factor is the change in that concentration. Experts note that pre-industrial levels were significantly lower (around 0.02% to 0.03%). The increase to 0.04% is directly attributed to human activity.  The Role of Parts Per Million (ppm): Scientists prefer using ppm, which illustrates the magnitude of the change more clearly. Atmospheric CO2 levels have risen from a pre-industrial average of about 280 ppm to approximately 420-425 ppm today. This rise is far beyond the natural range observed during historical ice age and interglacial periods.  Direct Correlation between CO2 and Warming: Multiple sources confirm that the increase in CO2 concentration since the mid-19th century is almost entirely human-caused and directly correlates with the rise in global temperatures. The IPCC has assessed that human activity is responsible for a substantial majority (1.07°C of the 1.09°C increase) of global warming since 1850.  The Significance of Greenhouse Gases: CO2 and other greenhouse gases, even in small concentrations, have a disproportionately large impact because they trap heat effectively, creating the greenhouse effect. Nitrogen and oxygen, which make up most of the atmosphere, do not absorb heat in the same way. 3. Verdict and Justification: The claim is False. The argument relies on downplaying the significance of a percentage without acknowledging the dramatic impact of the increase in CO2 concentration. Scientific evidence clearly shows that the rise in atmospheric CO2 levels, driven by human activities, is responsible for the observed warming of the climate system.;Claim about human CO2 emissions being insignificant is false;Claim: The claim being evaluated is that human-caused CO2 emissions are insignificant and have no influence on the climate because they constitute a vanishingly small fraction of 0.0016 percent of the total CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. Evidence: The fact-check presents evidence from climate experts, including Peter Langen, Sebastian Mernild, and Eigil Kaas, who explain that even small changes in CO2 levels can have a significant impact on global warming. They point out that the concentration of CO2 has increased from 280 ppm to 420 ppm due to human activities, which is far beyond the natural range, and that this increase has contributed greatly to the rise in global temperatures. Verdict: The fact-check concludes that the claim is false. The experts agree that human-caused CO2 emissions play a significant role in climate change, and the increase in CO2 levels has caused an imbalance in the climate system. Additionally, the fact-check corrects another claim that Europe contributes 16 percent of total human-caused CO2 emissions, stating that the actual number is 6.4 percent according to the EU Commission's research service. ;Verdict: False The claim being evaluated is that human-caused CO2 emissions are insignificant and have no influence on the climate because they constitute a vanishingly small fraction of the total CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. The key evidence provided includes: Expert opinions from climate scientists Peter Langen, Sebastian Mernild, and Eigil Kaas, who all agree that even small changes in CO2 levels can have a significant impact on global warming. Data showing that the concentration of CO2 has increased from 280 ppm to 420 ppm due to human activities, which is far beyond the natural range. Evidence that this increase in CO2 levels has contributed greatly to the rise in global temperatures, with the UN's climate panel (IPCC) attributing 1.07 degrees of the 1.09 degrees Celsius increase in average temperature since 1850 to human-made causes. Based on this evidence, the claim is deemed false because: The experts agree that human-caused CO2 emissions play a significant role in climate change, contradicting the claim that they have no influence. The data shows that the increase in CO2 levels is not just a small fluctuation, but a significant change that has pushed the concentration far beyond the natural range. The evidence demonstrates a clear link between human-caused CO2 emissions and the rise in global temperatures, making it clear that human activities are having a substantial impact on the climate.;False: Human CO2 Emissions Drive Significant Climate Change, and Europe’s Share Is 6.4%, Not 16%;"Claim Evaluated: Social media posts claim that human-made CO2 constitutes only 0.0016% of the total CO2 in the atmosphere (0.04%), implying it has negligible impact on climate change, and Europe contributes 16% of global human-caused CO2 emissions. - Main Evidence: Experts, including professors from Aarhus University, University of Southern Denmark, and DMI, confirm that while atmospheric CO2 is 0.04% (420 ppm), human activities have increased it from a pre-industrial 280 ppm, significantly driving global warming (1.07°C of 1.09°C rise since 1850). The EU’s CO2 emissions share is 6.4% in 2023 per the EU’s Joint Research Centre, not 16% as claimed. - Verdict: The claim is false. Human-induced CO2 increases, though a small fraction of total atmospheric CO2, have a substantial climate impact, nearly fully accounting for the rise from 280 to 425 ppm, causing significant warming. The 16% EU emissions claim is overstated; the correct figure is 6.4%.";Verdict: False 1. Claim Evaluated: Social media posts assert that human-made CO2 constitutes only 0.0016% of the total CO2 concentration in the atmosphere (0.04%), suggesting it has no significant impact on climate change, and that Europe contributes 16% of global human-caused CO2 emissions. 2. Key Evidence: - Experts (professors from Aarhus University, University of Southern Denmark, and DMI) confirm that atmospheric CO2 is 0.04% (420 ppm), but human activities have increased it from a pre-industrial range of 180–280 ppm to 425 ppm, nearly entirely responsible for this rise. This increase has driven 1.07°C of the 1.09°C global temperature rise since 1850, per the IPCC. - The EU’s share of global CO2 emissions is 6.4% in 2023, according to the EU’s Joint Research Centre, not 16% as claimed. 3. Justification: The claim that human-made CO2 is insignificant is false because, despite being a small fraction of total atmospheric CO2, the human-driven increase from 280 to 425 ppm has significantly warmed the climate, contradicting the assertion of no impact. Additionally, the claim of Europe’s 16% contribution to global emissions is incorrect, as it is only 6.4%. The evidence clearly refutes both parts of the claim.
FC_07;Bullet point summary;Posts about anthropogenic CO2 in the atmosphere use partially correct figures to draw completely wrong conclusions;Man-made CO2 constitutes such a tiny fraction of the atmosphere that it has absolutely no impact on climate change. This is what several Facebook posts say, where CO2's share of the atmosphere is stated to be only 0.04 percent and humans' contribution to only 0.0016 percent of the total CO2 concentration. The numbers in the posts are partially correct. But the conclusion is not, researchers tell TjekDet.;This is the fact-check: How can one ever believe that humans have any influence on the climate in the big picture, when man-made CO2 only constitutes a “vanishingly small fraction” of 0.0016 percent of the total CO2 concentration in the atmosphere of 0.04 percent?This is what is stated in numerous Facebook posts , where the claim is used to downplay the role of humans in climate change. The conclusion in the posts is that the man-made CO 2 in the atmosphere has absolutely no influence.Along with the claims, a graph is shared that supposedly illustrates the composition of the gases that make up the atmosphere. Here, human-caused CO2 emissions - the tiny white dot in the right corner - are compared with the total CO2 concentration - the green dots - in the Earth's atmosphere.ZeroPhoto: Screenshot of Facebook postBut neither the graph nor the numbers are proof that humans' spread of CO 2 in the atmosphere is insignificant. Because even a small change in the amount of CO 2  has an impact on global warming, shows a previous fact check from TjekDet , which includes some of the same claims.CO2 emissions in the big picturePeter Langen , a professor at the Department of Environmental Science at Aarhus University, told TjekDet last year that it is correct that 0.04 percent of the air molecules in the atmosphere are CO2 molecules . But even though the percentage may seem quite small, its significance cannot be ignored. Before we humans started changing things, there was between 0.02 and 0.03 percent CO 2 in the atmosphere. We humans have caused the concentration to increase to 0.04 percent. And this change has contributed greatly to the increase in temperature on Earth, Peter Langen explained to TjekDet.He has previously come across the figure 0.04 percent, where it is used as an argument that human CO2 emissions have no significance in the big picture. So is Sebastian Mernild , who is professor and head of the SDU Climate Cluster at the University of Southern Denmark.He explained to TjekDet that a different unit of measurement is typically used, namely parts per million (ppm), which refers to the concentration of - in this case - CO2 molecules per million molecules in the air. And according to Sebastian Mernild, it will typically fluctuate naturally between 180 ppm when we have an ice age, and 280 ppm when we have an interglacial period , which we have now.CheckedThe rise in CO2 in the atmosphere has caused temperatures to rise. And there is no doubt that human interference plays a significant role, say researchers. Photo: NOAA;Contextual;Human-Made CO₂ Is Not “Vanishingly Small” and Significantly Drives Climate Change — Claim Is False;The claim: Some Facebook posts argue that human-made CO₂ is an insignificant fraction of the atmosphere—only about 0.0016% of total CO₂ (which itself is 0.04% of the atmosphere)—and therefore human emissions have no meaningful impact on climate change.  The evidence: Experts explain that although CO₂ makes up a small percentage of the atmosphere, the increase caused by humans (from about 280 ppm pre-industrial to over 420 ppm today) is significant and closely linked to global temperature rise. Researchers from Aarhus University, the University of Southern Denmark, and Denmark’s National Center for Climate Research emphasize that this rise is almost entirely due to human activity and that even small changes in CO₂ concentration can strongly affect the climate. Additionally, the posts overstate Europe’s share of global emissions, which is actually about 6.4% in 2023, not 16%.  The verdict: The claim is false. Despite human-made CO₂ being a small fraction of the atmosphere, its increase has a major impact on climate change. Scientific consensus shows humans are the primary cause of the recent rise in atmospheric CO₂ and associated warming, disproving the notion that human emissions are insignificant.;Sure! Here’s the final verdict based on your three questions: 1. What is the claim being assessed? The claim is that human-made CO₂ constitutes a “vanishingly small fraction” of total atmospheric CO₂—only about 0.0016% of the atmosphere’s 0.04% CO₂ concentration—and therefore has no significant influence on climate change. 2. What is the verdict? The claim is false. 3. What reasoning or evidence supports this decision? Experts explain that although CO₂ is a small part of the atmosphere, the increase caused by humans (from around 280 ppm before industrialization to over 420 ppm now) is large compared to natural historical fluctuations and is directly linked to global warming. The rise in CO₂ concentration is almost entirely due to human emissions, which have disrupted the climate system and caused significant temperature increases. Scientific consensus, supported by researchers from multiple institutions, confirms that even small changes in CO₂ levels have a major impact on climate, disproving the idea that human contributions are negligible.;Fact Check: Claim That Human CO2 Emissions Are Too Small to Influence Climate Is False;This fact-check addresses claims circulating on social media that human influence on climate change is negligible because man-made CO2 constitutes a vanishingly small fraction of the total atmospheric CO2 concentration. Here is a concise summary of the key findings:  The Claim: The assertion is that humans have no significant influence on the climate because man-made CO2 emissions make up only 0.0016 percent of the total atmospheric CO2 concentration (0.04 percent), a vanishingly small fraction. The claim also incorrectly states that Europe contributes 16 percent of total human-caused CO2 emissions.  The Evidence: While the percentage of CO2 in the atmosphere is small (around 0.04 percent), scientists emphasize the crucial impact of the increase caused by human activity. Pre-industrial CO2 levels were between 0.02 and 0.03 percent (or 280 ppm), but human activity has raised it to 0.04 percent (currently around 420 ppm). Researchers state that this rise is significantly beyond the natural range and directly correlates with rising global temperatures. The fact-check also corrects the claim about Europe's emissions, citing the EU Commission's Joint Research Center (JRC) which reports the EU's share of global CO2 emissions as 6.4 percent in 2023, not 16 percent.  The Verdict: The conclusion that human-made CO2 has absolutely no influence on the climate is False. The fact-check provides strong evidence from climate scientists (Peter Langen, Sebastian Mernild, Eigil Kaas) confirming that the significant increase in atmospheric CO2 since the mid-19th century is almost entirely man-made, causing an imbalance in the climate system and contributing substantially to global warming.;Based on the provided fact-check, here is the assessment of the claim: 1. What is the claim being assessed? The claim being assessed, which appeared in numerous Facebook posts, argues that humans have no influence on the climate because man-made CO2 constitutes a vanishingly small fraction of the total CO2 concentration in the atmosphere (specifically, 0.0016 percent of the total 0.04 percent). The posts conclude that man-made CO2 has absolutely no influence. 2. What is the verdict (true/false/mixed/other relevant verdict category)? The verdict is False. 3. What reasoning or evidence supports this decision? The fact-check refutes the claim by presenting evidence from climate researchers who emphasize that the change in CO2 concentration, rather than the total percentage, is the crucial factor.  Human Contribution to CO2 Increase: Experts explain that the natural pre-industrial CO2 level was between 0.02 and 0.03 percent. The rise to the current 0.04 percent is directly attributed to human activity and has contributed greatly to the increase in temperature on Earth.  PPM Measurement and Natural Range: Using the standard measurement of parts per million (ppm), scientists note that natural CO2 concentrations fluctuate between 180 ppm (ice age) and 280 ppm (interglacial period). The current level of 420 ppm is far beyond the natural range, and this rise is unequivocally linked to human influence.  Temperature Attribution: The fact-check cites the IPCC assessment, which concluded that of the 1.09 degrees increase in average temperature since 1850, 1.07 degrees can be attributed to human-made causes.  Human Responsibility for the Increase: Researchers state that the change in concentration in the atmosphere from the mid-19th century until now is almost one to one man-made, illustrating that human emissions are responsible for the vast majority of the CO2 increase, leading to an imbalance in the climate system.;Claim that Human CO2 Emissions are Insignificant Due to Small Atmospheric Concentration is FALSE;The claim: The claim being assessed is that human-caused CO2 emissions are insignificant and have no influence on climate change because they constitute a vanishingly small fraction of 0.0016 percent of the total CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. This claim is used to downplay the role of humans in climate change. The evidence: The evidence provided includes expert opinions from professors Peter Langen, Sebastian Mernild, and Eigil Kaas, who explain that even small changes in CO2 concentrations can have a significant impact on global warming. Key data points include: CO2 concentrations have increased from 280 ppm to 420 ppm due to human activities, and this increase has contributed greatly to the rise in global temperatures (1.07 out of 1.09 degrees since 1850). The experts also note that the crucial factor is not the absolute percentage of CO2 in the atmosphere but rather the significant change in CO2 concentrations caused by human activities. The verdict: The verdict is that the claim is false. The evidence shows that human-caused CO2 emissions do have a significant impact on climate change, despite constituting a small fraction of the total atmosphere. The experts agree that the increase in CO2 concentrations is largely due to human activities and has contributed substantially to global warming. ;Based on the fact-check, here are the answers to the three questions: The claim being assessed: The claim being assessed is that human-caused CO2 emissions have no influence on climate change because they constitute a small fraction (0.0016 percent) of the total CO2 concentration in the atmosphere (0.04 percent). The verdict: The verdict is FALSE. Reasoning or evidence: The reasoning or evidence that supports this decision is that experts in climate science (Peter Langen, Sebastian Mernild, and Eigil Kaas) explain that even small changes in CO2 concentrations can have a significant impact on global warming. They point out that human activities have increased CO2 concentrations from 280 ppm to 420 ppm, which is far beyond the natural range, and this increase has contributed greatly to the rise in global temperatures. Specifically, the UN's climate panel (IPCC) has assessed that 1.07 out of 1.09 degrees of the average temperature increase since 1850 can be attributed to human-made causes.

Photo: NOAA;Least-to-most ;Claim That Human CO2 Is Too Small to Affect Climate Change Is False, Science Shows Significant Impact;"The claim that human-produced CO2 is too minuscule to affect the climate is false. While CO2 constitutes only about 0.04% of the atmosphere, the pre-industrial concentration was roughly half that amount. Human activity has increased CO2 levels to about 420 ppm, significantly beyond natural historical ranges of 180-280 ppm. This increase has directly contributed to a rise in global temperatures by about 1.09°C since the 19th century, with over 1°C attributed to human causes. Experts agree that the recent rise in atmospheric CO2 concentration is overwhelmingly due to human emissions, causing climate imbalance. Additionally, the claim that Europe contributes 16% of global human-caused CO2 emissions is incorrect; the actual share is closer to 6.4%. Therefore, despite the small fraction of CO2 in the atmosphere, the human impact is substantial and scientifically supported.";Certainly! Here’s the verdict breakdown: 1. What is the claim being evaluated? The claim is that human-produced CO2 is such a tiny fraction of the atmosphere’s total CO2 (only about 0.0016% of 0.04%) that it has no meaningful influence on climate change. 2. Based on the evidence provided, is the claim true, false, mixed or another verdict category? The claim is false. 3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict?  Human activity has increased atmospheric CO2 from about 0.02–0.03% pre-industrial levels to roughly 0.04%, a significant relative increase.  CO2 concentrations have risen to about 420 ppm, far beyond natural historical fluctuations (180–280 ppm).  This rise correlates strongly with global temperature increases, with scientific consensus attributing roughly 1.07°C of the 1.09°C warming since 1850 to human causes.  Experts confirm the increase in CO2 concentration is almost entirely man-made and impacts the climate system significantly. ---  Final Verdict: The claim that human-produced CO2 is too insignificant in the atmosphere to influence climate change is false. Although the fraction of CO2 in the atmosphere is small, the increase caused by human emissions is substantial relative to natural levels and has driven significant global warming. The scientific evidence clearly shows that human CO2 emissions have a meaningful and measurable impact on the climate.;Fact Check: Claims That Human-Caused CO2 Is Too Small to Influence Climate Are False;"Fact-Check Summary: Human Influence on Climate and CO2 Concentrations 1. Verdict: False. 2. Evidence: The claim is refuted by expert analysis and data demonstrating that the increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration, driven by human activity, is the primary cause of global warming. Key evidence includes:  Significant increase in CO2 concentration: Although CO2 makes up approximately 0.04% of the atmosphere, human activities have caused a substantial increase from pre-industrial levels of 0.02% to 0.03%.  Measurement in Parts Per Million (PPM): Scientists typically use ppm to measure CO2 concentration. While the natural range fluctuates around 280 ppm during interglacial periods, the current level is approximately 420 ppm, significantly beyond the natural range.  Human responsibility for the increase: Researchers assert that the increase in CO2 concentration from the mid-19th century to the present is almost one to one man-made, creating an imbalance in the climate system.  Attribution of warming: The UN's climate panel, IPCC, has assessed that 1.07 degrees of the 1.09-degree average temperature increase since 1850 can be attributed to human causes.  Correction on EU emissions: A secondary claim in the posts—that Europe contributes 16% of global human-caused CO2 emissions—is incorrect; the EU member states' share was 6.4% in 2023, according to the JRC. 3. Claim: The main statement being fact-checked is that humans cannot have any influence on the climate because man-made CO2 constitutes a vanishingly small fraction (0.0016%) of the total CO2 concentration (0.04%) in the atmosphere.   Cohesive Summary The claim that human CO2 emissions have an insignificant impact on the climate because they represent a vanishingly small fraction of the atmosphere is False. While Facebook posts correctly state that CO2 constitutes roughly 0.04% of the atmosphere, this figure is misleading when used to downplay human influence. Scientific evidence and expert testimony confirm that even a small change in CO2 concentration has a profound impact on global warming. Scientists emphasize that human activities have increased atmospheric CO2 from a pre-industrial level of 0.02%–0.03% to the current 0.04%. Furthermore, climate experts, who measure concentration in parts per million (ppm), point out that CO2 levels have risen dramatically from a natural fluctuation range (around 280 ppm) to approximately 420 ppm, a change unequivocally attributed to human intervention. This imbalance in the climate system is directly linked to rising temperatures; the IPCC assesses that humans are responsible for the vast majority (1.07 degrees) of the average temperature increase observed since 1850.";1. What is the claim being evaluated? The claim being evaluated is that humans have no significant influence on the climate because man-made CO2 constitutes a vanishingly small fraction (specifically cited as 0.0016%) of the total CO2 concentration (0.04%) in the atmosphere. 2. Based on the evidence provided, is the claim true, false, mixed or another verdict category? Based on the evidence provided, the claim is False. 3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict? The fact-check and expert testimonies directly refute the claim that human CO2 emissions are insignificant. While the total percentage of CO2 in the atmosphere is low (0.04%), the evidence highlights that human activity is responsible for a significant increase in this concentration from pre-industrial levels. The key evidence supporting the False verdict includes:  PPM as a key metric: Scientists typically use parts per million (ppm) for measurement, where the concentration has risen from a natural interglacial range of around 280 ppm to approximately 420 ppm today.  Human-caused increase: Experts confirm that this increase—from approximately 280 ppm to 425 ppm since the mid-19th century—is almost one to one man-made.  Impact on temperature: Researchers state that this human-caused rise in CO2 has created an imbalance in the climate system and contributed greatly to the increase in global temperature.  IPCC attribution: The UN's climate panel (IPCC) attributes 1.07 degrees of the 1.09-degree temperature increase since 1850 to human-made causes. The verdict is that the claim is False, as the evidence demonstrates that the human-caused increase in CO2 concentration, despite being a small fraction of the atmosphere, has a profound and measurable influence on the climate system.;Claim That Human CO2 Emissions Have 'No Influence' on Climate Change Is False;Verdict: False. Evidence: The small percentage of CO2 in the atmosphere (0.04%) doesn't mean its impact is insignificant, as even a small change in CO2 levels can have a significant impact on global warming. Human activities have increased CO2 levels from 280 ppm to 420 ppm, far beyond the natural range. Researchers agree that human interference plays a significant role in climate change, with the UN's climate panel attributing 1.07 degrees of the 1.09 degrees average temperature increase since 1850 to human-made causes. Claim: The claim is that human-caused CO2 emissions are insignificant and have no influence on the climate due to being a vanishingly small fraction of the total CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. Here's a cohesive summary: The claim that human-caused CO2 emissions are insignificant and have no influence on the climate due to being a small fraction of the total CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is false. Despite CO2 making up only 0.04% of the atmosphere, researchers emphasize that even small changes in CO2 levels can have a significant impact on global warming. Evidence shows that human activities have increased CO2 levels from 280 ppm to 420 ppm, far beyond the natural range, and this change has contributed greatly to the increase in temperature on Earth. According to the UN's climate panel, human-made causes are responsible for 1.07 degrees of the 1.09 degrees average temperature increase since 1850. The fact-check highlights that the development of CO2 in the atmosphere, not just its percentage, is crucial in understanding its impact on climate change.;Here are brief answers to each question: What is the claim being evaluated? The claim is that human-caused CO2 emissions are insignificant and have no influence on the climate due to being a vanishingly small fraction of the total CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. Based on the evidence provided, is the claim true, false, mixed or another verdict category? False. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict? The evidence shows that even small changes in CO2 levels can have a significant impact on global warming.

Researchers agree that human interference plays a significant role in climate change, with the UN's climate panel attributing 1.07 degrees of the 1.09 degrees average temperature increase since 1850 to human-made causes. Final Verdict: The claim that human-caused CO2 emissions are insignificant and have no influence on the climate is FALSE. The evidence shows that human activities have significantly increased CO2 levels, leading to a substantial impact on global warming, contrary to the claim's assertion that human-caused CO2 emissions have no influence.;False: Human CO2 Emissions Not 'Insignificant' at 0.0016%, and Europe’s Share Is 6.4%, Not 16%;"1. Verdict: The claim is false. 2. Evidence: - The claim that man-made CO2 constitutes only 0.0016% of total CO2 (0.04% of the atmosphere) is misleading. While CO2 is 0.04% of the atmosphere, human activity has increased it from 0.02–0.03% (280 ppm) to 420–425 ppm, significantly impacting global warming. - Experts (Peter Langen, Sebastian Mernild, Eigil Kaas) confirm that this increase, almost entirely human-driven, has caused a 1.07°C temperature rise since 1850, per the IPCC. - The claim that Europe contributes 16% of global human-caused CO2 emissions is incorrect; the EU’s share was 6.4% in 2023, per the EU Commission’s Joint Research Center. 3. Claim: Human-made CO2 is only 0.0016% of total CO2 in the atmosphere (0.04%), implying it has no significant impact on climate change, and Europe contributes 16% of global human-caused CO2 emissions. Summary: The claim that human-made CO2, allegedly only 0.0016% of total CO2 (0.04% of the atmosphere), has no significant impact on climate change is false, as is the assertion that Europe accounts for 16% of global human-caused CO2 emissions. Experts, including Peter Langen, Sebastian Mernild, and Eigil Kaas, emphasize that human activity has increased atmospheric CO2 from 280 ppm to 420–425 ppm, driving a 1.07°C temperature rise since 1850, as confirmed by the IPCC. This significant human-driven increase contradicts the claim of negligible impact. Additionally, the EU’s contribution to global CO2 emissions is 6.4% (2023, Joint Research Center), not 16% as claimed. The evidence clearly shows that human CO2 emissions substantially influence climate change, and the exaggerated European emission share is incorrect, leading to a false verdict for the claim.";"1. What is the claim being evaluated? The claim asserts that human-made CO2 constitutes only 0.0016% of total CO2 in the atmosphere (0.04%), implying it has no significant impact on climate change, and that Europe contributes 16% of global human-caused CO2 emissions. 2. Based on the evidence provided, is the claim true, false, mixed, or another verdict category? The claim is false. 3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict? - The assertion that human-made CO2 is only 0.0016% of total CO2 and thus insignificant is misleading. Experts confirm that human activity has increased atmospheric CO2 from 0.02–0.03% (280 ppm) to 420–425 ppm, driving a 1.07°C temperature rise since 1850, per the IPCC, demonstrating significant climate impact. - The claim that Europe contributes 16% of global human-caused CO2 emissions is incorrect; the EU’s share was 6.4% in 2023, according to the EU Commission’s Joint Research Center. - These inaccuracies show the claim misrepresents both the scale and impact of human CO2 emissions and Europe’s contribution. Final Verdict: The claim is false. It inaccurately states that human-made CO2 is only 0.0016% of total CO2 and has no significant climate impact, while experts confirm human-driven CO2 increases from 280 ppm to 420–425 ppm have caused substantial warming (1.07°C since 1850, per the IPCC). Additionally, the claim overstates Europe’s contribution to global CO2 emissions at 16%, when it is actually 6.4% (2023, Joint Research Center). These misrepresentations confirm the claim’s falsehood."
FC_07;Bullet point summary;Posts about anthropogenic CO2 in the atmosphere use partially correct figures to draw completely wrong conclusions;Man-made CO2 constitutes such a tiny fraction of the atmosphere that it has absolutely no impact on climate change. This is what several Facebook posts say, where CO2's share of the atmosphere is stated to be only 0.04 percent and humans' contribution to only 0.0016 percent of the total CO2 concentration. The numbers in the posts are partially correct. But the conclusion is not, researchers tell TjekDet.;This is the fact-check: How can one ever believe that humans have any influence on the climate in the big picture, when man-made CO2 only constitutes a “vanishingly small fraction” of 0.0016 percent of the total CO2 concentration in the atmosphere of 0.04 percent?This is what is stated in numerous Facebook posts , where the claim is used to downplay the role of humans in climate change. The conclusion in the posts is that the man-made CO 2 in the atmosphere has absolutely no influence.Along with the claims, a graph is shared that supposedly illustrates the composition of the gases that make up the atmosphere. Here, human-caused CO2 emissions - the tiny white dot in the right corner - are compared with the total CO2 concentration - the green dots - in the Earth's atmosphere.ZeroPhoto: Screenshot of Facebook postBut neither the graph nor the numbers are proof that humans' spread of CO 2 in the atmosphere is insignificant. Because even a small change in the amount of CO 2  has an impact on global warming, shows a previous fact check from TjekDet , which includes some of the same claims.CO2 emissions in the big picturePeter Langen , a professor at the Department of Environmental Science at Aarhus University, told TjekDet last year that it is correct that 0.04 percent of the air molecules in the atmosphere are CO2 molecules . But even though the percentage may seem quite small, its significance cannot be ignored. Before we humans started changing things, there was between 0.02 and 0.03 percent CO 2 in the atmosphere. We humans have caused the concentration to increase to 0.04 percent. And this change has contributed greatly to the increase in temperature on Earth, Peter Langen explained to TjekDet.He has previously come across the figure 0.04 percent, where it is used as an argument that human CO2 emissions have no significance in the big picture. So is Sebastian Mernild , who is professor and head of the SDU Climate Cluster at the University of Southern Denmark.He explained to TjekDet that a different unit of measurement is typically used, namely parts per million (ppm), which refers to the concentration of - in this case - CO2 molecules per million molecules in the air. And according to Sebastian Mernild, it will typically fluctuate naturally between 180 ppm when we have an ice age, and 280 ppm when we have an interglacial period , which we have now.CheckedThe rise in CO2 in the atmosphere has caused temperatures to rise. And there is no doubt that human interference plays a significant role, say researchers. Photo: NOAA;Role;Small Percentage, Big Impact: Human CO2 Emissions Are Driving Climate Change Despite Their Low Atmospheric Fraction;"Claim: The claim evaluated is that human-made CO2 is an insignificant fraction of the total atmospheric CO2—only about 0.0016%—so it has no meaningful influence on climate change. Evidence:  Although human-made CO2 is a small fraction compared to the total CO2 concentration (about 0.04% of the atmosphere), before industrialization, atmospheric CO2 levels were around 0.02-0.03%. Human activity has raised this to 0.04%, nearly doubling the concentration.  Scientists explain that even small increases in CO2 levels significantly impact global temperatures because CO2 traps heat.  CO2 concentration is more accurately measured in parts per million (ppm), which has risen from natural historical levels of 180–280 ppm during ice ages and interglacial periods to over 420 ppm today due to human emissions.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) attributes about 1.07°C of the 1.09°C global temperature increase since 1850 to human causes.  The increase in atmospheric CO2 since the mid-19th century is almost entirely due to human activity, creating a climate imbalance.  Additionally, the Facebook post's claim that Europe contributes 16% of human-caused CO2 emissions is incorrect; recent data shows the EU’s share is about 6.4%. Verdict: False. The fact-check clearly shows that while human-made CO2 is a small percentage of the total atmosphere, the increase caused by humans is significant and is the primary driver of recent global warming. The claim that human CO2 emissions have no impact is misleading and incorrect.";1. Claim: Human-made CO2 is such a tiny fraction of the atmosphere (0.0016% of total CO2, which itself is 0.04% of air) that it has no meaningful influence on climate change. 2. Final verdict: False. 3. Explanation: The evidence shows that although human-made CO2 is a small fraction of the total atmospheric gases, it has caused the CO2 concentration to nearly double from pre-industrial levels (about 0.02-0.03% to 0.04%). This increase is significant enough to drive global warming, as CO2 is a powerful greenhouse gas. Scientific measurements in parts per million (ppm) reveal that current levels (\~420 ppm) far exceed natural historical variations and correlate strongly with the observed rise in global temperatures, which experts attribute primarily to human activity. Therefore, the claim that human CO2 emissions are insignificant and have no effect on climate is incorrect.;Experts Refute Claim That 'Vanishingly Small Fraction' of Man-Made CO2 Has No Influence on Climate;Claim: Facebook posts assert that human-made CO2 constitutes a vanishingly small fraction (0.0016 percent of the total CO2 concentration of 0.04 percent in the atmosphere) and therefore has no influence on climate change. Some posts also claim Europe contributes 16 percent of total human-caused CO2 emissions. Evidence:  Regarding CO2 influence: Experts explain that while CO2 is a small percentage of the atmosphere, human activity has significantly increased its concentration from a natural range of 0.02-0.03 percent to 0.04 percent. This increase, measured in parts per million (ppm), shows a rise from a natural fluctuation of 180-280 ppm to a current level of 420 ppm. This change is directly linked to global warming. The UN's IPCC has attributed 1.07 degrees of the 1.09-degree temperature increase since 1850 to human causes. Researchers state that the increase in atmospheric CO2 from the mid-19th century (around 280 ppm) to now (around 425 ppm) is almost entirely man-made, creating an imbalance in the climate system.  Regarding Europe's emissions: The latest report from the EU Commission's Joint Research Center (JRC) indicates that EU member states' share of world CO2 emissions was 6.4 percent in 2023, not 16 percent. Verdict: Both claims are false. Even a small change in atmospheric CO2 concentration due to human activity has a significant impact on global warming, and Europe's share of global CO2 emissions is considerably lower than claimed.;1. What is the claim being assessed? The claim being assessed is that human activity has no significant influence on the climate because man-made CO2 constitutes a vanishingly small fraction of the total CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. Specifically, posts circulating on Facebook argue that since CO2 makes up only 0.04 percent of the atmosphere, and man-made CO2 accounts for only 0.0016 percent of that total, human emissions are insignificant to the climate in the big picture. 2. What is the final verdict? False. 3. Explain how the evidence supports the verdict in a clear and concise manner. The evidence provided by climate professors and researchers directly contradicts the claim that human CO2 emissions are insignificant. While the figure of 0.04 percent of the atmosphere being CO2 is correct, the crucial factor is the increase in concentration caused by human activity. Experts explain that before human interference, the atmospheric CO2 concentration was significantly lower, fluctuating naturally between 180 and 280 parts per million (ppm). However, human emissions have raised the concentration to 420 ppm, which is far beyond the natural range. This rise has created an imbalance in the climate system, leading to warmer conditions. According to the UN's climate panel, the IPCC, as cited in the fact-check, the average global temperature has increased by 1.09 degrees since 1850, and 1.07 of those degrees can be attributed to human-made causes. The experts emphasize that the increase in CO2 concentration from the mid-19th century to the present is almost one to one man-made. Therefore, even though the percentage of CO2 in the atmosphere may appear small, the human-caused increase has had a substantial and measurable impact on global warming.;Claim That Human CO2 Emissions Have No Impact on Climate Change Is False Meta AI response: Claim That Human CO2 Emissions Have No Impact on Climate Change Is False;Claim: The claim being evaluated is that human-caused CO2 emissions constitute a vanishingly small fraction of the total CO2 concentration in the atmosphere and therefore have no influence on climate change. Evidence: Experts, including professors Peter Langen, Sebastian Mernild, and Eigil Kaas, agree that while CO2 makes up a small percentage (0.04%) of the atmosphere, human activities have significantly increased CO2 concentrations from pre-industrial levels (around 280 ppm) to current levels (around 420 ppm). This increase is attributed to human activities and has contributed greatly to global warming. The UN's climate panel (IPCC) has assessed that human-made causes are responsible for a significant portion (1.07 out of 1.09 degrees) of the average temperature increase since 1850. Verdict: False. The evidence shows that even though human-caused CO2 emissions may seem small in proportion to the total atmosphere, they have a significant impact on global warming due to the substantial increase in CO2 concentrations caused by human activities. Experts agree that this increase has contributed greatly to the rise in global temperatures, contradicting the claim that human-caused CO2 emissions have no influence on climate change.;Claim: The claim being assessed is that human-caused CO2 emissions are insignificant and have no influence on climate change because they constitute a vanishingly small fraction of the total CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. 2. Verdict: False 3. Explanation: The evidence from climate experts and scientists shows that although human-caused CO2 emissions may make up a small percentage of the atmosphere, the significant increase in CO2 concentrations from pre-industrial levels (around 280 ppm) to current levels (around 420 ppm) due to human activities has had a substantial impact on global warming. The experts agree that this increase has contributed greatly to the rise in global temperatures, and the UN's climate panel (IPCC) attributes a significant portion of the temperature increase since 1850 to human-made causes. This evidence contradicts the claim that human-caused CO2 emissions have no influence on climate change, rendering the claim false.;False: Human-Made CO2 Significantly Impacts Climate, and Europe's CO2 Emissions Are 6.4%, Not 16%;Claim: Social media posts claim that human-made CO2 constitutes only 0.0016% of the total CO2 concentration in the atmosphere (0.04%), suggesting it has no significant impact on climate change. Additionally, the posts claim Europe contributes 16% of global human-caused CO2 emissions. Evidence: - The fact-check confirms that CO2 makes up 0.04% of the atmosphere, but experts note that human activity has increased this from a pre-industrial range of 0.02–0.03% to 0.04% (420 ppm). This increase, though seemingly small, significantly contributes to global warming, as CO2 is a potent greenhouse gas. - Experts, including professors from Aarhus University, the University of Southern Denmark, and DMI, emphasize that the rise from 280 ppm to 425 ppm is almost entirely human-driven, causing a 1.07°C temperature increase since 1850, per the IPCC. - The claim about Europe’s CO2 emissions is incorrect. The EU’s Joint Research Centre reports the EU’s share of global CO2 emissions in 2023 was 6.4%, not 16% as claimed. Verdict: False. The claim that human-made CO2 is insignificant due to its small proportion is misleading, as even small increases in CO2 concentration have a substantial impact on global warming. The assertion about Europe’s 16% share of global emissions is also false, as the correct figure is 6.4%.;Claim: Social media posts assert that human-made CO2, constituting only 0.0016% of the total 0.04% CO2 in the atmosphere, has no significant impact on climate change. Additionally, they claim Europe contributes 16% of global human-caused CO2 emissions. Verdict: False. Explanation: The evidence shows that while CO2 is 0.04% of the atmosphere (420 ppm), human activity has increased it from a pre-industrial 280 ppm, driving nearly all of the 1.07°C global temperature rise since 1850, per the IPCC. This refutes the claim that human-made CO2 is insignificant, as even small increases have a substantial warming effect. The claim about Europe’s 16% share of global emissions is also false, as the EU’s Joint Research Centre reports it was 6.4% in 2023. Both claims are incorrect, supporting the false verdict.

Key Evidence:  Although CO2 makes up about 0.04% of the atmosphere, pre-industrial levels were around 0.02-0.03%. Human activity has raised this to about 0.04%, which is significant.  CO2 concentrations are better measured in parts per million (ppm); natural fluctuations range from 180 to 280 ppm, but current levels exceed 420 ppm due to human emissions.  Scientists confirm this increase is strongly linked to global temperature rises, with about 1.07°C of the 1.09°C increase since 1850 attributed to humans.  The rise in atmospheric CO2 from 280 ppm to 425 ppm is nearly entirely caused by humans, creating an imbalance that drives climate change.  The claim that Europe accounts for 16% of global human CO2 emissions is incorrect; the actual figure is closer to 6.4% as of 2023.  Verdict: The claim is false. Despite the small percentage of CO2 in the atmosphere, the human contribution to the increase in CO2 concentration is significant and directly linked to global warming.

Claim being evaluated: That human-made CO2 is such a tiny fraction of the atmosphere’s total CO2 (0.0016% of 0.04%) that it has no meaningful influence on climate change. 2. Verdict: False. 3. Explanation: Although human-produced CO2 makes up a small fraction of total atmospheric gases, it has significantly increased CO2 concentration from about 280 ppm pre-industrially to over 420 ppm today. This rise is almost entirely due to human activity and is strongly linked to global warming. The small percentage cited ignores the critical role that even minor increases in CO2 play in Earth's climate system.;Fact Check: Claim That Vanishingly Small Human CO2 Emissions Have No Climate Influence Is False;Claim: The claim, frequently circulated in social media posts, asserts that human-caused CO2 has no significant influence on climate change because it constitutes a vanishingly small fraction (specifically, 0.0016%) of the atmosphere's total CO2 concentration (0.04%). These posts often include a graph comparing human emissions to the total atmospheric CO2, concluding that human activity is insignificant. Additionally, some posts claim Europe contributes 16% of global human-caused CO2 emissions. Assessment and Evidence: The fact-check refutes the claim that human-caused CO2 is insignificant, relying on expert analysis and established climate science metrics.  CO2 Concentration and Climate Impact: While the atmosphere's total CO2 concentration is indeed small (around 0.04%), climate scientists emphasize that even minor changes to this percentage have a major impact. According to Peter Langen, a professor at Aarhus University, pre-industrial CO2 levels were between 0.02% and 0.03%. The increase to 0.04% is attributed to human activity and has significantly contributed to rising global temperatures.  The PPM Metric and Human Influence: Sebastian Mernild, head of the SDU Climate Cluster, points out that the standard measurement for atmospheric concentration is parts per million (ppm). Naturally occurring CO2 fluctuates between 180 ppm (during ice ages) and 280 ppm (interglacial periods). Currently, the concentration is around 420 ppm, far exceeding the natural range. Mernild confirms that this increase, driven unequivocally by humans, is warming the climate system.  The Cause of Increased CO2: Eigil Kaas, head of the National Center for Climate Research at DMI, asserts that the increase in CO2 concentration from the mid-19th century—specifically the jump from about 280 ppm to 425 ppm—is almost entirely man-made. This rapid increase has created an imbalance in the climate system. The UN's IPCC estimates that 1.07 of the 1.09 degrees Celsius temperature rise since 1850 is attributable to human causes.  Europe's Emissions Share: The claim that Europe contributes 16% of global human-caused CO2 emissions is factually incorrect. According to the EU Commission’s Joint Research Center (JRC), the EU member states' share of world CO2 emissions was 6.4% in 2023. Verdict: The claim that human-caused CO2 has no influence on climate change due to its small atmospheric percentage is False. Scientific evidence and expert consensus confirm that while the percentage may seem small, the increase caused by human activity is responsible for the significant rise in global temperatures. The claim regarding Europe’s CO2 contribution is also False.;1. What is the claim being evaluated? The claim being evaluated, circulated in numerous Facebook posts, is that humans have no influence on the climate because man-made CO2 constitutes a vanishingly small fraction (0.0016%) of the total atmospheric CO2 concentration (0.04%), rendering it insignificant in the big picture. 2. Is the claim true, false, or mixed? The claim is False. 3. Provide a brief explanation for your decision based on the evidence presented in the fact-check. The fact-check demonstrates that while the percentage of CO2 in the atmosphere may appear small, the increase caused by human activity is highly significant and directly responsible for climate warming. Experts cited in the fact-check confirm that the concentration of CO2 has risen from a natural range of 180-280 ppm to a current level of approximately 420-425 ppm, a rise that is almost entirely man-made. This increase has created an imbalance in the climate system, with the IPCC attributing 1.07 degrees of the 1.09-degree temperature rise since 1850 to human causes. Therefore, the argument that human-caused CO2 is insignificant because it is a small percentage of the total concentration is incorrect. (The fact-check also notes that the claim that Europe contributes 16% of global human-caused CO2 emissions is false, with the actual figure being 6.4% in 2023.);Claim that human CO2 emissions are insignificant due to small atmospheric concentration is FALSE;Claim being evaluated: Facebook posts claim that human-caused CO2 emissions are insignificant because they constitute a vanishingly small fraction of 0.0016% of the total CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, which is 0.04%. The posts also claim that Europe contributes 16% of total human-caused CO2 emissions. Key evidence used to assess the claim: Expert opinions from climate scientists Peter Langen, Sebastian Mernild, and Eigil Kaas, who argue that even small changes in CO2 levels can have a significant impact on global warming. Historical data on CO2 concentrations, which show that human activities have increased CO2 levels from 280 ppm to 420 ppm, far beyond the natural range.

Report from the EU Commission's Joint Research Center (JRC) stating that EU member states' share of world CO2 emissions was 6.4% in 2023, not 16%. Verdict: FALSE. The evidence suggests that human-caused CO2 emissions do have a significant impact on global warming, despite constituting a small fraction of the atmosphere. Additionally, the claim about Europe's share of CO2 emissions is also incorrect, with the actual figure being 6.4% rather than 16%.;Here's the verdict: Claim being evaluated: The claim being evaluated is that human-caused CO2 emissions are insignificant because they constitute a small fraction of the total CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, and that Europe contributes 16% of total human-caused CO2 emissions.

Claim Being Evaluated: Social media posts claim that human-made CO2, constituting only 0.0016% of the atmosphere’s total CO2 concentration (0.04%), has no significant influence on climate change, often supported by a graph showing human CO2 emissions as a tiny fraction. Additionally, the posts claim Europe contributes 16% of global human-caused CO2 emissions. 2. Verdict: False. 3. Explanation: The claim that human-made CO2 has no significant impact on climate change is false, as experts confirm that human activity has increased atmospheric CO2 from 180–280 ppm to 420–425 ppm, driving a 1.07°C temperature rise since 1850, per IPCC findings. The small percentage of CO2 in the atmosphere does not negate its significant warming effect. Additionally, the claim that Europe accounts for 16% of global human-caused CO2 emissions is incorrect; the EU’s share was 6.4% in 2023, according to the EU Commission’s Joint Research Centre."

Verdict: False. 3. Justification:  The videos are deepfakes, artificially generated using AI to imitate real people, including Lars Wallentin, Mikael Sandström, and SVT news anchors.  Both doctors have publicly denied involvement and condemned the videos.

The videos are part of a scam promoting fake supplements, with no scientific basis.  Facebook has removed related ads and blocked some accounts spreading these videos due to rule violations.;Deepfake Hoax: Murdered Swedish Doctors and Miracle Cures for Ailments are False Scam;Multiple deepfake videos, exploiting the likenesses of real Swedish medical professionals Lars Wallentin and Mikael Sandström, are spreading false medical claims and promoting scam miracle cures for conditions like cardiovascular disease and joint pain. These videos, which feature AI-generated news anchors and doctors making demonstrably false statements about health and medical treatments, are a complete fabrication and a scam.;1. What is the claim being evaluated? The core claim being evaluated is that Swedish medical professionals Lars Wallentin and Mikael Sandström were murdered or attacked by the pharmaceutical mafia for revealing shocking information or miracle cures for various health conditions (like cardiovascular disease, headaches, fatigue, swelling, varicose veins, arthritis, osteoarthritis, and joint pain), and that these cures are effective. 2.

Medical Professional Testimony: Doctors consulted by the Source Criticism Agency explicitly refute the medical claims made in the videos. Jakob Johansson, chief physician at Aleris, states that taking a tablet to clear the vessels is physiologically a very stupid idea and that there is no single 'magic bullet' that solves everything, in this way. He also refutes the claims that everyone will suffer from stroke or heart attack, or that blood vessels are always damaged by age 50.  Scam Promotion: The videos are designed to promote miracle cures (e.g., Frank & Frey CBD Capsules or a new unique cream formula) which are explicitly identified as a scam. The presence of these product promotions, often linked to fake news sites, further confirms the fraudulent nature of the videos.

Lars Wallentin himself has commented on a previous hoax video, stating it's total fake, completely out of touch with reality. Doctors consulted by Källkritikbyrån, including Jakob Johansson, chief physician at Aleris, state that the claims about cardiovascular diseases and the miracle pill are false and physiologically implausible.

These hoax videos, promoting fake miracle cures for cardiovascular diseases and joint pain, are scams exploiting the identities of real individuals to deceive viewers. The claims about the remedies are baseless and physiologically implausible, as confirmed by medical experts.;1. Claim Being Evaluated: The claim being evaluated is that AI-generated deepfake videos on Facebook allege that Swedish cardiologist Lars Wallentin was murdered in his car and that TV doctor Mikael Sandström’s apartment was burned down by a pharmaceutical mafia, with both individuals supposedly promoting miracle cures (a pill to clear blood vessels and a cream to relieve joint pain) that led to these alleged attacks. The videos also claim these remedies can prevent cardiovascular diseases and other health issues. 2. Verdict: False 3. Justification Based on Key Supporting Evidence: - Deepfake Fabrication: The Source Criticism Agency confirmed that the videos use AI to create deepfake versions of real individuals, including Lars Wallentin, Mikael Sandström, and SVT news anchor Lisbeth Åkerman, who have no connection to the events or claims depicted. The real Lars Wallentin commented that a previous hoax video about him was “total fake,” and the new video alleging his murder is similarly fabricated. - False Medical Claims: Medical expert Jakob Johansson, a chief physician at Aleris, stated that the claims about a pill clearing blood vessels or a cream instantly relieving joint inflammation are physiologically implausible. No such “magic bullet” exists for atherosclerosis or joint conditions, and the idea of a pill dislodging vessel plaques could dangerously cause clots, contradicting the video’s claims. - Scam Tactics: The videos direct viewers to fake websites, such as a fraudulent SVT page, to promote “Frank & Frey CBD Capsules” and other supposed remedies. These are identified as scams by the Source Criticism Agency, with no scientific basis for their efficacy. The account spreading the videos, posing as an American advertising agency, has been flagged for violating Meta’s rules, with 45 ads removed. - Victim Testimony: Mikael Sandström has previously told Aftonbladet about being exploited by scammers, confirming he has no involvement with the miracle cure claims. Similarly, Lars Wallentin has been contacted and is aware of the misuse of his identity, further debunking the videos’ narratives. - Misleading Prevalence Claims: The videos’ assertions that everyone will inevitably suffer from stroke, heart attack, or paralysis, and that blood vessels are universally damaged by age 50, are false. Johansson clarified that while atherosclerosis is common, it does not universally cause severe symptoms, and most people’s circulation is not significantly impacted by age 50.

The vascular tree is exposed to stress, but the majority of the population is not affected, especially not with an impact on circulation. What do you think about this kind of claim being spread like this?– As with all forms of quackery, it's sad because it can lead to people not taking the medical treatment and making the lifestyle changes that we know can reduce atherosclerosis. So it's sad if just one person goes through this, says Johansson.How the films are distributedThe video is still up on Facebook at the time of writing.

The assertion that everyone will be affected by stroke, heart attack, or paralysis, and that by age 50 blood vessels are already damaged, is also explicitly stated as No, not everyone is affected by it and No, of course that's not true.  Scam Behavior: The previous video linked to a fake SVT page promoting Frank & Frey CBD Capsules, presented as a dietary supplement that clears blood vessels, gives enormous strength, and perfect vision. The current video, while not having a direct link, promotes similar fantastical claims about vessel-clearing pills and joint-healing creams. This pattern aligns with known scam tactics.

Final Verdict: FALSE Evidence: The videos use AI-generated clones of the doctors and a news anchor, and both doctors have denied any involvement. The claims about the remedy's effectiveness in clearing blood vessels and curing cardiovascular diseases are debunked by medical experts, specifically Jakob Johansson, chief physician at Aleris, who calls the idea physiologically stupid and states that there is no single magic bullet for atherosclerosis.

Evidence Supporting the Verdict: - The videos use AI-generated deepfakes impersonating Lars Wallentin, Mikael Sandström, and SVT news anchor Lisbeth Åkerman, falsely depicting them in fabricated scenarios. The real Lars Wallentin confirmed the initial video about the Covid-19 vaccine was “total fake” and has been contacted by the Source Criticism Agency regarding the murder hoax. - Medical expert Jakob Johansson, chief physician at Aleris, debunked the health claims, stating that no pill can “clear blood vessels” as described, and such a mechanism would be physiologically implausible or dangerous. He also noted that atherosclerosis treatments exist but are not simple “magic bullets.” - The videos are distributed by fraudulent Facebook accounts, one claiming to be an American advertising agency, with links leading to fake SVT pages promoting “Frank & Frey CBD Capsules” or similar scams. The Source Criticism Agency identified these as scams, and Meta has removed related ads for violating rules. - Mikael Sandström has previously spoken to Aftonbladet about being targeted by similar scams, confirming he has no connection to the claims.

These AI-generated videos, impersonating real individuals and mimicking SVT news broadcasts, promote fake health products and are entirely fraudulent, according to the Source Criticism Agency and medical experts. The claims about miracle cures for cardiovascular diseases are baseless and dangerous, misleading viewers into avoiding legitimate treatments.;1. What is the claim? The claims involve two deepfake videos spreading false narratives: - The first video alleges that Lars Wallentin, a senior professor of cardiology in Uppsala, was murdered (shot in his car) after revealing a pill that clears blood vessels and prevents health issues like heart attacks, strokes, headaches, and varicose veins. It also claims the pharmaceutical industry, described as a “mafia,” was behind his death to silence him. - The second video claims that Mikael Sandström, a doctor and TV personality known as the “sun doctor,” had his apartment in Stockholm burned down by the pharmaceutical mafia to suppress his advocacy for a miracle cream that relieves inflammation and restores joints.

Deepfake videos allege that cardiologist Lars Wallentin was murdered after revealing a pill that can clear blood vessels and prevent serious health problems, while similar videos claim that doctor Mikael Sandström was targeted by pharmaceutical companies for promoting a miracle cure. 2. What is the final verdict? The claim is false. The videos are fabricated using AI deepfakes, the alleged murders never happened, and the health claims about miracle cures are baseless scams. 3. What reasoning supports this decision?  The real Lars Wallentin and Mikael Sandström have both denied involvement and condemned the videos.  Medical experts confirm that the supposed pill that “clears vessels” does not exist and the health claims are physiologically implausible.  The videos were created using AI-generated deepfakes and posted by accounts linked to fraudulent activities.  Facebook has removed some ads and blocked offending accounts, indicating a violation of platform rules.  The stories serve to promote fake remedies and mislead viewers, confirming the videos as scams.;Deepfake Doctors and News Anchors Promote Fake Cures: A Hoax Exposed;Sophisticated deepfake videos are circulating online, falsely claiming that prominent Swedish doctors Lars Wallentin and Mikael Sandström have made shocking health revelations or been victims of attacks by a pharmaceutical mafia. These videos, utilizing AI to impersonate news anchors and the doctors themselves, are a false scam designed to promote unproven and potentially dangerous miracle cures for various ailments, including atherosclerosis. The claims made in the videos, such as a pill that can clean the vessels or a cream that instantly relieves inflammation and completely restores joints, are medically unfounded and constitute a dangerous form of quackery.;"1. What is the claim? The claim is that deepfake videos featuring prominent Swedish doctors Lars Wallentin and Mikael Sandström, and a purported SVT news anchor Lisbeth Åkerman, are reporting on sensational news events (e.g., Wallentin's murder for revealing shocking information or Sandström's apartment being burned down by the pharmaceutical mafia) and promoting miracle cures for various health conditions, such as clearing blood vessels or curing joint pain. 2. What is the final verdict? False. 3. What reasoning supports this decision? The reasoning for this verdict is multi-faceted and thoroughly detailed in the provided fact-check:  Deepfake Technology: The videos are explicitly stated to be created using AI to generate deepfakes, making it appear as though real people are acting and speaking. The fact-check confirms that neither the news anchors nor the doctors in the videos are genuinely involved; they are real individuals whose likenesses have been digitally manipulated.  Direct Denials from Impersonated Individuals: Lars Wallentin himself commented on a previous hoax video, calling it Total fake, completely out of touch with reality. The Source Criticism Agency also confirmed contact with Wallentin after the murder video, further solidifying that he is alive and the claims are false. Mikael Sandström has also publicly stated he is contacted daily by elderly people scammed in his name and has expressed feeling desperate about the situation.  Medical Implausibility: Medical professionals consulted by Källkritikbyrån unequivocally state that the miracle cures promoted in the videos are physiologically unsound and impossible. For example, a pill to clear vessels is described as a very stupid idea that could cause dangerous clots, and there is no magic bullet for atherosclerosis. Claims of instant relief and complete regeneration are also dismissed as unrealistic.  Conspiracy Theories and Misinformation: The videos employ common scam tactics, such as promoting conspiracy theories about a pharmaceutical industry acting as a mafia to silence those with real cures. This is a common tactic to undermine trust in legitimate medicine and push unproven remedies.  Behavior of the Disseminating Accounts: The accounts sharing these videos have a history of violating platform rules, with numerous ads being taken down. This pattern is indicative of fraudulent activity.  Absence of Legitimate Information: While a previous video linked to a fake SVT page, the newer video promoting Wallentin's cure has no link, which is a red flag for scams that aim to sell products without providing verifiable information. In conclusion, the claims are fabricated using advanced AI technology to exploit the credibility of public figures and spread dangerous medical misinformation for financial gain.";No, Cardiologist Lars Wallentin Wasn't Murdered for Exposing Healthcare Secrets;Deepfake videos on Facebook falsely claim cardiologist Lars Wallentin was murdered after revealing healthcare secrets and promote a fake pill to clean blood vessels.

Similar claims were also made about another doctor, Mikael Sandström. Final Verdict: FALSE Reasoning: The claim is false because: The videos are created using AI-generated clones of real people (Lars Wallentin and Mikael Sandström) without their involvement or endorsement. The claims about the pill's effects on blood vessels are physiologically implausible and contradict established medical knowledge, according to doctors interviewed for the fact-check. There is no evidence to support the claim that Lars Wallentin was murdered or that he made any revelations about the Swedish healthcare system. The videos are part of a scam to promote fake remedies, and Facebook pages spreading these videos have been blocked from posting ads for violating Meta's rules.;Deepfake Videos Falsely Claiming Swedish Cardiologist’s Murder and Miracle Cures Debunked as Scams;A series of AI-generated deepfake videos on Facebook, falsely depicting Swedish cardiologist Lars Wallentin as murdered and promoting fake miracle cures alongside TV doctor Mikael Sandström, have been exposed as scams, with medical experts debunking the claims about vessel-clearing pills and creams as physiologically implausible.;Claim: AI-generated deepfake videos on Facebook allege that Swedish cardiologist Lars Wallentin was murdered after revealing shocking information about the Swedish healthcare system and promoting a pill that clears blood vessels, while another video claims TV doctor Mikael Sandström’s apartment was burned down by the pharmaceutical mafia for advocating a miracle cream for joint pain. Verdict: False. Reasoning: The videos are confirmed to be AI-generated deepfakes, misrepresenting real individuals like Lars Wallentin and Mikael Sandström, who have no connection to the claims made. Medical experts, such as Jakob Johansson from Aleris, have debunked the claims about vessel-clearing pills and miracle creams, stating they are physiologically implausible and lack scientific evidence. The videos are part of a scam promoting fake products like “Frank & Frey CBD Capsules,” spread through deceptive Facebook accounts, some of which have been blocked for violating Meta’s rules.
FC_09;Bullet point summary;False claim about the death of 14,000 infants in Gaza spread in media worldwide - including in Danish;14,000 infants in Gaza are at risk of dying from malnutrition within two days, UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher said on Tuesday. But the information is not correct, TjekDet's research shows, and the UN itself acknowledges that Tom Fletcher should have phrased it differently. However, the UN emphasizes that the situation in Gaza is critical and that thousands of children are at risk of dying from malnutrition over the next year;This is the fact-check:This was reported  in several media outlets  both at home  and abroad on Tuesday , and  politicians and  social media users are reporting the startling figure. The information about the 14,000 infants also found its way into the closing debate of the Folketing on Wednesday.The figure comes from the head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), Tom Fletcher, who appeared on  the BBC's Radio 4 Today programme on Tuesday morning , where he advocated for the need for UN trucks to be allowed to deliver emergency aid to Gaza.Let me explain what's on those trucks. It's baby food. Baby nutrition. 14,000 babies will die in the next 48 hours if we can't get to them, says Tom Fletcher on the BBC program.But it is not correct that 14,000 infants in Gaza are in acute danger of dying within 48 hours. Tom Fletcher's wording was unclear, explains Jens Lærke, spokesperson for OCHA, to TjekDet.“He should have said that 14,000 babies are very likely to suffer from severe acute malnutrition. This means that they are in danger of death and urgently need our help,” says Jens Lærke.Already on Tuesday, the BBC asked where Tom Fletcher got the startling figure.“We point to the urgent need to get supplies in to save the estimated 14,000 infants suffering from severe acute malnutrition in Gaza, as the IPC partnership has warned. We need to get the supplies in as quickly as possible, preferably within the next 48 hours,”  OCHA responded, according to the BBC .Jens Lærke confirms to TjekDet that the figure comes from the IPC, which assesses food security worldwide and with which the UN cooperates.  On May 12, the IPC issued a statement about acute food insecurity in Gaza.It states regarding emergency aid to Gaza that “immediate action is essential to prevent further deaths, hunger and acute malnutrition, and a move towards famine.”However, it does not say that 14,000 infants will die within two days.To TjekDet, the IPC explains that OCHA's interpretation is inaccurate. Instead, the IPC estimates that 14,100 children in Gaza under the age of five will be at risk of severe acute malnutrition. According to the IPC, this means that they risk dying from malnutrition within the next year if they do not receive treatment, but not within 48 hours, as Tom Fletcher said.Aid agencies have long reported widespread famine in Gaza. And although the UN now acknowledges that Tom Fletcher should have expressed himself differently, they emphasize that the situation in Gaza is critical and that thousands of children are at risk of dying from malnutrition over the next year.CheckDet has asked OCHA why Tom Fletcher sets 48 hours as the limit for emergency aid to arrive on time, when the IPC in their report mentions a period from April 2025 to March 2026. It is a  figure of speech , says Jens Lærke from OCHA.This is to emphasize that it has to be done quickly. We have been told by Israel that the current window for sending aid into Gaza is temporary. It is not necessarily 48 hours, because they have not set a time frame, but it is urgent, he says.Jens Lærke says that, to his knowledge, there is no official denial coming from the UN, but that it cannot be ruled out that one will come.

Main evidence: The actual figure of 14,000 comes from the IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification), which estimates that 14,100 children under five are at risk of severe acute malnutrition over the next year—not within 48 hours. Both IPC and OCHA have clarified that Fletcher’s statement was a misrepresentation of the data.  Verdict: False or misleading – The claim is inaccurate. While the situation in Gaza is critical and aid is urgently needed, no credible source supports the idea that 14,000 infants will die within two days. The reference to 48 hours was a rhetorical device to stress urgency, not a literal timeframe.;Here is the verdict of the fact-check based on the information provided: 1. What is the claim being verified? That 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within 48 hours if emergency aid is not delivered. 2. What is the final verdict? False. 3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict?  The figure of 14,000 originates from the IPC, which estimates that 14,100 children under five in Gaza are at risk of severe acute malnutrition—a condition that puts them at risk of death within the next year, not within 48 hours.  The UN’s OCHA spokesperson, Jens Lærke, clarified that Tom Fletcher's statement on the BBC was inaccurate and that the 48-hour time frame was a rhetorical expression of urgency, not a literal prediction.  The IPC explicitly stated that OCHA’s interpretation of their data was inaccurate, reinforcing that no official source supports the claim of 14,000 deaths in two days.;UN Official's Claim of 14,000 Gaza Infant Deaths in 48 Hours is False, Says OCHA and IPC;"Claim being verified: The claim, widely reported by media and politicians, was that 14,000 infants in Gaza were in acute danger of dying within 48 hours if emergency aid did not reach them. This figure originated from Tom Fletcher, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), during a BBC Radio 4 program.  Main evidence used: The fact-check relies on clarification from Jens Lærke, spokesperson for OCHA, and the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) partnership, the source of the original figure. OCHA clarified that Tom Fletcher's wording was unclear and he should have said that 14,000 babies are very likely to suffer from severe acute malnutrition. The IPC further explained that their estimate of 14,100 children under five at risk of severe acute malnutrition means they risk dying from malnutrition within the next year if untreated, not within 48 hours. The 48-hour timeframe was a figure of speech by Fletcher to emphasize urgency due to a temporary aid window.  Verdict and key reasons: The verdict is false regarding the 48-hour death threat for 14,000 infants. The key reasons are:  Tom Fletcher's statement was a miscommunication; the actual risk is severe acute malnutrition for 14,000 infants, not imminent death within 48 hours.  The IPC, the source of the data, confirms that these children are at risk of dying from malnutrition within the next year if they do not receive treatment, not within a two-day window.  The 48-hour timeframe mentioned by Fletcher was a rhetorical device to stress the urgency of aid delivery, not a literal deadline from the IPC report.";Here's the verdict of the fact-check: 1. What is the claim being verified? The claim being verified is that 14,000 infants in Gaza would die within the next 48 hours if emergency aid did not reach them. This statement was made by Tom Fletcher, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). 2. What is the final verdict? False. 3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict? The verdict is supported by clarifications from OCHA itself and the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), the source of the original figure.  OCHA's clarification: Jens Lærke, a spokesperson for OCHA, stated that Tom Fletcher's wording was unclear and that he should have said that 14,000 babies are very likely to suffer from severe acute malnutrition. Lærke also explained that the 48 hours was a figure of speech to emphasize the urgency of aid, not a strict deadline for immediate deaths.  IPC's explanation: The IPC, which assesses food security, confirmed that their estimate is that 14,100 children under the age of five in Gaza are at risk of severe acute malnutrition. However, they clarified that this risk means they could die from malnutrition within the next year if they do not receive treatment, not within 48 hours. Therefore, while the situation in Gaza remains critical and thousands of children are indeed at risk of severe malnutrition, the specific claim of 14,000 infants dying within 48 hours due to immediate lack of aid is not accurate.;UN Officer's Claim That 14,000 Infants Will Die in Gaza Within 48 Hours is False;Claim being verified: The claim that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within 48 hours if emergency aid doesn't arrive, as stated by Tom Fletcher, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), on the BBC's Radio 4 Today program. Main evidence: The main evidence used to refute this claim comes from the IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification) partnership, which OCHA cited as the source of the 14,000 figure. However, the IPC clarifies that their estimate is for 14,100 children under five years old being at risk of severe acute malnutrition over the next year, not within 48 hours. Verdict: The verdict is false. The key reason behind this verdict is that Tom Fletcher's wording was unclear and misleading. According to Jens Lærke, OCHA spokesperson, Tom Fletcher should have said that 14,000 babies are likely to suffer from severe acute malnutrition, putting them at risk of death if untreated, but not specifically within 48 hours.

OCHA's spokesperson, Jens Lærke, also confirms that Tom Fletcher's statement was unclear and should have specified the risk of malnutrition over a longer period, rather than implying immediate death within 48 hours.

Lærke clarified that Fletcher’s statement was inaccurate, and the correct figure is that 14,100 children under five in Gaza are at risk of severe acute malnutrition, potentially leading to death within a year if untreated, not 48 hours. The IPC’s May 12 statement highlights acute food insecurity in Gaza but does not specify 14,000 infants dying within two days. Lærke explained the 48-hour timeframe was a figure of speech to emphasize urgency, not a literal deadline. - Verdict: False. The claim that 14,000 infants will die within 48 hours is incorrect. The IPC estimates 14,100 children under five are at risk of severe acute malnutrition over a year, not two days. Fletcher’s statement was a misrepresentation, though the broader issue of critical malnutrition in Gaza remains urgent.;1. Claim being verified: The claim is that 14,000 infants in Gaza are in acute danger of dying within 48 hours if emergency aid, specifically baby food and nutrition, is not delivered, as stated by Tom Fletcher, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), on BBC Radio 4. 2. Final verdict: False. 3. Evidence or reasoning: The verdict is based on clarifications from Jens Lærke, OCHA spokesperson, and the IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification). Lærke stated that Fletcher’s claim was inaccurate, and the correct figure is that 14,100 children under five in Gaza are at risk of severe acute malnutrition, which could lead to death within a year if untreated, not within 48 hours. The IPC’s May 12 statement on acute food insecurity in Gaza does not support the 48-hour timeframe. Lærke noted the 48-hour deadline was a figure of speech to emphasize urgency, not a literal timeframe. Thus, the claim misrepresents the timeline and severity of the situation.

Evidence assessed: The figure of 14,000 infants comes from the IPC, which estimated that 14,100 children under five in Gaza are at risk of severe acute malnutrition over the next year—not within 48 hours. OCHA spokesperson Jens Lærke clarified that Fletcher’s wording was misleading and that the 48-hour reference was a rhetorical way to stress urgency, not a literal timeframe.  Verdict: The claim is inaccurate. While the humanitarian situation in Gaza is indeed critical, the assertion that 14,000 babies could die within 48 hours is incorrect. The correct interpretation is that 14,100 children are at risk over the next year if aid is not provided.;Verdict: False 1. Claim being evaluated: Tom Fletcher, a UN OCHA official, claimed on BBC Radio 4 that 14,000 babies in Gaza would die within 48 hours if aid was not delivered immediately. 2. Evidence reviewed:  The figure of 14,000 originates from the IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification), which estimates that 14,100 children under five in Gaza are at risk of severe acute malnutrition.  The IPC projection refers to a timeframe from April 2025 to March 2026, not an imminent 48-hour period.  OCHA spokesperson Jens Lærke acknowledged that Fletcher's wording was misleading, explaining that the 48 hours was rhetorical and meant to emphasize urgency, not literal timing. 3. Justification:  The claim that 14,000 babies could die within 48 hours is not supported by the IPC data or any other official source.  The correct interpretation is that 14,100 children are at long-term risk if they do not receive treatment, not that they face immediate death within two days.  OCHA has admitted the misstatement and clarified the context of the urgency. Therefore, the claim is false.;UN Clarifies 14,000 Babies Dying Claim in Gaza: Critical Malnutrition Risk, Not 48-Hour Death Toll; Claim Evaluated: The fact-check investigates the claim made by Tom Fletcher, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), on BBC Radio 4, stating that 14,000 babies will die in the next 48 hours if we can't get to them in Gaza due to lack of emergency aid.  Evidence: OCHA spokesperson Jens Lærke clarified that Fletcher's wording was unclear. The figure of 14,000 babies actually refers to an IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification) estimate of 14,100 children under the age of five who are very likely to suffer from severe acute malnutrition. The IPC confirmed its assessment means these children risk dying from malnutrition within the next year if untreated, not within 48 hours. The 48 hours timeframe was a figure of speech used by Fletcher to emphasize urgency.  Verdict: The claim that 14,000 infants in Gaza are in acute danger of dying within 48 hours is incorrect. While the situation in Gaza is critical and thousands of children are at risk of severe acute malnutrition and potential death over the next year, Tom Fletcher's statement misrepresented the immediacy and scope of the IPC's findings.;Verdict: Mixed Justification: The claim made by Tom Fletcher that 14,000 babies will die in the next 48 hours if we can't get to them in Gaza is False in its precise wording regarding the timeframe. However, the underlying premise of extreme danger to a significant number of infants due to malnutrition is True.  False Aspect: The 48-hour timeframe for immediate deaths of 14,000 infants is incorrect. OCHA, through its spokesperson Jens Lærke, clarified that Fletcher's statement was a figure of speech to emphasize urgency, not a literal timeline. The IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification), the source of the 14,000 figure, estimates that 14,100 children under five are at risk of severe acute malnutrition and could die from it within the next year if they do not receive treatment.  True Aspect: The fact-check confirms that there is indeed a critical situation in Gaza, with the IPC reporting 14,100 children under five at risk of severe acute malnutrition. This condition is life-threatening and requires urgent intervention to prevent deaths over a longer period. Aid agencies have consistently reported widespread famine and the severe risk of malnutrition-related deaths among children in Gaza. The UN acknowledges the critical situation and the risk of thousands of children dying from malnutrition over the next year. Therefore, while the specific 48-hour timeline was a misstatement, the broader message of a large number of infants facing a grave and potentially fatal threat from malnutrition due to aid shortages is accurate.;UN Official's Claim That 14,000 Babies Will Die in Gaza Within 48 Hours is False;Claim: Tom Fletcher, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), claimed that 14,000 babies in Gaza would die within 48 hours if emergency aid didn't reach them. Evidence: The IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification) partnership had warned about 14,100 children under five years old being at risk of severe acute malnutrition in Gaza. However, the IPC report didn't mention a 48-hour timeframe for deaths, instead stating these children would be at risk over the next year if untreated. OCHA's spokesperson, Jens Lærke, explained that Tom Fletcher's wording was unclear and should have specified that these babies are at risk of severe acute malnutrition and death if untreated. Verdict: The claim is incorrect. Tom Fletcher's statement was misleading, and OCHA acknowledges that the situation in Gaza is critical, with thousands of children at risk of dying from malnutrition over the next year, not within 48 hours. The 48-hour mention was a figure of speech to emphasize urgency due to a temporary window for sending aid into Gaza ¹.;Verdict: False The claim being evaluated is that 14,000 babies in Gaza will die within 48 hours if emergency aid doesn't reach them, as stated by Tom Fletcher, head of OCHA. However, the evidence provided shows that: The IPC report estimates 14,100 children under five years old are at risk of severe acute malnutrition, but doesn't specify a 48-hour timeframe for deaths. Instead, it mentions a risk of death within the next year if untreated. OCHA's spokesperson, Jens Lærke, confirms that Tom Fletcher's wording was unclear and should have specified the risk of severe acute malnutrition and death over a longer period. The 48-hour mention was a figure of speech to emphasize urgency, not a literal timeframe for potential deaths. Given these facts, the claim that 14,000 babies will die within 48 hours is false. The actual risk is severe acute malnutrition and potential death over a longer period (up to a year) if untreated, highlighting the need for urgent aid but not within a specific 48-hour window.;UN Official’s Claim of 14,000 Infants Dying in Gaza Within 48 Hours Proven False;Claim Evaluated: Tom Fletcher, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), stated on BBC Radio 4 that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within 48 hours if emergency aid, specifically baby food and nutrition, is not delivered. This claim was widely reported by media and discussed by politicians and social media users. - Main Evidence: The figure of 14,000 infants comes from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), which OCHA collaborates with. The IPC clarified that 14,100 children under five in Gaza are at risk of severe acute malnutrition, facing potential death within a year if untreated, not within 48 hours as Fletcher claimed. OCHA's spokesperson, Jens Lærke, acknowledged Fletcher's statement was unclear and should have indicated the risk of severe malnutrition, not immediate death. The 48-hour timeframe was described as a figure of speech to emphasize urgency, not a literal deadline, as no specific timeframe was set by Israel for aid delivery. - Verdict: The claim that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within 48 hours without aid is inaccurate. The IPC's projection refers to 14,100 children under five at risk of severe acute malnutrition over a year, not imminent death within two days. OCHA corrected Fletcher’s misstatement, emphasizing the critical but less immediate nature of the crisis, with thousands of children at risk of malnutrition-related death over the next year if aid is not provided.;Verdict: The claim is false. Claim Evaluated: Tom Fletcher, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), stated on BBC Radio 4 that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within 48 hours if emergency aid, specifically baby food and nutrition, is not delivered. Key Evidence: - The figure of 14,000 infants originates from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), which estimates that 14,100 children under five in Gaza are at risk of severe acute malnutrition, potentially leading to death within a year if untreated, not within 48 hours as claimed. - OCHA spokesperson Jens Lærke clarified that Fletcher’s statement was misleading, as it should have indicated that 14,000 infants are at risk of severe acute malnutrition, not immediate death within 48 hours. - The 48-hour timeframe was described as a figure of speech to emphasize urgency, not a literal deadline, as no specific timeframe was set by Israel for aid delivery. - The IPC explicitly stated that OCHA’s interpretation was “inaccurate,” confirming the risk extends over a year, not two days. Justification: The claim is false because it inaccurately states that 14,000 infants will die within 48 hours without aid, whereas the IPC’s data indicates a longer-term risk of severe acute malnutrition for 14,100 children under five over a year. The 48-hour timeframe exaggerates the immediacy of the crisis, and OCHA’s correction confirms the misstatement. While the situation in Gaza is critical, the specific claim about imminent deaths within two days is not supported by the evidence.
FC_09;Bullet point summary;False claim about the death of 14,000 infants in Gaza spread in media worldwide - including in Danish;14,000 infants in Gaza are at risk of dying from malnutrition within two days, UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher said on Tuesday. But the information is not correct, TjekDet's research shows, and the UN itself acknowledges that Tom Fletcher should have phrased it differently. However, the UN emphasizes that the situation in Gaza is critical and that thousands of children are at risk of dying from malnutrition over the next year;This is the fact-check:This was reported  in several media outlets  both at home  and abroad on Tuesday , and  politicians and  social media users are reporting the startling figure. The information about the 14,000 infants also found its way into the closing debate of the Folketing on Wednesday.The figure comes from the head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), Tom Fletcher, who appeared on  the BBC's Radio 4 Today programme on Tuesday morning , where he advocated for the need for UN trucks to be allowed to deliver emergency aid to Gaza.Let me explain what's on those trucks. It's baby food. Baby nutrition. 14,000 babies will die in the next 48 hours if we can't get to them, says Tom Fletcher on the BBC program.But it is not correct that 14,000 infants in Gaza are in acute danger of dying within 48 hours. Tom Fletcher's wording was unclear, explains Jens Lærke, spokesperson for OCHA, to TjekDet.“He should have said that 14,000 babies are very likely to suffer from severe acute malnutrition. This means that they are in danger of death and urgently need our help,” says Jens Lærke.Already on Tuesday, the BBC asked where Tom Fletcher got the startling figure.“We point to the urgent need to get supplies in to save the estimated 14,000 infants suffering from severe acute malnutrition in Gaza, as the IPC partnership has warned. We need to get the supplies in as quickly as possible, preferably within the next 48 hours,”  OCHA responded, according to the BBC .Jens Lærke confirms to TjekDet that the figure comes from the IPC, which assesses food security worldwide and with which the UN cooperates.  On May 12, the IPC issued a statement about acute food insecurity in Gaza.It states regarding emergency aid to Gaza that “immediate action is essential to prevent further deaths, hunger and acute malnutrition, and a move towards famine.”However, it does not say that 14,000 infants will die within two days.To TjekDet, the IPC explains that OCHA's interpretation is inaccurate. Instead, the IPC estimates that 14,100 children in Gaza under the age of five will be at risk of severe acute malnutrition. According to the IPC, this means that they risk dying from malnutrition within the next year if they do not receive treatment, but not within 48 hours, as Tom Fletcher said.Aid agencies have long reported widespread famine in Gaza. And although the UN now acknowledges that Tom Fletcher should have expressed himself differently, they emphasize that the situation in Gaza is critical and that thousands of children are at risk of dying from malnutrition over the next year.CheckDet has asked OCHA why Tom Fletcher sets 48 hours as the limit for emergency aid to arrive on time, when the IPC in their report mentions a period from April 2025 to March 2026. It is a  figure of speech , says Jens Lærke from OCHA.This is to emphasize that it has to be done quickly. We have been told by Israel that the current window for sending aid into Gaza is temporary. It is not necessarily 48 hours, because they have not set a time frame, but it is urgent, he says.Jens Lærke says that, to his knowledge, there is no official denial coming from the UN, but that it cannot be ruled out that one will come. He adds that OCHA has explained itself to many media outlets and in doing so has attempted to correct Tom Fletcher's statement.On Tuesday, a number of Danish media outlets published an article from Ritzau claiming that 14,000 infants in Gaza could die within two days.On Wednesday morning, Ritzau published a new article stating that the IPC's projection concerns children under five years of age, and that it concerns a period of one year and not two days.;Contextual;Claim That 14,000 Infants in Gaza Will Die Within 48 Hours Is False, Says UN and IPC; The Claim: Tom Fletcher from the UN OCHA stated on BBC Radio 4 that 14,000 babies in Gaza will die within 48 hours if emergency aid is not delivered, a claim that was widely reported by media and echoed by politicians and social media users.  The Evidence: The figure of 14,000 comes from the IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification), which estimates that 14,100 children under five in Gaza are at risk of severe acute malnutrition over the coming year (April 2025 to March 2026) — not within 48 hours. UN spokesperson Jens Lærke clarified that Fletcher’s statement was a misrepresentation meant to stress urgency, not a literal prediction.  The Verdict: The claim is inaccurate. The 14,000 figure refers to children at risk over the next year, not imminently. UN OCHA acknowledged Fletcher's statement was misleading and has attempted to correct it in the media, while still emphasizing the urgency of aid delivery.;1. What is the claim being assessed? The claim being assessed is that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within 48 hours if emergency aid is not delivered, as stated by Tom Fletcher from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) during a BBC Radio 4 interview. 2. What is the verdict? False. 3. What reasoning or evidence supports this decision? The claim is false because the figure of 14,000 refers to the estimated number of children under five in Gaza at risk of severe acute malnutrition over the course of a year (from April 2025 to March 2026), according to data from the IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification), not within 48 hours. Tom Fletcher's statement was acknowledged by the UN as a miscommunication or figure of speech meant to emphasize urgency, not an accurate reflection of the timeframe. The IPC itself stated that OCHA’s interpretation was “inaccurate,” and while the humanitarian situation in Gaza is critical, the claim that 14,000 babies will die in two days is not supported by evidence.;Claim of 14,000 Gaza Infants Dying in 48 Hours is False;The Claim: Tom Fletcher, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), stated on BBC's Radio 4 Today programme that 14,000 infants in Gaza would die within 48 hours if emergency aid didn't reach them.  The Evidence: OCHA spokesperson Jens Lærke clarified that Fletcher's wording was unclear. The figure of 14,000 comes from the IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification), which estimates that 14,100 children under five in Gaza are at risk of severe acute malnutrition and could die from it within the next year if untreated, not within 48 hours. OCHA explained that the 48 hours was a figure of speech to emphasize urgency, related to a temporary window for aid delivery mentioned by Israel.  The Verdict: The claim that 14,000 infants would die within 48 hours is false. While the underlying data points to a severe risk of death from malnutrition for 14,100 children over a year, Tom Fletcher's specific timeframe was inaccurate, as confirmed by OCHA and the IPC. The situation in Gaza regarding child malnutrition is critically urgent, but the immediate 48-hour deadline for widespread infant deaths as stated was a misrepresentation.;Here's the final verdict based on the fact-check: 1. The Claim Being Assessed: The claim is that 14,000 infants in Gaza would die within the next 48 hours if emergency aid did not reach them. This statement was made by Tom Fletcher, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), on the BBC's Radio 4 Today programme. 2. The Verdict: False. 3. Reasoning/Evidence: The claim is false because Tom Fletcher's wording was inaccurate. Jens Lærke, a spokesperson for OCHA, clarified that Fletcher should have said that 14,000 babies are very likely to suffer from severe acute malnutrition, which means they are in danger of death and urgently need help, but not necessarily within a 48-hour timeframe. The figure of 14,000 (specifically 14,100) children under five comes from the IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification), a body with which the UN cooperates to assess food security. The IPC estimates that these children are at risk of dying from malnutrition within the next year if they do not receive treatment, not within 48 hours. OCHA further explained that Tom Fletcher's reference to 48 hours was a figure of speech intended to emphasize the urgency of the situation, particularly given a temporary window for aid delivery that Israel had indicated. Ritzau, a Danish news agency, initially reported the claim but later issued a correction to reflect the IPC's projection of a one-year timeframe.;UN Official's Claim That 14,000 Infants Will Die in Gaza Within 48 Hours: Fact-Checked as FALSE;The claim being assessed is that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within 48 hours if emergency aid doesn't reach them, as stated by Tom Fletcher, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), on the BBC's Radio 4 Today program. The Evidence: The main evidence provided to evaluate the claim comes from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) partnership, which estimates that 14,100 children under the age of five in Gaza are at risk of severe acute malnutrition. However, the IPC clarifies that this doesn't mean they will die within 48 hours, but rather within the next year if they don't receive treatment. OCHA's interpretation of the IPC's report was deemed inaccurate by the IPC. The Verdict: The claim is false. According to the evidence, Tom Fletcher's wording was unclear, and he should have said that 14,000 babies are likely to suffer from severe acute malnutrition, putting them at risk of death if they don't receive help. The 48-hour timeframe mentioned by Fletcher was a figure of speech to emphasize urgency, not a literal deadline ¹.;Based on the fact-check, here's the final verdict: The Claim: The claim being assessed is that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within 48 hours if emergency aid doesn't reach them, as stated by Tom Fletcher, head of OCHA, on the BBC's Radio 4 Today program. The Verdict: False Reasoning/Evidence: The IPC partnership estimates that 14,100 children under the age of five in Gaza are at risk of severe acute malnutrition, but this doesn't mean they will die within 48 hours. Instead, the IPC warns that these children are at risk of dying from malnutrition within the next year if they don't receive treatment. OCHA's Jens Lærke acknowledges that Tom Fletcher's wording was unclear and that the 48-hour timeframe was a figure of speech to emphasize urgency, rather than a literal deadline. This discrepancy between the claim and the evidence provided by the IPC supports the verdict that the claim is false.;UN Official’s Claim of 14,000 Gaza Infants Dying in 48 Hours Without Aid Is False, Misrepresents Year-Long Malnutrition Risk;The claim: Tom Fletcher, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), stated on BBC Radio 4 that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within 48 hours if emergency aid, specifically baby food and nutrition, is not delivered. - The evidence: The figure of 14,000 infants comes from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), which estimates that 14,100 children under five in Gaza are at risk of severe acute malnutrition and could die within a year without treatment, not within 48 hours.

OCHA clarified Fletcher’s wording was incorrect and should have referred to 14,000 infants at risk of severe acute malnutrition, not imminent death.  The IPC, the source of the figure, confirmed the risk refers to children under five potentially dying from malnutrition over the next year, not within 48 hours.  OCHA explained Fletcher used 48 hours as a figure of speech to stress urgency, not as a literal deadline.  Media outlets later corrected their reporting to reflect the actual IPC assessment. 3. Claim: 14,000 infants in Gaza are at risk of dying within 48 hours if aid doesn't arrive. ---  Summary: The claim that 14,000 infants in Gaza are at risk of dying within 48 hours if emergency aid does not arrive is false. The figure originated from Tom Fletcher, head of the UN OCHA, during a BBC interview. However, his statement was misleading. The actual source of the number is the IPC, which estimates that 14,100 children under five in Gaza are at risk of severe acute malnutrition—a condition that could result in death within the next year if left untreated, not within 48 hours. OCHA later clarified that Fletcher's use of 48 hours was a rhetorical device to emphasize urgency, not a literal timeframe. Although the humanitarian situation remains dire, the specific claim of mass infant deaths within two days is not supported by the evidence.;1. What is the claim being evaluated? The claim is that 14,000 infants in Gaza are at risk of dying within 48 hours if emergency aid does not arrive. 2. Based on the evidence provided, is the claim true, false, mixed or another verdict category? The claim is false. 3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict? The figure of 14,000 infants comes from the IPC’s assessment of children under five at risk of severe acute malnutrition, which could lead to death within a year, not within 48 hours. Tom Fletcher’s original statement on the 48-hour timeframe was a misinterpretation and a figure of speech to stress urgency, not a literal prediction. OCHA and IPC clarified this, and media outlets corrected earlier inaccurate reports. ---  Final Verdict: The claim that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within 48 hours without emergency aid is false. The actual data indicate that about 14,000 children under five are at risk of severe acute malnutrition, which may result in death over the course of the next year if untreated. The 48-hour timeframe was a rhetorical exaggeration rather than a factual prediction.;Gaza 14,000 Babies Dying in 48 Hours Claim Misleading, But Malnutrition Crisis for Children Remains Severe;1. Verdict: Mixed. The claim of 14,000 infants being in acute danger of dying within 48 hours is false, but the underlying concern about severe malnutrition among a large number of children in Gaza is true. 2. Evidence:  Tom Fletcher of OCHA stated on BBC Radio 4 that 14,000 babies will die in the next 48 hours if we can't get to them.  Jens Lærke, OCHA spokesperson, clarified that Fletcher should have said that 14,000 babies are very likely to suffer from severe acute malnutrition, meaning they are in danger of death and need urgent help, but not within 48 hours.  OCHA, according to the BBC, stated the figure refers to 14,000 infants suffering from severe acute malnutrition in Gaza, as the IPC partnership has warned.  The IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification) confirmed to TjekDet that their estimate is 14,100 children under five at risk of severe acute malnutrition, meaning they risk dying from malnutrition within the next year if untreated, not within 48 hours.  Jens Lærke explained that the 48 hours was a figure of speech to emphasize urgency due to a temporary window for aid delivery, not a literal deadline.  Ritzau, a Danish news agency, initially reported the 48-hour claim but later corrected it to reflect the IPC's one-year timeframe for children under five. 3. Claim: The main claim being fact-checked is that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within the next 48 hours if emergency aid does not reach them. Cohesive Summary: The claim that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within the next 48 hours is false. This startling figure was reported by Tom Fletcher, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), on a BBC program. However, OCHA spokesperson Jens Lærke clarified that Fletcher's wording was inaccurate. The correct information, derived from the IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification) partnership, is that an estimated 14,100 children under the age of five are at risk of severe acute malnutrition. While this condition does put them in danger of death, the IPC's assessment indicates this risk is over the next year if they do not receive treatment, not within 48 hours. OCHA explained that the 48 hours was a rhetorical device to emphasize the extreme urgency of aid delivery, given a temporary window for access. Therefore, while the immediate and specific claim of death within 48 hours is incorrect, the underlying crisis of severe acute malnutrition affecting thousands of children in Gaza, and the urgent need for aid, is indeed true.;1. What is the claim being evaluated? The claim being evaluated is that 14,000 infants in Gaza are in acute danger of dying within 48 hours. 2. Based on the evidence provided, is the claim true, false, mixed or another verdict category? Mixed. 3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict? The claim originated from Tom Fletcher of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) who stated on BBC Radio 4 that 14,000 babies will die in the next 48 hours if we can't get to them. However, OCHA spokesperson Jens Lærke later clarified that Fletcher's wording was unclear. The correct statement should have been that 14,000 babies are very likely to suffer from severe acute malnutrition and are in danger of death, but not within a 48-hour timeframe. The figure comes from the IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification), which estimates that 14,100 children under five in Gaza are at risk of severe acute malnutrition and could die from it within the next year if they do not receive treatment. The 48 hours was a figure of speech used by Fletcher to emphasize urgency, not a literal deadline. While the specific timeline of 48 hours is false, the underlying crisis of severe acute malnutrition affecting thousands of children and putting them at risk of death over a longer period is accurate. Final Verdict: The claim is mixed. While a UN official incorrectly stated that 14,000 infants in Gaza would die within 48 hours, the actual situation, based on data from the IPC, is that approximately 14,100 children under the age of five are at risk of severe acute malnutrition and face a risk of death from it within the next year if they do not receive treatment. The 48 hours was an emphatic, rather than literal, timeframe.;Claim That 14,000 Infants in Gaza Will Die Within 48 Hours Without Aid Is False;Verdict: False. The claim that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within 48 hours is not supported by evidence. Evidence: Key pieces of evidence include statements from the IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification) and OCHA (UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs). The IPC estimates 14,100 children under five are at risk of severe acute malnutrition over the next year, not within 48 hours. OCHA's spokesperson, Jens Lærke, confirms the figure comes from the IPC but was misinterpreted by Tom Fletcher. Claim: The main claim is that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within 48 hours if emergency aid doesn't arrive, as stated by Tom Fletcher on the BBC's Radio 4 Today programme. Here's a cohesive summary: The claim that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within 48 hours without emergency aid is false. According to the fact-check, Tom Fletcher's statement on the BBC was based on IPC data but was misinterpreted. The IPC actually estimates that 14,100 children under five are at risk of severe acute malnutrition over the next year, not within 48 hours. OCHA's spokesperson confirmed the misinterpretation, and the IPC described OCHA's interpretation as inaccurate. The evidence shows that while the situation in Gaza is critical, the claim about 14,000 infants dying within 48 hours is not supported.;Here are the answers: What is the claim being evaluated?

The IPC describing OCHA's interpretation of their data as inaccurate when it comes to the timeframe. Final Verdict: The claim that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within 48 hours if emergency aid doesn't arrive is FALSE. The evidence shows that while thousands of children are at risk of severe acute malnutrition, the specific timeframe and number of infants at risk of death within 48 hours were misrepresented.

Evidence: - Tom Fletcher, head of OCHA, stated on BBC Radio 4 that 14,000 babies will die in the next 48 hours if aid does not reach Gaza, which was widely reported. - Jens Lærke, OCHA spokesperson, clarified to TjekDet that Fletcher's statement was inaccurate; he meant 14,000 babies are at risk of severe acute malnutrition, which could lead to death without urgent aid, but not within 48 hours. - The IPC, which assesses food security, estimates 14,100 children under five in Gaza are at risk of severe acute malnutrition over the next year (April 2025 to March 2026), not within 48 hours. - The IPC called OCHA's interpretation inaccurate regarding the 48-hour timeframe. - Lærke explained the 48-hour reference was a figure of speech to emphasize urgency, not a literal deadline. 3. Claim: The claim is that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within 48 hours if emergency aid is not delivered. Summary: The fact-check investigates the claim that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within 48 hours without emergency aid, as stated by Tom Fletcher, head of OCHA, on BBC Radio 4. This claim was widely reported by media outlets and discussed in political forums. However, the evidence shows the claim is false. Jens Lærke, an OCHA spokesperson, clarified to TjekDet that Fletcher's statement was misleading; he intended to highlight that 14,000 babies are at risk of severe acute malnutrition, which could lead to death without urgent aid, but not specifically within 48 hours. The IPC, a key source for the figure, estimates that 14,100 children under five in Gaza face this risk over the next year (April 2025 to March 2026), not within two days, and labeled OCHA's 48-hour interpretation as inaccurate. Lærke noted the 48-hour timeframe was a rhetorical device to stress urgency, not a literal deadline. Thus, the claim is false because it inaccurately suggests an imminent 48-hour deadline for the deaths of 14,000 infants, whereas the actual risk is severe malnutrition over a longer period.";1. What is the claim being evaluated? The claim is that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within 48 hours if emergency aid is not delivered, as stated by Tom Fletcher, head of OCHA, on BBC Radio 4. 2. Based on the evidence provided, is the claim true, false, mixed, or another verdict category? The claim is false. 3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict? The evidence shows that Tom Fletcher's statement was inaccurate. Jens Lærke, OCHA spokesperson, clarified to TjekDet that Fletcher meant 14,000 babies are at risk of severe acute malnutrition, which could lead to death without urgent aid, but not specifically within 48 hours. The IPC, the source of the figure, estimates that 14,100 children under five in Gaza are at risk of severe acute malnutrition over the next year (April 2025 to March 2026), not within 48 hours, and called OCHA's 48-hour interpretation inaccurate. Lærke explained the 48-hour timeframe was a rhetorical device to emphasize urgency, not a literal deadline. Final Verdict: The claim that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within 48 hours without emergency aid is false. Evidence from OCHA and the IPC confirms that the figure refers to 14,100 children under five at risk of severe acute malnutrition over a year, not imminent death within 48 hours. The 48-hour timeframe was a rhetorical exaggeration, not supported by the IPC's data, leading to the false verdict.
FC_09;Bullet point summary;False claim about the death of 14,000 infants in Gaza spread in media worldwide - including in Danish;14,000 infants in Gaza are at risk of dying from malnutrition within two days, UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher said on Tuesday. But the information is not correct, TjekDet's research shows, and the UN itself acknowledges that Tom Fletcher should have phrased it differently. However, the UN emphasizes that the situation in Gaza is critical and that thousands of children are at risk of dying from malnutrition over the next year;This is the fact-check:This was reported  in several media outlets  both at home  and abroad on Tuesday , and  politicians and  social media users are reporting the startling figure. The information about the 14,000 infants also found its way into the closing debate of the Folketing on Wednesday.The figure comes from the head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), Tom Fletcher, who appeared on  the BBC's Radio 4 Today programme on Tuesday morning , where he advocated for the need for UN trucks to be allowed to deliver emergency aid to Gaza.Let me explain what's on those trucks. It's baby food. Baby nutrition. 14,000 babies will die in the next 48 hours if we can't get to them, says Tom Fletcher on the BBC program.But it is not correct that 14,000 infants in Gaza are in acute danger of dying within 48 hours. Tom Fletcher's wording was unclear, explains Jens Lærke, spokesperson for OCHA, to TjekDet.“He should have said that 14,000 babies are very likely to suffer from severe acute malnutrition. This means that they are in danger of death and urgently need our help,” says Jens Lærke.Already on Tuesday, the BBC asked where Tom Fletcher got the startling figure.“We point to the urgent need to get supplies in to save the estimated 14,000 infants suffering from severe acute malnutrition in Gaza, as the IPC partnership has warned. We need to get the supplies in as quickly as possible, preferably within the next 48 hours,”  OCHA responded, according to the BBC .Jens Lærke confirms to TjekDet that the figure comes from the IPC, which assesses food security worldwide and with which the UN cooperates.  On May 12, the IPC issued a statement about acute food insecurity in Gaza.It states regarding emergency aid to Gaza that “immediate action is essential to prevent further deaths, hunger and acute malnutrition, and a move towards famine.”However, it does not say that 14,000 infants will die within two days.To TjekDet, the IPC explains that OCHA's interpretation is inaccurate. Instead, the IPC estimates that 14,100 children in Gaza under the age of five will be at risk of severe acute malnutrition. According to the IPC, this means that they risk dying from malnutrition within the next year if they do not receive treatment, but not within 48 hours, as Tom Fletcher said.Aid agencies have long reported widespread famine in Gaza. And although the UN now acknowledges that Tom Fletcher should have expressed himself differently, they emphasize that the situation in Gaza is critical and that thousands of children are at risk of dying from malnutrition over the next year.CheckDet has asked OCHA why Tom Fletcher sets 48 hours as the limit for emergency aid to arrive on time, when the IPC in their report mentions a period from April 2025 to March 2026. It is a  figure of speech , says Jens Lærke from OCHA.This is to emphasize that it has to be done quickly. We have been told by Israel that the current window for sending aid into Gaza is temporary. It is not necessarily 48 hours, because they have not set a time frame, but it is urgent, he says.Jens Lærke says that, to his knowledge, there is no official denial coming from the UN, but that it cannot be ruled out that one will come. He adds that OCHA has explained itself to many media outlets and in doing so has attempted to correct Tom Fletcher's statement.On Tuesday, a number of Danish media outlets published an article from Ritzau claiming that 14,000 infants in Gaza could die within two days.On Wednesday morning, Ritzau published a new article stating that the IPC's projection concerns children under five years of age, and that it concerns a period of one year and not two days.;Role;Claim that 14,000 Infants in Gaza Will Die Within 48 Hours Without Aid Is False;"Claim: The claim evaluated is that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within 48 hours if emergency aid is not delivered. Evidence:  Tom Fletcher, head of the UN OCHA, stated on BBC Radio 4 that 14,000 babies would die in 48 hours without aid.  OCHA later clarified Fletcher’s wording was misleading; the figure refers to infants at risk of severe acute malnutrition who urgently need help, not guaranteed deaths within two days.  The figure originates from the IPC, which estimates about 14,100 children under five in Gaza are at risk of severe malnutrition that could lead to death within the next year if untreated—not within 48 hours.  The IPC’s report covers a one-year period (April 2025 to March 2026), not an immediate two-day window.  OCHA emphasized urgency but explained the 48-hour timeframe was figurative, reflecting limited aid delivery windows rather than a strict deadline for survival.  Media initially reported the claim as imminent deaths but later corrected their coverage to align with IPC’s assessment. Verdict: The claim that 14,000 infants will die within 48 hours without aid is false. The number reflects those at risk of severe malnutrition with potential death over a year if untreated, not an immediate fatality count. The original statement was a miscommunication, and the situation, while critical, does not imply such an immediate death toll.";1. Claim being assessed: That 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within 48 hours if emergency aid is not delivered. 2. Final verdict: False. 3. Explanation: The evidence shows that the figure of 14,000 refers to infants at risk of severe acute malnutrition who could die within a year without treatment, not within 48 hours. This number comes from the IPC’s food security assessment, which covers a longer time frame. The original statement by the UN OCHA head was a miscommunication, using an urgent timeframe figuratively rather than as a literal prediction of immediate deaths. Media initially misreported the claim but later corrected it based on the IPC’s actual findings.; No, 14,000 Gaza Infants Are Not Expected to Die Within 48 Hours, But Malnutrition Risk Remains High;Claim: 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within the next 48 hours if emergency aid cannot reach them. Evidence:  The claim originated from Tom Fletcher, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), during a BBC Radio 4 program. He stated, 14,000 babies will die in the next 48 hours if we can't get to them, to emphasize the urgent need for aid.  OCHA spokesperson Jens Lærke clarified that Fletcher's wording was unclear. He explained that Fletcher should have said that 14,000 babies are very likely to suffer from severe acute malnutrition, meaning they are in danger of death and urgently need help.  The figure of 14,000 (specifically 14,100) comes from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), which assesses food security globally. The IPC states that this number of children under five are at risk of severe acute malnutrition.  However, the IPC clarifies that this risk means they could die from malnutrition within the next year if they do not receive treatment, not within 48 hours.  Jens Lærke confirmed that the 48-hour timeframe was a figure of speech to stress urgency, as Israel had indicated a temporary window for aid delivery, though no specific timeframe was set.  Danish media outlet Ritzau initially reported the 48-hour timeframe but later issued a correction, aligning with the IPC's projection of a one-year period for children under five. Verdict: False. While it is true that approximately 14,000 infants (children under five) in Gaza are at risk of severe acute malnutrition and potential death, the timeframe of within 48 hours is incorrect. This was a misstatement by a UN official, clarified by OCHA and the IPC, who indicate the risk of death from malnutrition is over the next year if treatment is not received. The situation in Gaza regarding child malnutrition remains critical.;1. What is the claim being assessed? The claim being assessed is that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within the next 48 hours if emergency aid cannot reach them. 2. What is the final verdict? The final verdict is False, with important context. 3. Explain how the evidence supports the verdict in a clear and concise manner. The evidence clearly shows that the specific timeframe of within 48 hours for the deaths of 14,000 infants is incorrect. While the figure of approximately 14,000 children under five being at risk of severe acute malnutrition is accurate and comes from the IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification), the IPC explicitly states that this risk means they could die from malnutrition over the next year if untreated, not within two days. OCHA spokesperson Jens Lærke clarified that Tom Fletcher's original statement on the BBC was an unclear wording and that the 48-hour period was a figure of speech to emphasize the extreme urgency of the humanitarian situation and the temporary nature of aid access. Therefore, while the severe risk to thousands of children due to malnutrition in Gaza is real and urgent, the immediate death timeline of 48 hours is false.;False Claim: UN Official Misstates Timeframe for Infant Deaths in Gaza, 14,000 Babies Not at Risk of Dying Within 48 Hours;The claim being evaluated is that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within 48 hours if they don't receive emergency aid, as stated by Tom Fletcher, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), on the BBC's Radio 4 Today program. The key evidence provided includes: OCHA's response to the BBC, which points to the urgent need to save an estimated 14,000 infants suffering from severe acute malnutrition in Gaza. IPC's statement on May 12 about acute food insecurity in Gaza, emphasizing the need for immediate action to prevent further deaths and malnutrition. IPC's explanation to TjekDet that OCHA's interpretation is inaccurate and that 14,100 children under five are at risk of severe acute malnutrition, potentially leading to death within a year if untreated, not within 48 hours. Jens Lærke's clarification that Tom Fletcher's wording was unclear and should have specified that 14,000 babies are at risk of severe acute malnutrition. The verdict is: False. The evidence shows that Tom Fletcher's statement was misleading, and the actual risk is that 14,100 children under five may die from malnutrition within a year if left untreated, not within 48 hours as claimed. OCHA acknowledges the need for urgent aid, but the timeframe and specifics of the claim are incorrect ¹.;Claim: 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within 48 hours if they don't receive emergency aid, as stated by Tom Fletcher, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). Verdict: False Explanation: The evidence shows that the IPC, which provided the estimate of 14,100 children under five at risk of severe acute malnutrition, clarifies that this risk pertains to death within a year if left untreated, not within 48 hours. OCHA's spokesperson, Jens Lærke, acknowledges that Tom Fletcher's wording was unclear and should have specified the risk of severe acute malnutrition rather than death within 48 hours. The 48-hour timeframe mentioned by Tom Fletcher is described as a figure of speech to emphasize urgency rather than a literal deadline. Therefore, the claim is deemed false due to the inaccurate timeframe and specifics of the risk.;UN Official’s Claim of 14,000 Gaza Infants Dying in 48 Hours Proven False;Claim: Tom Fletcher, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), stated on BBC Radio 4 that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within 48 hours if emergency aid is not delivered. Evidence: The fact-check reveals that Fletcher’s statement was inaccurate. Jens Lærke, OCHA spokesperson, clarified to TjekDet that Fletcher meant 14,000 infants are at risk of severe acute malnutrition, which could lead to death without urgent aid, but not necessarily within 48 hours. The figure originates from the IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification), which estimates 14,100 children under five in Gaza are at risk of severe acute malnutrition over the next year (April 2025 to March 2026), not within two days. The IPC called OCHA’s interpretation “inaccurate.” Lærke explained the 48-hour timeframe was a figure of speech to emphasize urgency, as Israel’s window for aid delivery is temporary but not strictly time-bound. Danish media initially reported the 48-hour claim but later corrected it to reflect the IPC’s one-year projection. Verdict: The claim is false. The evidence shows that while 14,000 infants in Gaza are at risk of severe acute malnutrition, the claim that they will die within 48 hours is a misrepresentation. The risk spans a year, and the 48-hour timeframe was an exaggeration to highlight urgency.;Claim: Tom Fletcher, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), stated on BBC Radio 4 that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within 48 hours if emergency aid is not delivered. Verdict: False. Explanation: The evidence shows that Fletcher’s claim was inaccurate. OCHA’s spokesperson, Jens Lærke, clarified that the 14,000 infants are at risk of severe acute malnutrition, which could lead to death over time without aid, but not specifically within 48 hours. The IPC, the source of the figure, estimates 14,100 children under five are at risk over a year (April 2025 to March 2026), not two days. The 48-hour timeframe was a rhetorical device to stress urgency, not a factual deadline. This discrepancy, confirmed by both the IPC and OCHA’s corrections to media, demonstrates the claim’s falsehood.

Key evidence used to assess the claim:  The figure of 14,000 comes from Tom Fletcher, head of the UN OCHA, who stated on BBC Radio 4 that 14,000 babies would die in the next 48 hours without aid.  OCHA later clarified through spokesperson Jens Lærke that Fletcher’s wording was misleading; the 14,000 figure refers to infants at risk of severe acute malnutrition, not certain death within 48 hours.

Official sources clarified that the original statement was misleading.;False: Claim of 14,000 Gaza Infants Dying in 48 Hours Misrepresents Malnutrition Risk;The claim evaluated is that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within 48 hours if aid does not reach them. The key evidence used to assess this claim includes:  Tom Fletcher's statement: The head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), Tom Fletcher, stated on BBC Radio 4 that 14,000 babies will die in the next 48 hours if we can't get to them.  OCHA's clarification: Jens Lærke, spokesperson for OCHA, clarified that Fletcher should have said that 14,000 babies are very likely to suffer from severe acute malnutrition, meaning they are in danger of death and urgently need help, but not necessarily within 48 hours.

The verdict is false. While there is an urgent and critical situation regarding malnutrition among 14,000 children under five in Gaza who are at risk of death over the next year if untreated, the claim that 14,000 infants will die within 48 hours is incorrect. The 48-hour timeframe was a rhetorical emphasis, and the risk of death, according to the original source (IPC), is over a much longer period (one year) for children under five, not specifically infants, due to severe acute malnutrition.;Here's the verdict for the fact-check: 1. What is the claim being evaluated? The claim being evaluated is that 14,000 infants in Gaza will die within the next 48 hours if emergency aid cannot reach them. 2. Is the claim true, false, or mixed or other relevant category of verdict? False. 3. Provide a brief explanation for your decision based on the evidence presented in the fact-check. The claim is false because the original source of the figure, the IPC, states that 14,100 children (under five, not exclusively infants) in Gaza are at risk of severe acute malnutrition and could die within the next year if they do not receive treatment. OCHA's spokesperson clarified that Tom Fletcher's statement about 48 hours was a figure of speech to emphasize urgency, not a precise deadline, and that he should have referred to the risk of severe acute malnutrition over a longer period.

Key Evidence: IPC Report: The IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification) partnership warned about acute food insecurity in Gaza, estimating 14,100 children under five are at risk of severe acute malnutrition, which could lead to death within a year if untreated. OCHA's Interpretation: OCHA interpreted the IPC report to emphasize urgency, stating the need to deliver aid within 48 hours to save these infants, but this interpretation was deemed inaccurate by the IPC. Timeline: The IPC report mentions a period from April 2025 to March 2026 for potential malnutrition risks, contradicting the 48-hour timeframe. Verdict: False.

FC_10;Bullet point summary; Images of Danish school classes are misused in international propaganda;Two class photos from Danish schools are going around the world these months. In one class photo, which is of a 9th grader from the school year 2010;This is the fact to check: Two class photos from Danish schools, which are seen by millions of users on social media, especially abroad, are being misused as documentation that there is apparently a population replacement in Denmark.  This is how you change a country. See the difference between 2010 and 2025 at a school in Denmark, reads a caption for a post on the social media X.  “Same country, same city, same school, same class, but ten years apart,” reads another post.  The class photos have also been shared by the X-profile Radio Genoa, one of the most well-known voices critical of immigrants on the platform. The profile is followed by more than a million users. Across social media, the photos have been seen by millions of people.  But the pictures cannot be used to document that there is a population change in Denmark. They are neither the same class nor the same school, and there is also a good explanation for the difference in the student composition in the two pictures.  This also suggests that people in Russia are involved in the dissemination of the images. We will return to that part. Zero This is what the post from Radio Genoa looks like on the X platform. The post has been viewed by almost half a million users. CheckIt has chosen to blur the faces in the pictures. Different schools with different students However, it is correct that both images originate from Danish schools.  The first - with the ethnically Danish students - was taken by 9A at Bjerregrav School west of Randers in the school year 2010/2011. The school is a regular elementary school.  The second photo is also taken by a 9th grader, but from an international private school near Copenhagen that has many Muslim students. It was taken in connection with the 2017/2018 school year, according to the school's website - and is therefore not from 2025, as claimed in the posts.  It is therefore not surprising that a primary school in Randers has fewer students with a background other than Danish than an international school near Copenhagen.  Headmaster at Bjerregrav School, Marlene Ankjær, tells TjekDet that she is upset that a picture from her school is being used in misinformation.  It is very unfortunate that we are being used in a context that is intended to create concern and division.

In the 2023/2024 school year, the figure is zero percent. Here, the student composition has therefore gone in the opposite direction to what the postings on X claim.  Nationally, there has been a slight increase in the number of non-Western students. In the 2023/2024 school year, students with a non-Western background made up 11.8 percent of students in the country's primary, secondary and private schools.

Manipulated Context: The 2010 photo is from a public school in Randers with mostly ethnically Danish students, while the other is from an international private school near Copenhagen with many Muslim students—explaining the different compositions.  Propaganda Use: The misleading images have been widely shared on social media and picked up by far-right and pro-Russian channels to promote the “Great Replacement” theory, despite Danish statistics showing only a modest national increase in non-Western students (from 9.1% in 2010 to 11.8% in 2024).;Verdict: False The claim that the two class photos show demographic change in the same Danish school over time is false. The photos are from different schools, cities, and years, and cannot be used to document a population replacement in Denmark. The context has been deliberately misrepresented to support a misleading narrative.;False Claim: Danish School Photos Don't Show Population Replacement – They're From Different Schools and Years;Two class photos circulated on social media, claiming to show a population replacement in Danish schools between 2010 and 2025, are misleading. The photos are from different schools and different years (2010/2011 and 2017/2018), not the same school ten years apart.  The first photo is from a public elementary school in Randers, Bjerregrav School, which had 2.6% non-Western students in 2010/2011 and 0% in 2023/2024. The second photo is from an international private school near Copenhagen, which naturally has a higher proportion of students with diverse backgrounds.  Nationally, the proportion of students with a non-Western background in Danish primary, secondary, and private schools increased from 9.1% in 2010/2011 to 11.8% in 2023/2024. The misuse of these images is linked to misinformation campaigns, including those by pro-Russian actors, promoting theories of population replacement.;False. The claim that the two class photos document a population replacement in Denmark by showing the same school or class over time is demonstrably false. The photos are from different schools, taken in different years, and the student demographics at the specific school in the first photo have actually shifted in the opposite direction of the claim.;Misleading School Photos Falsely Claim Population Replacement in Denmark;Two class photos from different Danish schools (Bjerregrav School in Randers and an international private school near Copenhagen) were misused on social media to claim a population replacement in Denmark, despite being taken in different years (2010/2011 and 2017/2018) and featuring different student demographics. The photos were shared by accounts promoting anti-immigrant views, including Radio Genoa with over a million followers, and were seen by millions of users, with some posts falsely claiming the photos showed the same school and class 15 years apart. The fact-check found no evidence to support the claim of significant demographic change in Danish schools based on these photos, and national statistics show only a slight increase in non-Western students from 9.1% in 2010/2011 to 11.8% in 2023/2024.

The claim that the two class photos document a population replacement in Denmark is false because: The photos are from different schools and not the same class. The photos were taken in different years, not 15 years apart as claimed. The statistics from the Ministry of Children and Education do not support the narrative of a significant population shift in the direction claimed.

The second photo is also taken by a 9th grader, but from an international private school near Copenhagen that has many Muslim students. It was taken in connection with the 2017/2018 school year, according to the school's website - and is therefore not from 2025, as claimed in the posts.  It is therefore not surprising that a primary school in Randers has fewer students with a background other than Danish than an international school near Copenhagen.

TjekDet has previously reported how a video of students on a field trip was abused to claim that the students had converted to Islam.;Ask-me-anything;False Claim: Viral Danish School Photos Misused to Promote “Population Replacement” Narrative;Here is the summary of the fact-check in three bullet points: 1. Claim Being Verified: Two class photos from Danish schools are being shared on social media with the claim that they show a dramatic demographic shift over time (from 2010 to 2025) at the same school, suggesting evidence of a population replacement in Denmark. 2. Main Evidence Used:  The two photos are from different schools: one from Bjerregrav School (a public school in rural Denmark, taken in 2010/2011) and the other from an international private school near Copenhagen (taken in 2017/2018, not 2025).  The student composition difference is explained by the nature and location of the schools.  Official statistics show that Bjerregrav School had 2.6% non-Western students in 2010/2011 and 0% in 2023/2024. Nationally, non-Western student representation rose only slightly from 9.1% to 11.8% between those years. 3. Verdict: False The claim is false because the photos are not from the same school or the same time period, and do not reflect a national population replacement. The misleading comparison misrepresents demographic trends and is being used to promote a false narrative, amplified by far-right and pro-Russian social media channels.;Here is the verdict of the fact-check based on the provided information: 1. What is the claim being verified? That two class photos—allegedly from the same school, same class, and ten or fifteen years apart (2010 and 2025)—prove there is a demographic or population replacement occurring in Denmark. 2. What is the final verdict? False 3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict?  The two photos are not from the same school: one is from Bjerregrav School (2010/2011), a public school in rural Denmark, and the other is from an international private school near Copenhagen (2017/2018), not 2025 as claimed.  The differences in student ethnic composition are explained by school type and geographic location, not by national demographic shifts.  Official statistics show that non-Western student representation at Bjerregrav School has actually decreased, from 2.6% in 2010/2011 to 0% in 2023/2024.  Nationally, the increase in non-Western students has been modest, from 9.1% to 11.8% over more than a decade.  The images are being deliberately misused and amplified by far-right and pro-Russian actors to spread the false Great Replacement narrative.;Here's a headline for the fact-check: Misleading Danish School Photos Falsely Claim Population Replacement;Claim Being Verified: The claim being verified is that two class photos from Danish schools, widely shared on social media, document a population replacement in Denmark, showing a significant shift in student demographics from 2010 to 2025 (or ten years apart), with an increase in students of non-Danish background.  Main Evidence Used: The main evidence used to refute the claim is that the two photos are not from the same school or the same class, nor are they from the years claimed. The first photo (predominantly ethnically Danish students) is from Bjerregrav School in Randers in 2010/2011, a regular elementary school. The second photo (with many Muslim students) is from an international private school near Copenhagen in 2017/2018. Additionally, national statistics from the Danish Ministry of Children and Education show that while there has been a slight increase in students with a non-Western background nationwide (from 9.1% in 2010/2011 to 11.8% in 2023/2024), the specific school in the first photo (Bjerregrav School) actually saw a decrease in non-Western students.  Verdict and Key Reasons: The verdict is False. The key reasons are that the photos are misrepresented in terms of school, class, and year. The comparison is misleading because it juxtaposes a photo from a local primary school in a less diverse area with a photo from an international private school known to have many Muslim students. Furthermore, while there has been a slight national increase in non-Western students, the specific example of Bjerregrav School contradicts the narrative of population replacement. The fact-check also suggests the images are being used as part of Russian propaganda to promote the Great Replacement theory.;1. What is the claim being verified? The claim being verified is that two class photos from Danish schools, shared widely on social media, demonstrate a population replacement in Denmark, specifically showing a stark demographic shift in student composition between 2010 and 2025 (or over a ten-year period) towards a non-Danish or Muslim majority. 2. What is the final verdict (True/False/Mixed)? False 3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict? The verdict is supported by the following evidence and reasoning:  Misrepresentation of Schools and Dates: The two photos are not from the same school or the same class. The first photo (predominantly ethnically Danish students) is from Bjerregrav School, a regular elementary school, taken in 2010/2011. The second photo (with many Muslim students) is from an international private school near Copenhagen, taken in 2017/2018. The claim that the second photo is from 2025 is also false.  Contextual Differences: It is not surprising that a primary school in a less diverse area (Randers) would have fewer students with a non-Danish background than an international private school near a major city (Copenhagen) that caters to a diverse student body.  Contradictory Local Data: At Bjerregrav School, where the first photo was taken, the percentage of non-Western students actually decreased from 2.6% in 2010/2011 to 0% in 2023/2024, directly contradicting the claim of population replacement at that specific school.  National Data Does Not Support Replacement: While there has been a slight national increase in students with a non-Western background in Denmark (from 9.1% in 2010/2011 to 11.8% in 2023/2024), this does not support the dramatic narrative of population replacement implied by the misused photos.  Propaganda Use: The images have been spread as Russian propaganda, supporting the Great Replacement theory, which serves a political agenda rather than reflecting factual demographic changes.;False Claim: Danish School Photos Don't Show Dramatic Demographic Shift;Claim being verified: The claim is that two class photos from Danish schools show a population replacement in Denmark, with captions suggesting a significant change in the country's demographics between 2010 and 2025. Main evidence: The fact-checking investigation reveals that the two photos are not from the same school or class, and one photo is from 2010/2011 while the other is from 2017/2018, not 2025 as claimed. The investigation also provides data on the actual demographics of Danish schools, showing a slight increase in non-Western students nationally, but not supporting the dramatic change implied by the claim. Verdict: The verdict is FALSE. The key reasons are that the photos are not comparable (different schools, classes, and years), and the claim misrepresents the actual demographic changes in Danish schools. Additionally, the investigation suggests that the images have been spread as part of a larger narrative of The Great Replacement theory, which is being promoted by pro-Russian actors.;Here are the answers to the questions: Claim being verified: The claim is that two class photos from Danish schools document a population replacement in Denmark, implying a significant demographic shift in the country. Final verdict: FALSE Evidence supporting the verdict: The evidence supporting this verdict includes: The two photos are not from the same school or class, contrary to the claim. The photos were taken in different years (2010/2011 and 2017/2018), not 2010 and 2025 as claimed. The demographics of the schools in the photos are not representative of the national trend, and the difference in student composition can be explained by the fact that one school is a regular elementary school in a different location than the other, which is an international private school near Copenhagen. Actual demographic data from the Ministry of Children and Education shows a slight increase in non-Western students nationally, but not to the extent implied by the claim. In fact, the school in Randers had a decrease in non-Western students from 2.6% to 0% between 2010/2011 and 2023/2024.;Viral Claim of 'Population Replacement' in Danish Schools Debunked as False;Claim being verified: Two class photos from Danish schools, purportedly from the same school and class taken in 2010 and 2025, are being used on social media to claim a population replacement in Denmark, suggesting a significant shift in student demographics toward a Muslim majority. - Main evidence used: The first photo is from Bjerregrav School (2010/2011, 9th grade, 2.6% non-Western students), and the second is from an international private school near Copenhagen (2017/2018, with many Muslim students), not from 2025. Ministry data shows a slight national increase in non-Western students (9.1% in 2010/2011 to 11.8% in 2023/2024), while Bjerregrav School’s non-Western student percentage dropped to 0% by 2023/2024. - Verdict: False. The photos are not from the same school or class, and the second photo is from 2017/2018, not 2025.

Evidence: The fact-check reveals that the photos are not from the same school, class, or year. One is from a public school in Randers in 2010/2011 with mostly ethnically Danish students, and the other is from an international private school near Copenhagen taken in 2017/2018, with a more diverse student body. Demographic data shows no such drastic change at the Randers school—in fact, the percentage of non-Western students there dropped to 0% by 2023/2024.  Verdict: The claim is false. The images are being misused out of context to push a misleading narrative. The photos do not show the same school or class, and overall student demographic changes in Denmark are moderate, not extreme. The narrative is further amplified by pro-Russian actors to fuel divisive theories like “The Great Replacement.”; Verdict: False 1. Claim Being Evaluated: The claim suggests that two class photos — one from 2010 and one from 2025 — taken at the same Danish school and class show a dramatic ethnic shift, proving a population replacement is occurring in Denmark. 2. Key Evidence Reviewed:  The photos are not from the same class or school:  The 2010 photo is from 9A at Bjerregrav School, a public school west of Randers.  The other photo is from an international private school near Copenhagen, taken in 2017/2018, not 2025.  The schools serve different populations:  Bjerregrav had 2.6% non-Western students in 2010/2011, and 0% in 2023/2024, contradicting the claim of increasing diversity there.  The private school near Copenhagen has many Muslim students, which explains its different composition.  Nationally, the percentage of non-Western students has increased moderately from 9.1% (2010/2011) to 11.8% (2023/2024), not radically as the claim implies.  The photos have been used by far-right and pro-Russian actors to spread the Great Replacement narrative, despite their misleading context. 3. Justification: The claim is false because the two photos are misrepresented: they are from different years, schools, and contexts. No reliable evidence supports the idea of a drastic demographic shift at the school level as claimed. The use of the photos to imply national-level ethnic replacement is misleading and unsupported by the data.;Danish School Photos Don't Show Population Replacement, Photos Misused in Disinformation Campaign;Claim: Social media posts, particularly on X, claim that two class photos from Danish schools taken in 2010 and 2025 (or ten years apart) show a population replacement in Denmark, with a significant increase in students of non-Danish ethnicity, specifically Muslim students, implying a demographic shift.  Evidence: The fact-check reveals that the photos are not from the same school or even the same year. The first photo is from a public elementary school in Randers from 2010/2011, where non-Western students constituted 2.6% (and 0% in 2023/2024). The second photo is from an international private school near Copenhagen from 2017/2018, which naturally has many international and Muslim students, and is not from 2025. Nationally, the proportion of non-Western students in Danish schools increased from 9.1% in 2010/2011 to 11.8% in 2023/2024, a slight increase but not indicative of the drastic replacement suggested by the misleading comparison. The dissemination of these images is also linked to Russian propaganda aiming to promote The Great Replacement theory.  Verdict: The claim is false. The pictures are being misused and do not document a population change in Denmark in the way suggested. The difference in student composition is due to the photos being from different types of schools (a local public school versus an international private school) and different years, not a widespread population replacement. The national statistics show a slight increase in non-Western students, but not the radical shift implied by the miscontextualized photos.;Verdict: False The claim that two Danish class photos from 2010 and 2025 (or ten years apart) demonstrate a population replacement in Denmark is demonstrably false. Here's why:  Misleading Comparison: The two photos are not from the same school or even taken consistently ten years apart or in 2025 as claimed. The first photo is from a typical public elementary school in Randers in 2010/2011, while the second is from an international private school near Copenhagen in 2017/2018, which by its nature caters to a diverse student body including many Muslim students.  Contextual Discrepancy: It is inherently misleading to compare a local public school in a less diverse area to an international private school near the capital when attempting to draw conclusions about national demographics.  Actual Demographic Data: Official statistics from the Ministry of Children and Education show that while there has been a slight increase in non-Western students nationally (from 9.1% in 2010/2011 to 11.8% in 2023/2024), this is a modest rise and does not support the drastic population replacement narrative propagated by the images. In the specific case of the Bjerregrav School from the first photo, the percentage of non-Western students actually decreased to zero in 2023/2024.  Disinformation Campaign: The spread of these images is also linked to pro-Russian propaganda, which often promotes The Great Replacement theory to portray Western decay and serve its own political agenda. The headmaster of the Bjerregrav School has expressed upset about the misuse of her school's image for misinformation.;False Claim: Class Photos Do Not Show 'Population Replacement' in Denmark;Claim being evaluated: The claim is that two class photos from Danish schools show a population replacement in Denmark, with captions suggesting a significant change in the country's demographics between 2010 and 2025. Main evidence: The fact-check reveals that the photos are not from the same school or class, and one photo is from 2010/2011 while the other is from 2017/2018, not 2025 as claimed. The schools' demographics are also different, with one being a regular elementary school in Randers and the other an international private school near Copenhagen with many Muslim students. According to the Ministry of Children and Education, the student composition at Bjerregrav School actually went in the opposite direction of the claim, and nationally, there was only a slight increase in non-Western students. Verdict: The fact-check concludes that the photos cannot be used to document a population change in Denmark, and the claim is false. The photos have been misused to create concern and division, and their dissemination appears to be linked to Russian propaganda efforts promoting the Great Replacement theory.;Verdict: False The claim being evaluated is that two class photos from Danish schools show a population replacement in Denmark, with captions suggesting a significant change in the country's demographics between 2010 and 2025. The key evidence provided to assess the claim includes: The photos are not from the same school or class, contrary to the captions' claims. One photo is from 2010/2011, while the other is from 2017/2018, not 2025 as claimed. The schools' demographics are different, with one being a regular elementary school in Randers and the other an international private school near Copenhagen with many Muslim students. The student composition at Bjerregrav School actually went in the opposite direction of the claim, with non-Western students decreasing from 2.6% to 0% between 2010/2011 and 2023/2024. Nationally, there was only a slight increase in non-Western students, from 9.1% to 11.8% between 2010/2011 and 2023/2024. Based on this evidence, the claim is false because: The photos are not comparable due to differences in school type, location, and year. The captions' claims about the photos are inaccurate and misleading. The data on student demographics does not support the claim of a significant population replacement in Denmark. Overall, the evidence suggests that the claim is a misrepresentation of the facts, and its dissemination appears to be linked to promoting a specific narrative or agenda.;False Claim Debunked: Danish School Photos Misused to Suggest Population Replacement;Claim: Two class photos from Danish schools, purportedly from the same school and class taken in 2010 and 2025, are shared on social media to suggest a population replacement in Denmark, implying a significant shift in student demographics toward a Muslim majority. - Evidence: The photos are from different schools: one from Bjerregrav School (2010/2011, mostly ethnically Danish students) and another from an international private school near Copenhagen (2017/2018, with many Muslim students). Ministry data shows Bjerregrav had 2.6% non-Western students in 2010/2011, dropping to 0% by 2023/2024, while nationally, non-Western students increased slightly from 9.1% to 11.8%. The photos were also misused in Russian propaganda to support a Great Replacement narrative. - Verdict: The claim is false. The photos do not depict the same school or class, and the timeline is incorrect (2017/2018, not 2025). The demographic shift implied is not supported by data, as Bjerregrav School's non-Western student population decreased, and the national increase in non-Western students is modest. The misuse of these images promotes a misleading narrative of population replacement.;Verdict: False Claim: Two class photos from Danish schools, allegedly from the same school and class in 2010 and 2025, are used on social media to claim a population replacement in Denmark, suggesting a significant demographic shift toward a Muslim majority. Key Evidence: - The photos are from different schools: one from Bjerregrav School (2010/2011, mostly ethnically Danish students) and another from an international private school near Copenhagen (2017/2018, with many Muslim students), not 2025 as claimed. - Ministry of Children and Education data shows Bjerregrav School had 2.6% non-Western students in 2010/2011, which dropped to 0% by 2023/2024. Nationally, non-Western students increased slightly from 9.1% in 2010/2011 to 11.8% in 2023/2024, not indicating a drastic demographic shift. - The photos have been misused, including by Russian propaganda, to promote a Great Replacement narrative, despite the images not supporting the claim of a consistent or dramatic population change. Justification: The claim is false because the photos do not depict the same school or class, and the timeline (2017/2018, not 2025) is incorrect. Data contradicts the narrative of a significant population replacement, as Bjerregrav School shows a decrease in non-Western students, and the national increase is modest. The misleading use of these images to suggest a dramatic demographic shift lacks factual basis.
FC_10;Bullet point summary; Images of Danish school classes are misused in international propaganda;Two class photos from Danish schools are going around the world these months. In one class photo, which is of a 9th grader from the school year 2010;This is the fact to check: Two class photos from Danish schools, which are seen by millions of users on social media, especially abroad, are being misused as documentation that there is apparently a population replacement in Denmark.  This is how you change a country. See the difference between 2010 and 2025 at a school in Denmark, reads a caption for a post on the social media X.  “Same country, same city, same school, same class, but ten years apart,” reads another post.  The class photos have also been shared by the X-profile Radio Genoa, one of the most well-known voices critical of immigrants on the platform. The profile is followed by more than a million users. Across social media, the photos have been seen by millions of people.  But the pictures cannot be used to document that there is a population change in Denmark. They are neither the same class nor the same school, and there is also a good explanation for the difference in the student composition in the two pictures.  This also suggests that people in Russia are involved in the dissemination of the images. We will return to that part. Zero This is what the post from Radio Genoa looks like on the X platform. The post has been viewed by almost half a million users. CheckIt has chosen to blur the faces in the pictures. Different schools with different students However, it is correct that both images originate from Danish schools.  The first - with the ethnically Danish students - was taken by 9A at Bjerregrav School west of Randers in the school year 2010/2011. The school is a regular elementary school.  The second photo is also taken by a 9th grader, but from an international private school near Copenhagen that has many Muslim students. It was taken in connection with the 2017/2018 school year, according to the school's website - and is therefore not from 2025, as claimed in the posts.  It is therefore not surprising that a primary school in Randers has fewer students with a background other than Danish than an international school near Copenhagen.  Headmaster at Bjerregrav School, Marlene Ankjær, tells TjekDet that she is upset that a picture from her school is being used in misinformation.  It is very unfortunate that we are being used in a context that is intended to create concern and division. Therefore, we have of course also reported the user on Facebook who is making this form of fake news, she says.  It has not been possible for TjekDet to get a comment from the international school near Copenhagen.  But what does the development of the numbers actually look like?  The Ministry of Children and Education calculates the distribution of students in Danish schools based on cultural circles, which include the categories 'Denmark', 'Western' and 'non-Western'.  At Bjerregrav School in the 2010/2011 school year, when the photos of the 9th grade students were taken, non-Western students made up 2.6 percent. In the 2023/2024 school year, the figure is zero percent. Here, the student composition has therefore gone in the opposite direction to what the postings on X claim.  Nationally, there has been a slight increase in the number of non-Western students. In the 2023/2024 school year, students with a non-Western background made up 11.8 percent of students in the country's primary, secondary and private schools. In the 2010/2011 school year, the proportion was 9.1 percent. Checked Who are the non-Western foreigners everyone is talking about? From TikTok to Russian propaganda TjekDet has not been able to trace the first sharing of the misleading comparison between the two class photos with certainty. The earliest we have been able to find dates from April 15 on X and Instagram. On Instagram, the photos were shared by the far-right page “Europe on Top”. The post has more than 32,000 likes.  However, the text on the images reveals that they originally came from TikTok - this can be seen in the distinctive font.  In other similar posts on X, you can see that the pictures of the school classes are taken as screenshots from TikTok. At the bottom right, you can see that the post on TikTok, where the screenshot was taken, has a whopping 378,000 likes.  TjekDet has not been able to find the images on TikTok.  However, we can see that a few days later the images are being spread as Russian propaganda on Russian websites and by major channels on Telegram.  Among others, by Russian senator Alexey Pushkov, who writes about the photos:  “School class photos in Denmark in 2010 and 2025. The point of no return has been reached.” Checked How five dirty men and a 'Middle Eastern' family ended up in the same photo Another pro-Russian channel on Telegram with more than half a million followers writes about the images:  “A bit of horror. This is how the graduating classes in Denmark have changed over 15 years. If we don't stop the development, we'll soon have the same thing here.”  It is no coincidence that the images have been picked up by pro-Russian actors. The images support a theory of population replacement, which states that Danes will be outnumbered in Denmark in the future in favor of a Muslim majority.  A theory that Russia has often  promoted  because it serves as an example of Western decay for Russia, while at the same time the theory is used to create national cohesion within Russia.  Sign up for the CheckIt newsletter The theory has existed for many years, and is also known internationally as “ The Great Replacement ” - which is perhaps why the posts about schools in Denmark have been shared by so many people on social media.  This is not the first time that Danish schoolchildren have been abused to create a similar false narrative. TjekDet has previously reported how a video of students on a field trip was abused to claim that the students had converted to Islam.;Contextual;False Claim: Danish Class Photos Misused to Falsely Suggest Population Replacement;The claim: Social media posts assert that two class photos—one from 2010 and another labeled as 2025—show drastic demographic change at the same Danish school, allegedly proving a population replacement in Denmark.  The evidence: The photos are from two different schools and years: the 2010/2011 photo is from Bjerregrav School in rural Denmark, while the second is from an international private school near Copenhagen taken in 2017/2018. Bjerregrav had 2.6% non-Western students in 2010/2011 and 0% in 2023/2024. Nationally, non-Western student representation increased modestly from 9.1% to 11.8% over the same period. The photos were misleadingly circulated by far-right and pro-Russian social media accounts.  The verdict: False. The photos do not depict the same class, school, or time period, and cannot be used to support claims of a population replacement in Denmark. The demographic shift suggested in the posts is not reflected in actual data.;"1. Claim being assessed: The claim is that two class photos—from the same Danish school, taken about ten years apart (2010 and 2025)—show a dramatic demographic change, allegedly proving a population replacement in Denmark. 2. Verdict: False. 3. Reasoning/Evidence: The photos are not from the same school or the same year; the first photo is from a public school in rural Denmark in 2010/2011, while the second is from an international private school near Copenhagen in 2017/2018. Student demographics at the first school actually show a decrease in non-Western students, contradicting the claim. National data also indicate only a modest increase in non-Western students overall. The images have been widely misused and circulated by far-right and pro-Russian sources to push a misleading narrative of population replacement, but the factual data and context clearly refute this claim.";"Danish School Photos Don't Prove Population Replacement; Images Misleadingly Paired";The Claim: Social media posts, particularly on X, assert that two class photos from Danish schools (one from 2010 and another supposedly from 2025) document a population replacement in Denmark, claiming they are from the same class, same school, and ten years apart.  The Evidence: The fact-check reveals that the photos are not from the same school or class, nor are they ten years apart. The first photo is from a public school in Randers from 2010/2011, predominantly featuring ethnically Danish students. The second is from an international private school near Copenhagen from 2017/2018, which has many Muslim students. National data from the Ministry of Children and Education shows that while non-Western students nationally increased from 9.1% in 2010/2011 to 11.8% in 2023/2024, the specific public school in the first photo saw its non-Western student population decrease from 2.6% to 0% in the same period. The spread of these images is also linked to Russian propaganda, supporting the Great Replacement theory.  The Verdict: False. The claim is based on misidentified and misrepresented photos. The pictures do not document a population replacement in Denmark, as they are from different schools with different demographics and timeframes, and the national student composition change is far less dramatic than implied.;Here's the final verdict based on the fact-check: 1. What is the claim being assessed? The claim being assessed is that two widely circulated class photos from Danish schools (one from 2010 and another supposedly from 2025) demonstrate a population replacement in Denmark. Specifically, it's asserted that these photos are from the same country, same city, same school, same class, but ten years apart, showing a dramatic shift in student demographics, particularly an increase in non-ethnically Danish students. 2. What is the verdict? False. 3. What reasoning or evidence supports this decision? The verdict is false for several key reasons:  Misidentified Schools and Classes: The two photos are not from the same school or class. The first photo, showing predominantly ethnically Danish students, was taken at Bjerregrav School, a regular elementary school west of Randers, in 2010/2011. The second photo, showing many Muslim students, was taken at an international private school near Copenhagen in 2017/2018, not 2025 as claimed.  Different School Types and Demographics: It's not surprising that a rural public school and an international private school near the capital would have different student compositions. The international school is known to cater to a diverse student body, including many Muslim students.  Actual Demographic Trends: Data from the Ministry of Children and Education shows that while there has been a slight national increase in non-Western students in Denmark (from 9.1% in 2010/2011 to 11.8% in 2023/2024), the specific Bjerregrav School in the first photo actually saw its non-Western student population decrease to zero percent by 2023/2024, directly contradicting the claim for that specific school.  Misinformation Campaign: The fact-check also highlights that these images are being deliberately misused as misinformation, with involvement from pro-Russian actors and far-right social media accounts to promote the Great Replacement theory, which posits a future Muslim majority in Denmark.;False: Class Photos Don't Show Dramatic 'Population Replacement' in Denmark;The claim: Social media posts are claiming that two class photos from Danish schools, taken in 2010 and 2025, demonstrate a population replacement in Denmark, with captions suggesting a significant change in the country's demographics over time.

Nationally, there was a slight increase in non-Western students from 9.1% to 11.8% during the same period. The verdict: The claim is false.

Data from the schools and national statistics show no evidence of a sudden demographic “replacement.” In fact, the first school’s non-Western student percentage decreased over time. The photos were manipulated and shared by far-right social media accounts and later by pro-Russian channels aiming to sow division. Danish school officials have condemned the misuse of these images. Therefore, the evidence clearly refutes the claim and shows it to be misinformation designed to promote a false narrative of population replacement in Denmark.;Sure! Here’s the verdict breakdown: --- 1. What is the claim being evaluated? That two class photos from Danish schools, supposedly taken in 2010 and 2025 at the same school and class, demonstrate a dramatic demographic change proving a population replacement in Denmark. 2. Based on the evidence provided, is the claim true, false, mixed or another verdict category? False. 3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict?  The photos are from different schools (a public school in 2010/11 and an international private school in 2017/18), not the same school or class.  The second photo is not from 2025 but from several years earlier, invalidating the timeline.  The student demographic data from the public school contradicts the claim, showing no increase but actually a decrease in non-Western students.  National data show only a slight increase in non-Western students overall, not a sudden “replacement.”  The photos have been manipulated and used by far-right and pro-Russian actors to promote divisive misinformation. ---  Final verdict: The claim is false. The evidence shows that the photos do not depict the same school or year, the timeline is incorrect, and demographic data contradict the assertion of a rapid population replacement. The photos have been misused to spread misinformation and promote a false narrative about Denmark’s population.;False: Danish School Photos Don't Show Population Replacement, Misused by Disinformation Campaigns;"1. Verdict: False. 2. Evidence: The photos are not from the same school or the same class, and they were taken in different years (2010/2011 and 2017/2018), not 2010 and 2025. One photo is from a rural primary school, and the other is from an international private school near Copenhagen, which naturally has a different student demographic. Nationally, while there has been a slight increase in non-Western students in Danish schools (from 9.1% in 2010/2011 to 11.8% in 2023/2024), this does not support the dramatic population replacement narrative implied by the misused photos. The specific primary school in the first photo, in fact, saw a decrease in non-Western students. The dissemination of these images has also been linked to Russian propaganda. 3. Claim: The claim is that two class photos from Danish schools, taken in 2010 and 2025 (or ten years apart), show a population replacement in Denmark, with one photo showing ethnically Danish students and the other predominantly Muslim students, implying a significant demographic shift in the same school and country. Summary: The claim that two widely shared class photos from Danish schools document a population replacement in Denmark is false. The evidence clearly refutes this assertion. The photos are not from the same school or the same class; one was taken in 2010/2011 at a regular primary school in rural Randers, while the other was taken in 2017/2018 at an international private school near Copenhagen that has a higher proportion of Muslim students. This difference in school type and location naturally accounts for the difference in student composition, making the comparison misleading. Furthermore, the 2025 date claimed for the second photo is incorrect. While national statistics show a slight increase in students of non-Western background in Danish schools (from 9.1% in 2010/2011 to 11.8% in 2023/2024), this minor shift does not support the drastic population replacement narrative. In the specific primary school from the first photo, the percentage of non-Western students actually decreased to zero percent by 2023/2024. The misuse of these images has also been identified as part of Russian propaganda efforts to promote a narrative of Western decay.";1. What is the claim being evaluated? The claim is that two class photos from Danish schools, purportedly from the same school and class in 2010 and 2025 (or ten years apart), demonstrate a population replacement in Denmark, implying a significant demographic shift towards a non-Danish, specifically Muslim, majority. 2. Based on the evidence provided, is the claim true, false, mixed or another verdict category? False. 3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict? The evidence unequivocally refutes the claim. Firstly, the photos are not from the same school or the same class. The first photo (predominantly ethnically Danish students) was taken in 2010/2011 at Bjerregrav School, a regular elementary school west of Randers. The second photo (many Muslim students) was taken in 2017/2018 at an international private school near Copenhagen, not 2025 as claimed. It is not surprising that a rural primary school and an international private school near a capital city would have different student demographics. Furthermore, statistics from the Ministry of Children and Education show that while there has been a slight national increase in non-Western students in Danish schools (from 9.1% in 2010/2011 to 11.8% in 2023/2024), this does not support a population replacement narrative. In the specific case of Bjerregrav School, the percentage of non-Western students actually decreased to zero percent by 2023/2024, directly contradicting the claim. The fact-check also points to the involvement of Russian propaganda in the dissemination of these misleading images. Final Verdict: The claim that two class photos from Danish schools show a population replacement in Denmark is False. The photos are from different schools, taken in different years, and misrepresented to suggest a demographic shift that is not supported by national statistics or the specific schools involved.;No, these Danish school photos don't show 'population replacement;Verdict: False. Evidence: The key pieces of evidence that refute the claim include: The two class photos are not from the same school or class. The first photo was taken in 2010/2011 at Bjerregrav School, while the second photo was taken in 2017/2018 at an international private school near Copenhagen. The student composition at Bjerregrav School actually showed a decrease in non-Western students from 2.6% in 2010/2011 to 0% in 2023/2024, contradicting the claim of a population replacement. Nationally, the increase in non-Western students was slight, from 9.1% in 2010/2011 to 11.8% in 2023/2024. Claim: The main statement being fact-checked is that two class photos from Danish schools demonstrate a population replacement in Denmark, with the implication that the country's demographics are shifting dramatically due to immigration. Here's a cohesive summary: A viral social media claim uses two class photos from Danish schools to assert that there is a population replacement happening in Denmark, implying a significant shift in demographics due to immigration. However, a fact-check reveals that this claim is false. The evidence shows that the two photos are not from the same school or class, with one taken at Bjerregrav School in 2010/2011 and the other at an international private school near Copenhagen in 2017/2018. Furthermore, the student composition at Bjerregrav School actually contradicts the claim, with a decrease in non-Western students over the period. National statistics also show only a slight increase in non-Western students, from 9.1% to 11.8%, which does not support the dramatic narrative of population replacement. The photos were likely chosen to support a specific agenda, including promoting the theory of The Great Replacement, which has been used by pro-Russian actors to illustrate Western decay. The misuse of these photos to create concern and division has been criticized by the headmaster of Bjerregrav School, who has reported the user spreading the fake news.;Here are the answers: What is the claim being evaluated? The claim being evaluated is that two class photos from Danish schools demonstrate a population replacement in Denmark, implying a significant shift in demographics due to immigration, as suggested by the caption This is how you change a country. See the difference between 2010 and 2025 at a school in Denmark. Based on the evidence provided, is the claim true, false, mixed or another verdict category? The claim is false. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict? The evidence that supports this verdict includes: The photos are not from the same school or class, making the comparison invalid. The photos were taken in different years (2010/2011 and 2017/2018) and not in 2010 and 2025 as claimed. The student composition at Bjerregrav School (one of the schools in the photo) actually showed a decrease in non-Western students, contradicting the claim. National statistics show only a slight increase in non-Western students, which does not support the dramatic narrative of population replacement. Final Verdict: The claim that two class photos from Danish schools demonstrate a population replacement in Denmark is FALSE. The evidence reveals that the photos are not comparable, the timeline is incorrect, and the demographic trends do not support the claim of a significant population replacement. Instead, the photos appear to have been misused to create a misleading narrative, likely to promote a specific agenda or ideology.;False Claim Debunked: Danish School Photos Misused to Allege Population Replacement;1. Verdict: The claim is false. 2. Evidence: - The two class photos are not from the same class or school. The first photo is from Bjerregrav School (2010/2011), a regular elementary school in Randers, and the second is from an international private school near Copenhagen (2017/2018), not 2025. - Bjerregrav School had 2.6% non-Western students in 2010/2011, and 0% in 2023/2024, contradicting the claim of population replacement. - Nationally, non-Western students increased slightly from 9.1% in 2010/2011 to 11.8% in 2023/2024, but this does not support the exaggerated claim of a dramatic population shift. - The photos have been misused on social media, including by Russian propaganda channels, to promote a population replacement narrative, with evidence of their spread on platforms like TikTok, X, and Telegram. 3. Claim: Two class photos from Danish schools, one from 2010 and one purportedly from 2025, are presented as evidence of a population replacement in Denmark, showing a shift from ethnically Danish students to a predominantly Muslim student body in the same class, school, or city. Summary: The claim that two class photos from Danish schools demonstrate a population replacement in Denmark is false. The photos, widely shared on social media platforms like X and TikTok, are misrepresented as being from the same class, school, or city, with captions suggesting a dramatic demographic shift between 2010 and 2025. In reality, the first photo is from Bjerregrav School, a regular elementary school in Randers, taken in 2010/2011, while the second is from an international private school near Copenhagen in 2017/2018, not 2025. The student composition at Bjerregrav School shows a decrease in non-Western students (from 2.6% in 2010/2011 to 0% in 2023/2024), directly contradicting the claim. Nationally, there has been only a slight increase in non-Western students (from 9.1% to 11.8% over the same period), which does not support the narrative of a significant population replacement. The photos have been exploited by Russian propaganda and far-right groups to promote the Great Replacement theory, with evidence of their spread on platforms like Telegram and X. The misuse of these images, combined with the factual inaccuracies about their origins and context, confirms the claim is false.;1. What is the claim being evaluated? The claim is that two class photos from Danish schools, one from 2010 and one purportedly from 2025, show a population replacement in Denmark, implying a significant shift from ethnically Danish students to a predominantly Muslim student body in the same class, school, or city. 2. Based on the evidence provided, is the claim true, false, mixed, or another verdict category? The claim is false. 3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict? The claim is false because the two photos are not from the same class, school, or city. The first photo is from Bjerregrav School in Randers (2010/2011), a regular elementary school, while the second is from an international private school near Copenhagen (2017/2018), not 2025. Data from Bjerregrav School shows a decrease in non-Western students (2.6% in 2010/2011 to 0% in 2023/2024), contradicting the narrative of population replacement. Nationally, non-Western students increased slightly from 9.1% to 11.8% between 2010/2011 and 2023/2024, which does not support the exaggerated claim. The photos have been misused on social media, including by Russian propaganda, to promote a false Great Replacement narrative. Final Verdict: The claim that two class photos from Danish schools demonstrate a population replacement is false. The photos are from different schools (Bjerregrav School in Randers and an international private school near Copenhagen) and different years (2010/2011 and 2017/2018, not 2025). Evidence shows no significant demographic shift at Bjerregrav School, with non-Western students decreasing to 0% by 2023/2024, and only a modest national increase in non-Western students. The misrepresentation of these photos, amplified by social media and Russian propaganda, further undermines the claim's validity.
FC_10;Bullet point summary; Images of Danish school classes are misused in international propaganda;Two class photos from Danish schools are going around the world these months. In one class photo, which is of a 9th grader from the school year 2010;This is the fact to check: Two class photos from Danish schools, which are seen by millions of users on social media, especially abroad, are being misused as documentation that there is apparently a population replacement in Denmark.  This is how you change a country. See the difference between 2010 and 2025 at a school in Denmark, reads a caption for a post on the social media X.  “Same country, same city, same school, same class, but ten years apart,” reads another post.  The class photos have also been shared by the X-profile Radio Genoa, one of the most well-known voices critical of immigrants on the platform. The profile is followed by more than a million users. Across social media, the photos have been seen by millions of people.  But the pictures cannot be used to document that there is a population change in Denmark. They are neither the same class nor the same school, and there is also a good explanation for the difference in the student composition in the two pictures.  This also suggests that people in Russia are involved in the dissemination of the images. We will return to that part. Zero This is what the post from Radio Genoa looks like on the X platform. The post has been viewed by almost half a million users. CheckIt has chosen to blur the faces in the pictures. Different schools with different students However, it is correct that both images originate from Danish schools.  The first - with the ethnically Danish students - was taken by 9A at Bjerregrav School west of Randers in the school year 2010/2011. The school is a regular elementary school.  The second photo is also taken by a 9th grader, but from an international private school near Copenhagen that has many Muslim students. It was taken in connection with the 2017/2018 school year, according to the school's website - and is therefore not from 2025, as claimed in the posts.  It is therefore not surprising that a primary school in Randers has fewer students with a background other than Danish than an international school near Copenhagen.  Headmaster at Bjerregrav School, Marlene Ankjær, tells TjekDet that she is upset that a picture from her school is being used in misinformation.  It is very unfortunate that we are being used in a context that is intended to create concern and division. Therefore, we have of course also reported the user on Facebook who is making this form of fake news, she says.  It has not been possible for TjekDet to get a comment from the international school near Copenhagen.  But what does the development of the numbers actually look like?  The Ministry of Children and Education calculates the distribution of students in Danish schools based on cultural circles, which include the categories 'Denmark', 'Western' and 'non-Western'.  At Bjerregrav School in the 2010/2011 school year, when the photos of the 9th grade students were taken, non-Western students made up 2.6 percent. In the 2023/2024 school year, the figure is zero percent. Here, the student composition has therefore gone in the opposite direction to what the postings on X claim.  Nationally, there has been a slight increase in the number of non-Western students. In the 2023/2024 school year, students with a non-Western background made up 11.8 percent of students in the country's primary, secondary and private schools. In the 2010/2011 school year, the proportion was 9.1 percent. Checked Who are the non-Western foreigners everyone is talking about? From TikTok to Russian propaganda TjekDet has not been able to trace the first sharing of the misleading comparison between the two class photos with certainty. The earliest we have been able to find dates from April 15 on X and Instagram. On Instagram, the photos were shared by the far-right page “Europe on Top”. The post has more than 32,000 likes.  However, the text on the images reveals that they originally came from TikTok - this can be seen in the distinctive font.  In other similar posts on X, you can see that the pictures of the school classes are taken as screenshots from TikTok. At the bottom right, you can see that the post on TikTok, where the screenshot was taken, has a whopping 378,000 likes.  TjekDet has not been able to find the images on TikTok.  However, we can see that a few days later the images are being spread as Russian propaganda on Russian websites and by major channels on Telegram.  Among others, by Russian senator Alexey Pushkov, who writes about the photos:  “School class photos in Denmark in 2010 and 2025. The point of no return has been reached.” Checked How five dirty men and a 'Middle Eastern' family ended up in the same photo Another pro-Russian channel on Telegram with more than half a million followers writes about the images:  “A bit of horror. This is how the graduating classes in Denmark have changed over 15 years. If we don't stop the development, we'll soon have the same thing here.”  It is no coincidence that the images have been picked up by pro-Russian actors. The images support a theory of population replacement, which states that Danes will be outnumbered in Denmark in the future in favor of a Muslim majority.  A theory that Russia has often  promoted  because it serves as an example of Western decay for Russia, while at the same time the theory is used to create national cohesion within Russia.  Sign up for the CheckIt newsletter The theory has existed for many years, and is also known internationally as “ The Great Replacement ” - which is perhaps why the posts about schools in Denmark have been shared by so many people on social media.  This is not the first time that Danish schoolchildren have been abused to create a similar false narrative. TjekDet has previously reported how a video of students on a field trip was abused to claim that the students had converted to Islam.;Role;Photos falsely claimed to show Denmark’s population replacement are from different schools and years, misleading viewers;Claim: Two class photos from Danish schools, widely shared on social media, are being used to claim that Denmark is undergoing a population replacement, showing drastic ethnic changes in the same school class between 2010 and 2025. Evidence:  The two photos are not from the same school, class, or year. The first (2010/2011) is from 9A at Bjerregrav School near Randers, a regular elementary school with mostly ethnically Danish students.  The second (2017/2018) is from an international private school near Copenhagen with many Muslim students, not from 2025 as claimed.  At Bjerregrav School, the proportion of non-Western students actually decreased from 2.6% in 2010/11 to 0% in 2023/24, contradicting claims of population replacement at that school.  Nationally, there has been a small increase in students with non-Western backgrounds (from 9.1% in 2010/11 to 11.8% in 2023/24), but this does not support the dramatic claim implied by the photos.  The photos have been used by far-right and pro-Russian actors to promote a misleading narrative of population replacement, exploiting the images out of context. Verdict: The claim is false. The photos do not show the same school or year and cannot be used to prove population replacement in Denmark. The evidence clearly demonstrates the images are misused to spread misinformation and stoke division.;1. Claim being assessed: That two class photos from Danish schools, supposedly taken from the same school and class in 2010 and 2025, demonstrate a population replacement in Denmark due to drastic ethnic changes over time. 2. Final verdict: False. 3. Explanation: The photos are from different schools—one from a public school near Randers in 2010/2011 and the other from an international private school near Copenhagen in 2017/2018—not the same school or year. The first school’s student composition actually shows a decrease in non-Western students over time, contradicting the claim. Nationally, changes in student demographics are gradual and modest, not the dramatic shift implied. The images have been misused to promote misleading narratives, making the population replacement claim unsupported by the evidence.;Danish School Photos Falsely Used to Push Population Replacement Narrative;Claim: Two class photos from Danish schools, circulating widely on social media, especially abroad, are being misused as documentation of an alleged population replacement in Denmark, with captions claiming they show the same country, same city, same school, same class, but ten years apart (e.g., 2010 vs. 2025). Evidence:  Misleading Photo Comparison: The two photos are not from the same school or the same class, nor are they from the years claimed.  The first photo (predominantly ethnically Danish students) was taken in the 2010/2011 school year from Bjerregrav School, a regular elementary school west of Randers.  The second photo (many Muslim students) was taken in the 2017/2018 school year from an international private school near Copenhagen.  Geographic and School Type Differences: It is expected that a primary school in Randers would have fewer students with non-Danish backgrounds than an international private school near Copenhagen, which caters to a diverse student body.  Actual Demographic Data (National vs. Local):  At Bjerregrav School, the percentage of non-Western students decreased from 2.6% in 2010/2011 to 0% in 2023/2024, contradicting the claim of population replacement at that specific school.  Nationally, the proportion of non-Western students in Danish primary, secondary, and private schools increased slightly from 9.1% in the 2010/2011 school year to 11.8% in the 2023/2024 school year. This is an increase, but far from a population replacement scenario suggested by the misleading photos.  Misinformation and Foreign Involvement: The headmaster of Bjerregrav School has reported the misuse of her school's photo for misinformation. The images have been spread as Russian propaganda on Russian websites and by major Telegram channels, supporting the Great Replacement theory, which posits that Danes will be outnumbered by a Muslim majority. Verdict: False. The claim that the two class photos document a population replacement in Denmark is false. The photos are from different schools, different types of schools, and different years than claimed. While there has been a slight national increase in students with non-Western backgrounds, the overall statistics do not support the dramatic narrative of population replacement suggested by the misused images. The dissemination of these images appears to be part of a broader misinformation campaign, including Russian propaganda.;Claim Being Assessed: Two class photos from Danish schools, circulating on social media, falsely represent a population replacement in Denmark by claiming to show the same school and class over a ten to fifteen-year period (e.g., 2010 vs. 2025). Final Verdict: False. Explanation of how the evidence supports the verdict: The evidence overwhelmingly refutes the claim. The fact-check establishes that: 1. Different Schools, Different Contexts: The two photos are not from the same school or the same class. The first photo is from a regular public elementary school (Bjerregrav School) in a less diverse region, while the second is from an international private school near Copenhagen, which, by its nature, attracts a more diverse student body and, in this specific instance, has many Muslim students. 2. Incorrect Dates: The second photo, falsely claimed to be from 2025, was actually taken in the 2017/2018 school year. 3. Local vs. National Trends: While the overall national percentage of non-Western students in Danish schools has seen a slight increase (from 9.1% in 2010/2011 to 11.8% in 2023/2024), this is not indicative of a population replacement. Furthermore, the specific school in the first photo actually saw a decrease in non-Western students over the period. 4. Intentional Misinformation: The misuse of these images is a deliberate act of misinformation, recognized by the headmaster of Bjerregrav School, and has been amplified by pro-Russian propaganda channels to support the Great Replacement theory. Therefore, the visual comparison is misleading, the contextual information is incorrect, and the underlying premise of a population replacement is not supported by the demographic data.;False Claim: Danish School Photos Misused to Suggest 'Population Replacement;Claim: Two class photos from Danish schools are being used to claim that there is a population replacement in Denmark, with captions suggesting a significant change in the country's demographics between 2010 and 2025. Evidence: The photos are not from the same school or class, contrary to claims. One photo is from Bjerregrav School in Randers (2010/2011 school year), and the other is from an international private school near Copenhagen (2017/2018 school year). The headmaster of Bjerregrav School confirms the photo's origin and expresses upset over its misuse. Statistics from the Ministry of Children and Education show that the proportion of non-Western students at Bjerregrav School actually decreased from 2.6% to 0% between 2010/2011 and 2023/2024. Nationally, there was a slight increase in non-Western students from 9.1% to 11.8% during the same period. Verdict: False. The evidence shows that the photos are being misused to support a false narrative about population replacement in Denmark. The photos are not comparable, and the statistics do not support the claim of a significant demographic shift in the direction suggested by the posts. The images have been spread by pro-Russian actors and far-right pages, promoting a theory of The Great Replacement that does not reflect the actual demographic changes in Denmark. ;Claim: The claim being assessed is that two class photos from Danish schools document a population replacement in Denmark, implying a significant demographic shift between 2010 and 2025. 2. Verdict: False 3. Explanation: The evidence shows that the claim is false because: The photos are not from the same school or class, making them incomparable. The photos were taken in different years (2010/2011 and 2017/2018), not in 2010 and 2025 as claimed. The difference in student composition can be explained by the different types of schools (regular elementary school vs. international private school). Statistics from the Ministry of Children and Education show that the demographic changes in Denmark do not support the claim of a significant shift in the direction suggested by the posts. The evidence demonstrates that the photos are being misused to support a false narrative, and the claim is therefore rated as false.;False: Viral Danish School Photos Misused to Claim 'Population Replacement';Claim: Two class photos from Danish schools, one from 2010 and another allegedly from 2025, are being shared on social media to suggest a population replacement in Denmark, implying a significant increase in non-Danish students over time. The posts claim the photos are from the same country, city, school, and class, taken ten years apart. Evidence: The fact-check reveals that the photos are not from the same school or class, nor is the second photo from 2025. The first photo, from 2010/2011, is from Bjerregrav School, a regular elementary school in Randers, with 2.6% non-Western students at the time and 0% in 2023/2024. The second photo, from 2017/2018, is from an international private school near Copenhagen with many Muslim students, explaining the difference in student composition. Nationally, non-Western students increased slightly from 9.1% in 2010/2011 to 11.8% in 2023/2024, but this does not support the claim of a dramatic population replacement. The images were also spread by Russian propaganda channels, promoting a Great Replacement narrative, with early posts traced to TikTok and shared on platforms like X and Instagram. Verdict: False. The claim misrepresents the photos as being from the same school and class, taken ten years apart, to falsely suggest a significant demographic shift in Denmark. The evidence shows the photos are from different schools with different student demographics, and the second photo is not from 2025, debunking the narrative of population replacement.;Claim: Two class photos, one from 2010 and another allegedly from 2025, from the same Danish school and class, are being shared on social media to demonstrate a population replacement in Denmark, suggesting a significant increase in non-Danish students over time. Verdict: False. Explanation: The evidence shows the photos are not from the same school or class, nor is the second photo from 2025. The 2010/2011 photo is from Bjerregrav School in Randers, a regular elementary school with 2.6% non-Western students at the time, dropping to 0% by 2023/2024. The second photo, from 2017/2018, is from an international private school near Copenhagen with many Muslim students, explaining the differing student composition. Nationally, non-Western students increased slightly from 9.1% in 2010/2011 to 11.8% in 2023/2024, which does not support the dramatic population replacement narrative. The misrepresentation of the photos' context and timeline, combined with their use in misleading social media posts, confirms the claim is false.

It was taken in connection with the 2017/2018 school year, according to the school's website - and is therefore not from 2025, as claimed in the posts.  It is therefore not surprising that a primary school in Randers has fewer students with a background other than Danish than an international school near Copenhagen.  Headmaster at Bjerregrav School, Marlene Ankjær, tells TjekDet that she is upset that a picture from her school is being used in misinformation.  It is very unfortunate that we are being used in a context that is intended to create concern and division. Therefore, we have of course also reported the user on Facebook who is making this form of fake news, she says.  It has not been possible for TjekDet to get a comment from the international school near Copenhagen.  But what does the development of the numbers actually look like?  The Ministry of Children and Education calculates the distribution of students in Danish schools based on cultural circles, which include the categories 'Denmark', 'Western' and 'non-Western'.  At Bjerregrav School in the 2010/2011 school year, when the photos of the 9th grade students were taken, non-Western students made up 2.6 percent. In the 2023/2024 school year, the figure is zero percent. Here, the student composition has therefore gone in the opposite direction to what the postings on X claim.  Nationally, there has been a slight increase in the number of non-Western students. In the 2023/2024 school year, students with a non-Western background made up 11.8 percent of students in the country's primary, secondary and private schools. In the 2010/2011 school year, the proportion was 9.1 percent. Checked Who are the non-Western foreigners everyone is talking about? From TikTok to Russian propaganda TjekDet has not been able to trace the first sharing of the misleading comparison between the two class photos with certainty. The earliest we have been able to find dates from April 15 on X and Instagram. On Instagram, the photos were shared by the far-right page “Europe on Top”. The post has more than 32,000 likes.  However, the text on the images reveals that they originally came from TikTok - this can be seen in the distinctive font.  In other similar posts on X, you can see that the pictures of the school classes are taken as screenshots from TikTok. At the bottom right, you can see that the post on TikTok, where the screenshot was taken, has a whopping 378,000 likes.  TjekDet has not been able to find the images on TikTok.  However, we can see that a few days later the images are being spread as Russian propaganda on Russian websites and by major channels on Telegram.  Among others, by Russian senator Alexey Pushkov, who writes about the photos:  “School class photos in Denmark in 2010 and 2025. The point of no return has been reached.” Checked How five dirty men and a 'Middle Eastern' family ended up in the same photo Another pro-Russian channel on Telegram with more than half a million followers writes about the images:  “A bit of horror. This is how the graduating classes in Denmark have changed over 15 years. If we don't stop the development, we'll soon have the same thing here.”  It is no coincidence that the images have been picked up by pro-Russian actors. The images support a theory of population replacement, which states that Danes will be outnumbered in Denmark in the future in favor of a Muslim majority.  A theory that Russia has often  promoted  because it serves as an example of Western decay for Russia, while at the same time the theory is used to create national cohesion within Russia.  Sign up for the CheckIt newsletter The theory has existed for many years, and is also known internationally as “ The Great Replacement ” - which is perhaps why the posts about schools in Denmark have been shared by so many people on social media.  This is not the first time that Danish schoolchildren have been abused to create a similar false narrative. TjekDet has previously reported how a video of students on a field trip was abused to claim that the students had converted to Islam.;Zero-shot;Misleading Photos Falsely Claim Population Replacement in Denmark — Schools Are Different and Years Don’t Match;Claim being evaluated: Two class photos from Danish schools, shared widely on social media, are used to falsely claim that Denmark is experiencing a rapid population replacement, showing the same school class in 2010 and 2025 with drastically different ethnic compositions. Key evidence used to assess the claim:  The photos are from different schools and different years: the first photo is from a 9th-grade class at Bjerregrav School (a regular elementary school in Randers) in 2010/2011, and the second is from a 9th-grade class at an international private school near Copenhagen in 2017/2018, not 2025.  The schools have very different student demographics, explaining the difference in ethnic composition.  Data from the Ministry of Children and Education shows no evidence of a population replacement at Bjerregrav School, where the proportion of non-Western students actually decreased between 2010 and 2024.  Nationally, there has only been a slight increase in students with a non-Western background from 9.1% in 2010/2011 to 11.8% in 2023/2024, far from the dramatic change suggested.  The images have been used by far-right and pro-Russian sources to promote the Great Replacement conspiracy theory, often to create division or support propaganda.  The headmaster of the first school expressed concern over the misuse of the photo. Verdict: False. The photos do not show the same class or school, are from different years, and do not support the claim of a rapid population replacement in Denmark. The comparison is misleading and used to spread misinformation and divisive narratives.;"1. Claim being evaluated: That two class photos from Danish schools—purportedly from the same school and class in 2010 and 2025—show a dramatic population replacement in Denmark, illustrating a shift toward a Muslim majority. 2. Verdict: False. 3. Explanation: The photos are from different schools and different years (2010/2011 and 2017/2018), not the same class or school in 2010 and 2025 as claimed. The difference in student composition is explained by the distinct nature and location of the schools. Official data shows no evidence of a rapid population replacement in Denmark; demographic changes are modest and gradual nationally and even show a decline in non-Western students at the school featured in the first photo. The images have been misused to spread misinformation and support divisive conspiracy theories.";False: Viral Danish School Photos Don't Show Population Replacement, Misrepresent Schools and Dates;The claim being evaluated is that two class photos from Danish schools, circulating widely on social media, document a population replacement in Denmark, with captions suggesting they show the same school and class in 2010 and 2025 (or ten years apart). The key evidence used to assess the claim is:  Photo Origin: The first photo (primarily ethnically Danish students) is from Bjerregrav School in Randers, taken in 2010/2011. The second photo (many Muslim students) is from an international private school near Copenhagen, taken in 2017/2018, not 2025.  School Type: The photos are from different types of schools: a regular elementary school in a less diverse area versus an international private school, which naturally attracts a more diverse student body.  Local School Data: At Bjerregrav School, the percentage of non-Western students decreased from 2.6% in 2010/2011 to 0% in 2023/2024, contradicting the claim of increasing diversity.  National Student Demographics: Nationally, the proportion of non-Western students in Danish primary, secondary, and private schools increased slightly from 9.1% in 2010/2011 to 11.8% in 2023/2024.  Misinformation Campaign: The images are being intentionally misused, with evidence suggesting involvement from pro-Russian actors and far-right social media pages to promote the Great Replacement theory. Based on this evidence, the verdict is False. The photos do not depict the same school or class, are not from the years claimed in the misleading posts, and are being deliberately used to spread misinformation about population replacement in Denmark.;1. What is the claim being evaluated? The claim being evaluated is that two widely circulated class photos from Danish schools demonstrate a population replacement in Denmark, specifically suggesting they show the same country, same city, same school, same class ten to fifteen years apart (e.g., 2010 vs. 2025). 2. Is the claim true, false, or mixed or other relevant category of verdict? False. 3. Provide a brief explanation for your decision based on the evidence presented in the fact-check. The claim is false because the two photos are neither from the same school nor the same class. The first photo is from a regular elementary school in Randers (2010/2011), while the second is from an international private school near Copenhagen (2017/2018) which naturally has a more diverse student body. Furthermore, the 2025 date claimed for the second photo is incorrect. Data from the first school even shows a decrease in non-Western students, contradicting the replacement narrative. The images are being intentionally misused to spread misinformation, including by pro-Russian actors.;Claim of Danish Population Replacement Through School Photos is False;Claim: Two class photos from Danish schools, one from 2010 and one from 2025, show a population replacement in Denmark, with the latter photo featuring mostly Muslim students. Key Evidence: Investigation revealed that the two photos are not from the same school or class. The first photo was taken in 2010/2011 at Bjerregrav School in Randers, while the second photo was taken in 2017/2018 at an international private school near Copenhagen with many Muslim students. The headmaster of Bjerregrav School confirmed the photo's origin and expressed upset over its misuse. Statistics from the Ministry of Children and Education showed that the proportion of non-Western students at Bjerregrav School actually decreased from 2.6% to 0% between 2010/2011 and 2023/2024. Nationally, the proportion of non-Western students increased slightly from 9.1% to 11.8% during the same period. Verdict: False. The claim is based on a misleading comparison of two unrelated photos, and the statistics do not support the narrative of a population replacement in Denmark. The photos have been spread by pro-Russian actors to promote a theory of Western decay.;Here's the verdict: Claim: The claim being evaluated is that two class photos from Danish schools, one from 2010 and one from 2025, document a population replacement in Denmark, implying a significant shift in the demographic composition of the country. Verdict: False Explanation: The claim is false because the two photos are not from the same school or class, and the dates and contexts are different. The photo labeled as being from 2025 was actually taken in 2017/2018 at an international private school near Copenhagen with many Muslim students, while the other photo was taken in 2010/2011 at a regular elementary school in Randers. Furthermore, statistics from the Ministry of Children and Education show that the specific school in Randers did not experience an increase in non-Western students, contradicting the narrative of population replacement. The photos have been misused to promote a misleading narrative, likely as part of a larger disinformation campaign.;False: Viral Danish School Photos Misused to Claim 'Population Replacement'—Images Not from Same School or Year;Claim: Two class photos from Danish schools, one from 2010 and one from 2025, are being shared on social media to suggest a population replacement in Denmark, implying a significant increase in non-Danish students over time. Key Evidence: - The first photo, from 2010/2011, is from Bjerregrav School, a regular elementary school in Randers, with mostly ethnically Danish students. - The second photo, claimed to be from 2025, is actually from 2017/2018 and comes from an international private school near Copenhagen with many Muslim students, not the same school or class as the first photo. - At Bjerregrav School, non-Western students decreased from 2.6% in 2010/2011 to 0% in 2023/2024, contradicting the claim of population replacement. - Nationally, non-Western students increased slightly from 9.1% in 2010/2011 to 11.8% in 2023/2024, but this does not support the exaggerated narrative of replacement. - The photos were shared on platforms like X, Instagram, and TikTok, with some posts linked to Russian propaganda promoting the Great Replacement theory. Verdict: False. The photos do not depict the same school or class, and the claimed timeline (2010 vs. 2025) is incorrect. The narrative of population replacement is misleading, as data shows no significant demographic shift at Bjerregrav School and only a modest national increase in non-Western students.;1. Claim Being Evaluated: Two class photos from Danish schools, one from 2010 and one from 2025, are being shared on social media to suggest a population replacement in Denmark, implying a significant increase in non-Danish students over time. 2. Verdict: False. 3. Explanation: The claim is false because the photos do not represent the same school or class, and the timeline is inaccurate (the second photo is from 2017/2018, not 2025). Data from Bjerregrav School shows a decrease in non-Western students from 2.6% in 2010/2011 to 0% in 2023/2024, contradicting the narrative. Nationally, non-Western students increased slightly from 9.1% to 11.8% over the same period, but this does not support the exaggerated population replacement claim. The photos’ misuse, including by Russian propaganda, further undermines their validity as evidence.
FC_11;Bullet point summary;Has your Big Mac gotten significantly smaller since the 1980s?; Several viral posts on social media claim that the McDonald's Big Mac has shrunk by 40 percent since 1980.      A picture of a Big Mac, supposedly from the 1980s, is used as documentation.      But TjekDets research shows that there is no indication that the popular burger has shrunk in recent decades. ;This is the fact to chek: A sure winner among hangover-stricken Danes on January 1st is McDonalds - and many probably swear by one of their signature burgers - the Big Mac. But would you have been fuller if you had sunk your teeth into a Big Mac back in the 1980s? At least that's what several posts on Facebook claim, which are currently being seen by thousands of users. The posts claim that the burger has shrunk significantly in size , while at the same time increasing significantly in price . The claim is widespread in both Danish and English Facebook posts . One of the English posts has 29,000 shares , while another has been shared more than 9,000 times . Some of the posts claim that the burger has become 40 percent smaller . As documentation, many of the posts use the same image, which shows two Big Macs. One is supposedly from the 1980s, while the other is from 2024. If the image is to be believed, then there is a significant size difference. This image is repeated in numerous posts, where it is claimed that McDonald's Big Mac has shrunk significantly since the happy 80s (Photo: Screenshot of Facebook). But while it might take two Big Macs to cure your hangover today, it wouldn't have been any different in the 1980s According to TjekDet's research, there is no indication that the Big Mac has shrunk since the 1980s. However, it has increased in price - although not very much if you take inflation into account. The price increase According to an article from the Pennsylvania Center for the Book, the Big Mac was first introduced in the 1960s by Jim Delligatti, who owned a number of McDonald's restaurants in Pittsburgh, USA. In 1968, the Big Mac was added to the menu at all McDonald's restaurants in the United States. And the price? It was 45 cents. If you use an inflation converter to calculate what 45 cents in 1968 is worth today, the answer is just over $4. Today, a Big Mac in the USA costs $5.69 - equivalent to just over 40 Danish kroner, while the normal price in Denmark is 39 kroner for one of the popular burgers. From country to country, there is virtually no difference in what a Big Mac looks like. That is why the media outlet “The Economist” has published  the “Big Mac Index” since 1986 as a way to compare price levels across borders and currencies. In 2024,  “The Economist” has calculated that Switzerland will have the world's most expensive Big Mac with a price of $8.17 - equivalent to about 58 Danish kroner. But what about the size? The price is one thing, but what happened to the size of the Big Mac? Some of the posts on social media claim that the burger has become 40 percent smaller since 1980. If you ask McDonald's press department in Denmark, they flatly deny that the Big Mac has changed size. “The size of Big Mac's has not changed since McDonald's came to Denmark in 1981. We are not allowed to do that at all,” says Mads Jensen, a communications officer at McDonald's. Today, McDonald's Danish website states that a Big Mac contains 510 calories. If you look at the American version , it contains 590 calories. But on neither the Danish nor the American website can you see how much a Big Mac weighs. Therefore, TjekDet bought three Big Mac's at three different McDonald's restaurants in Copenhagen and here the weight was 200 grams, 206 grams and 222 grams. By using the Wayback Machine, which is an internet archiving tool, TjekDet has managed to find the content description for a Big Mac in Denmark back in 2001 . Back then, a Big Mac weighed 209 grams and contained 2137 kJ, which corresponds to 511 calories. In terms of both weight and calories, the Big Mac is basically the same today as it was more than 20 years ago, so you shouldn't feel cheated when you sink your teeth into a Big Mac in 2025. However, the number of calories has varied a little. In 2019, McDonald's website stated that there were 503 calories in a Big Mac, while in 2022 there were 487 calories - and as previously mentioned - today there are 510 calories in one of the popular burgers.  In 2020, McDonald's in Denmark had a turnover of 2.7 billion kroner, McDonald's writes on its own website. Photo: Shutterstock More calories in Everything is bigger in the USA sounds like a cool phrase, but when it comes to Big Macs, there isn't much difference between Denmark and the USA. For Big Macs in the US, there are significantly more content designations to dig up than in recent decades, and there is nothing to suggest that the Big Mac has shrunk in size. The biggest difference from Denmark is the number of calories, which is generally higher in the US than in Denmark. In 1996 we can see that there were 530 calories in an American Big Mac , so there are actually more calories in the burger in 2025 than back then - namely 590 calories. In 2003, we can see that the burger weighed 216 grams, which is roughly consistent with the results that TjekDet obtained. Even though we can't go back any further than 1996 for the USA and 2001 for Denmark, there is no documentation that the popular burger has become smaller.;Vanilla;No, the Big Mac Has Not Shrunk Since the 1980s – Viral Claim Is False;Big Mac size has not shrunk: Despite viral social media claims and images suggesting otherwise, there is no evidence that the Big Mac has become smaller since the 1980s. Weight and calorie data from both Denmark and the U.S. show consistent size over time.  Price has increased, but inflation-adjusted: While the price of a Big Mac has risen since its introduction, the increase is modest when adjusted for inflation. For example, the 1968 price of 45 cents in the U.S. equates to just over \$4 today, compared to the current price of \$5.69.  Calorie count varies slightly: The Big Mac's calorie content has fluctuated slightly over the years but remains in the same general range, with no major size reduction implied by these changes.;Verdict: False The claim that the Big Mac has shrunk significantly in size since the 1980s is not supported by evidence. Research shows that the burger’s weight and calorie content have remained largely consistent over the years. While the price has increased, it aligns reasonably with inflation. Therefore, the claim circulating on social media is false.;Claims of Shrunken Big Macs Since the 80s Are False;Size: There is no evidence to suggest that the McDonald's Big Mac has shrunk significantly in size since the 1980s. McDonald's Denmark denies any change in size, and historical data from Denmark (2001) and the USA (2003) for Big Mac weight and calories are consistent with current figures.  Price: The price of a Big Mac has increased over time. However, when accounting for inflation, the price increase from 1968 to today is not as substantial as some claims might suggest.  Calories: While there have been minor fluctuations in the calorie count over the years (both in Denmark and the USA), the overall calorie content of the Big Mac remains largely consistent with what it was decades ago. In fact, the US Big Mac currently has more calories (590) than it did in 1996 (530).;Based on the provided fact-check, the verdict is False. The claim that the Big Mac has shrunk significantly in size is directly contradicted by the research, while the claim of a significant price increase is tempered by inflation considerations.;Fact-Check: No, McDonald's Big Mac Hasn't Shrunk Significantly in Size Since the 1980s;The claim that McDonald's Big Mac has shrunk significantly in size since the 1980s is false. The size and weight of the Big Mac have remained largely the same, with research and measurements showing minimal variation over the years. While the price of a Big Mac has increased, it's not drastic when adjusted for inflation, with a Big Mac costing $5.69 in the US today compared to 45 cents in 1968 (equivalent to around $4 today). Meta AI response: Here's a summary: The claim that McDonald's Big Mac has shrunk significantly in size since the 1980s is false. The size and weight of the Big Mac have remained largely the same, with research and measurements showing minimal variation over the years. While the price of a Big Mac has increased, it's not drastic when adjusted for inflation, with a Big Mac costing $5.69 in the US today compared to 45 cents in 1968 (equivalent to around $4 today).;Verdict: FALSE The claim that McDonald's Big Mac has shrunk significantly in size since the 1980s is not supported by evidence, and McDonald's has confirmed that the size has remained the same.;Big Mac Size Myths Busted: No Shrinkage Since the 1980s, Fact-Check Confirms;Size Consistency: Investigations by TjekDet and McDonald's Denmark confirm that the Big Mac has not shrunk since the 1980s, with weights in 2024 (200–222 grams) aligning closely with 2001 data (209 grams), debunking social media claims of a 40% size reduction. - Price Increase: The Big Mac's price has risen since its 1968 introduction at 45 cents (about $4 today after inflation) to $5.69 in the USA and 39 kroner in Denmark in 2024, but the increase is moderate when adjusted for inflation. - Calorie Variations: Calorie content has slightly fluctuated, with Denmark's Big Mac at 510 calories in 2024 (compared to 503 in 2019 and 487 in 2022) and the USA's at 590 calories (up from 530 in 1996), but no significant size reduction is evident.;The claim that the Big Mac has shrunk significantly in size since the 1980s is false. Evidence from TjekDet's investigation, McDonald's Denmark, and historical data (e.g., 209 grams in 2001 vs. 200–222 grams in 2024) shows no significant size reduction. While the price has increased, this is largely consistent with inflation, and calorie counts have slightly varied but do not support claims of a smaller burger.

Main evidence used:  Direct statement from McDonald’s Denmark denying any size reduction.  Historical data from the Wayback Machine showing consistent weight and calorie content of Big Macs from 2001 to 2025 in Denmark.  U.S. data from 1996 and 2003 also shows no significant reduction in weight or calories.  TjekDet’s own 2024 measurements of Big Macs in Copenhagen confirm current weights (200–222 grams) align with past data.  Verdict: False The claim that Big Macs have shrunk since the 1980s is not supported by available data. Both calorie content and weight have remained largely consistent over time, and no credible evidence supports a 40% reduction in size. The price has increased, but in line with inflation.;Verdict of the Fact-Check: 1. What is the claim being verified? That the McDonald’s Big Mac has significantly shrunk in size—by up to 40%—since the 1980s, while its price has increased. 2. What is the final verdict? False 3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict?  McDonald’s Denmark confirmed the Big Mac size has not changed since its 1981 launch in the country.  Independent weight measurements in 2024 (200–222 grams) closely match a documented 209-gram weight from 2001.  Calorie counts from the past (2001–2025) show only minor variations, indicating stable portion sizes.  U.S. data from 1996 and 2003 also show similar weight and calorie figures to today's, disproving the claim of a significant size reduction.;Big Mac Hasn't Shrunk, But Price Rise Is Modest When Accounting for Inflation;Claim Being Verified: The central claim being verified is that McDonald's Big Mac burger has significantly shrunk in size (some posts claim up to 40% smaller) since the 1980s, while simultaneously increasing significantly in price. This is often supported by an image showing two Big Macs, one supposedly from the 1980s and one from 2024.  Main Evidence Used to Refute Claim:  Size: McDonald's Denmark press department explicitly denies any change in Big Mac size since their establishment in 1981, stating they are not allowed to do that at all. TjekDet's own research from 2001 (using the Wayback Machine) shows a Big Mac weighing 209 grams, which is consistent with their current findings (200-222 grams). Calorie counts have also remained largely stable, with 510 calories currently in Denmark and 590 in the USA (with 530 calories in the USA in 1996, indicating a slight increase, not decrease).  Price: While the price has increased, the fact-check shows that a 1968 price of 45 cents, when adjusted for inflation, is just over $4 today. The current price in the USA is $5.69 and in Denmark is 39 kroner, indicating an increase, but not a drastic one when inflation is considered.  Verdict and Key Reasons: The verdict is False regarding the size claim, and Mixed/Nuanced for the price claim.  Size: There is no evidence to support the claim that the Big Mac has shrunk. McDonald's denies it, and historical weight and calorie data align closely with current figures. The visual documentation provided in social media posts is not supported by facts.  Price: The Big Mac has indeed increased in nominal price, but when accounting for inflation, the increase is not as significant as suggested by the social media claims.;Here's the verdict of the fact-check: 1. What is the claim being verified? The claim being verified is that McDonald's Big Mac has significantly shrunk in size (some claiming by 40%) since the 1980s, while its price has also increased significantly. This claim is often accompanied by an image comparing two Big Macs, one supposedly from the 1980s and one from 2024. 2. What is the final verdict (True/False/Mixed)? The verdict is False regarding the claim that the Big Mac has shrunk in size. The verdict is Mixed regarding the claim of a significant price increase, as the price has risen, but not as drastically when adjusted for inflation. 3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict?  Size: McDonald's Denmark explicitly denies any change in the Big Mac's size since 1981, stating they are not allowed to do that at all. Historical data from 2001 (Denmark) shows a Big Mac weighing 209 grams and containing 511 calories, which is consistent with current measurements (200-222 grams and 510 calories). For the USA, 1996 data shows 530 calories, and today it's 590 calories, indicating a slight increase in calories, not a decrease in size. While anecdotal claims of smaller burgers persist on social media, official company statements and historical nutritional data refute the claim of a significant size reduction.  Price: The Big Mac's price has indeed increased. For instance, in 1968, it cost 45 cents in the USA, which is equivalent to just over $4 today when adjusted for inflation. The current price in the USA is $5.69, and in Denmark, it's 39 kroner. While there's an increase, the inflation-adjusted figures show it's not a significant increase beyond general price rises, as implied by the social media claims.;Big Mac Not Shrinking: Fact-Check Finds No Evidence of Size Change;Claim being verified: The claim being fact-checked is that the Big Mac has shrunk significantly in size over the years, with some posts claiming it has become 40% smaller, while its price has increased. Main evidence used: The main evidence used to refute this claim includes statements from McDonald's press department in Denmark, archived content descriptions from McDonald's websites in Denmark and the US, and physical weight measurements of Big Macs purchased from different McDonald's restaurants in Copenhagen. Additionally, the fact-checkers used the Wayback Machine to verify the consistency of the Big Mac's content over the years. Verdict: The verdict is FALSE. The key reasons behind this verdict are that McDonald's has consistently stated that the size of the Big Mac has not changed, and the fact-checkers found no evidence to contradict this claim. The weight and calorie content of the Big Mac have remained largely consistent over the years, with some minor variations in calorie content. While the price of the Big Mac has increased, this is largely in line with inflation.;Here are the answers: Claim being verified: The claim being verified is that the Big Mac has shrunk significantly in size over the years, particularly the claim that it has become 40% smaller. Final verdict: FALSE Evidence or reasoning: The evidence that supports this verdict includes: Statements from McDonald's press department in Denmark confirming that the size of the Big Mac has not changed since 1981. Archived content descriptions from McDonald's websites in Denmark (from 2001) and the US (from 1996 and 2003) showing consistent weight and calorie content. Physical weight measurements of Big Macs purchased from different McDonald's restaurants in Copenhagen, which were consistent with the archived content descriptions. The fact that the calorie content has varied slightly over the years, but not in a way that suggests a significant reduction in size. While the price of the Big Mac has increased, this is largely in line with inflation, and not evidence of a size reduction.;No Shrinkage Here: McDonald's Big Mac Size Unchanged Since 1980s, Despite Social Media Claims;"Claim being verified: Social media posts claim that McDonald's Big Mac has shrunk significantly in size (by up to 40%) since the 1980s while increasing in price, supported by an image comparing a supposed 1980s Big Mac to a 2024 version. - Main evidence: TjekDet's investigation found no evidence of size reduction, with Big Macs in Denmark weighing 200–222 grams in 2024, compared to 209 grams in 2001 (per Wayback Machine data).

Price increases align with inflation (e.g., 45 cents in 1968 is ~$4 today, vs. $5.69 in 2024). - Verdict: False. The claim of a significant size reduction is unsupported; Big Mac size and weight remain consistent with historical data. Minor calorie variations exist, but no evidence suggests a 40% size decrease. Price increases are largely explained by inflation.";1.

FC_11;Bullet point summary;Has your Big Mac gotten significantly smaller since the 1980s?; Several viral posts on social media claim that the McDonald's Big Mac has shrunk by 40 percent since 1980.      A picture of a Big Mac, supposedly from the 1980s, is used as documentation.      But TjekDets research shows that there is no indication that the popular burger has shrunk in recent decades. ;This is the fact to chek: A sure winner among hangover-stricken Danes on January 1st is McDonalds - and many probably swear by one of their signature burgers - the Big Mac. But would you have been fuller if you had sunk your teeth into a Big Mac back in the 1980s? At least that's what several posts on Facebook claim, which are currently being seen by thousands of users. The posts claim that the burger has shrunk significantly in size , while at the same time increasing significantly in price . The claim is widespread in both Danish and English Facebook posts . One of the English posts has 29,000 shares , while another has been shared more than 9,000 times . Some of the posts claim that the burger has become 40 percent smaller . As documentation, many of the posts use the same image, which shows two Big Macs. One is supposedly from the 1980s, while the other is from 2024. If the image is to be believed, then there is a significant size difference. This image is repeated in numerous posts, where it is claimed that McDonald's Big Mac has shrunk significantly since the happy 80s (Photo: Screenshot of Facebook). But while it might take two Big Macs to cure your hangover today, it wouldn't have been any different in the 1980s According to TjekDet's research, there is no indication that the Big Mac has shrunk since the 1980s. However, it has increased in price - although not very much if you take inflation into account. The price increase According to an article from the Pennsylvania Center for the Book, the Big Mac was first introduced in the 1960s by Jim Delligatti, who owned a number of McDonald's restaurants in Pittsburgh, USA. In 1968, the Big Mac was added to the menu at all McDonald's restaurants in the United States. And the price? It was 45 cents. If you use an inflation converter to calculate what 45 cents in 1968 is worth today, the answer is just over $4. Today, a Big Mac in the USA costs $5.69 - equivalent to just over 40 Danish kroner, while the normal price in Denmark is 39 kroner for one of the popular burgers. From country to country, there is virtually no difference in what a Big Mac looks like. That is why the media outlet “The Economist” has published  the “Big Mac Index” since 1986 as a way to compare price levels across borders and currencies. In 2024,  “The Economist” has calculated that Switzerland will have the world's most expensive Big Mac with a price of $8.17 - equivalent to about 58 Danish kroner. But what about the size? The price is one thing, but what happened to the size of the Big Mac? Some of the posts on social media claim that the burger has become 40 percent smaller since 1980. If you ask McDonald's press department in Denmark, they flatly deny that the Big Mac has changed size. “The size of Big Mac's has not changed since McDonald's came to Denmark in 1981. We are not allowed to do that at all,” says Mads Jensen, a communications officer at McDonald's. Today, McDonald's Danish website states that a Big Mac contains 510 calories. If you look at the American version , it contains 590 calories. But on neither the Danish nor the American website can you see how much a Big Mac weighs. Therefore, TjekDet bought three Big Mac's at three different McDonald's restaurants in Copenhagen and here the weight was 200 grams, 206 grams and 222 grams. By using the Wayback Machine, which is an internet archiving tool, TjekDet has managed to find the content description for a Big Mac in Denmark back in 2001 . Back then, a Big Mac weighed 209 grams and contained 2137 kJ, which corresponds to 511 calories. In terms of both weight and calories, the Big Mac is basically the same today as it was more than 20 years ago, so you shouldn't feel cheated when you sink your teeth into a Big Mac in 2025. However, the number of calories has varied a little. In 2019, McDonald's website stated that there were 503 calories in a Big Mac, while in 2022 there were 487 calories - and as previously mentioned - today there are 510 calories in one of the popular burgers.  In 2020, McDonald's in Denmark had a turnover of 2.7 billion kroner, McDonald's writes on its own website. Photo: Shutterstock More calories in Everything is bigger in the USA sounds like a cool phrase, but when it comes to Big Macs, there isn't much difference between Denmark and the USA. For Big Macs in the US, there are significantly more content designations to dig up than in recent decades, and there is nothing to suggest that the Big Mac has shrunk in size. The biggest difference from Denmark is the number of calories, which is generally higher in the US than in Denmark. In 1996 we can see that there were 530 calories in an American Big Mac , so there are actually more calories in the burger in 2025 than back then - namely 590 calories. In 2003, we can see that the burger weighed 216 grams, which is roughly consistent with the results that TjekDet obtained. Even though we can't go back any further than 1996 for the USA and 2001 for Denmark, there is no documentation that the popular burger has become smaller.;Chain-of-Thought;No, the Big Mac Has Not Shrunk Since the 1980s – Viral Claim Is False;Claim Being Evaluated: Social media posts, widely shared in both Danish and English, claim that the McDonald's Big Mac has shrunk significantly—by as much as 40%—since the 1980s, while also becoming more expensive.  Evidence Assessed: TjekDet investigated historical data, calorie counts, and actual burger weights. They purchased Big Macs from three locations in Copenhagen (weighing 200–222g) and found that this aligns closely with a 209g weight from 2001. Calorie content has fluctuated slightly over the years but remains consistent overall. McDonald’s Denmark also denies any reduction in size, stating such changes are not allowed.  Verdict: False. There is no documented evidence that the Big Mac has shrunk in size since the 1980s. Weight and calorie data from both Denmark and the U.S. over the past two decades support this conclusion, and claims based on viral comparison images are not substantiated.;Verdict: False 1. Claim Being Evaluated: The claim is that the McDonald’s Big Mac has shrunk significantly—by up to 40%—in size since the 1980s, while also increasing in price. 2. Key Evidence Reviewed:  TjekDet analyzed historical calorie and weight data for Big Macs in both Denmark and the U.S.  In Denmark, Big Macs weighed around 209g in 2001 and between 200g and 222g in 2024, showing no significant change.  Calorie content has remained stable over the years (e.g., 511 calories in 2001 vs. 510 in 2024).  McDonald's Denmark officially denies any reduction in size, stating that changes to product size are not allowed.  Viral images used in Facebook posts are not supported by credible or verifiable data. 3. Justification for Verdict: The available data on both weight and calories show that the Big Mac has remained consistent in size over the last 20–30 years. No credible evidence supports a 40% reduction in size. Therefore, the claim that the Big Mac has shrunk significantly since the 1980s is false.;No Shrinkage Here: Big Mac Size Claims Are False, Price Hikes Mostly Inflation;Claim: Several Facebook posts allege that McDonald's Big Mac burger has significantly shrunk in size (some claiming up to 40% smaller) since the 1980s, while its price has drastically increased. An image comparing a supposed 1980s Big Mac to a 2024 version is often used as documentation.  Evidence: TjekDet's research, including direct denial from McDonald's Denmark, shows no indication of a Big Mac size change since 1981 (when it arrived in Denmark). A Big Mac in Denmark weighed 209 grams and contained 511 calories in 2001, which is consistent with current measurements (200-222 grams, 510 calories). For the US, data from 1996 shows 530 calories, increasing to 590 calories today, and a 2003 weight of 216 grams is similar to current Danish findings. While the price has increased, when adjusted for inflation, the 1968 US price of 45 cents is equivalent to just over $4 today, compared to the current US price of $5.69.  Verdict: The claim that the Big Mac has significantly shrunk in size is false. There is no evidence to support this. While the price has increased, it's not a drastic jump when considering inflation.;Verdict: False Justification: The claim that McDonald's Big Mac has significantly shrunk in size since the 1980s is false. Evidence from McDonald's press department in Denmark explicitly states that the size of the Big Mac has not changed since its introduction in Denmark in 1981. Furthermore, historical data obtained through the Wayback Machine and current measurements corroborate this. In 2001, a Danish Big Mac weighed 209 grams and contained 511 calories, which is largely consistent with current weights (200-222 grams) and calorie content (510 calories). For the US, data from 1996 and 2003 also indicates similar weights and even a slight increase in calorie count (from 530 in 1996 to 590 today). While the price of the Big Mac has increased over time, the fact-check demonstrates that this increase is largely in line with inflation, making the claim of a significant price surge without considering inflation also misleading. The image used in social media posts to document the size difference is therefore not accurate.;Fact-check: Claim that Big Mac Has Shrunk Significantly in Size Since 1980s is FALSE;Claim: Several Facebook posts claim that McDonald's Big Mac has shrunk significantly in size since the 1980s while increasing in price. Some posts even claim the burger has become 40% smaller. Evidence: The fact-check examines the size and weight of Big Macs in Denmark and the US, using data from McDonald's press department, the Wayback Machine, and direct measurements. According to McDonald's, the size of the Big Mac has not changed since 1981 in Denmark. Measurements from 2001 and 2024 show similar weights (209g vs 200-222g) and calories (511 vs 510). In the US, data from 1996 and 2003 also show consistent calorie counts and weights. Verdict: There is no indication that the Big Mac has shrunk in size since the 1980s. While prices have increased, it's not significant when adjusted for inflation. The fact-check concludes that the Big Mac's size and calorie count have remained largely consistent over the years, debunking the claim of a significant size reduction.;Verdict: FALSE The claim being evaluated is that McDonald's Big Mac has shrunk significantly in size since the 1980s. After reviewing the evidence, it's clear that this claim is false. Here's why: McDonald's press department in Denmark confirms that the size of the Big Mac has not changed since 1981. Measurements of Big Macs in Denmark from 2001 and 2024 show similar weights (209g vs 200-222g) and calories (511 vs 510). Data from the US also shows consistent calorie counts and weights from 1996 and 2003. While prices have increased, it's not significant when adjusted for inflation. Given the consistent measurements and McDonald's confirmation, there's no evidence to support the claim that the Big Mac has shrunk significantly in size. Therefore, the claim is rated FALSE.;o Shrinkage: McDonald's Big Mac Size Remains Unchanged Since 1980s, Despite Social Media Claims;Claim: Social media posts, widely shared on Facebook, assert that McDonald's Big Mac has shrunk significantly in size since the 1980s, with some claiming a 40% reduction, while also increasing in price. The claim is supported by an image comparing a supposed 1980s Big Mac to one from 2024, showing a notable size difference. - Evidence: TjekDet's investigation found no evidence supporting the size reduction claim. McDonald's Denmark confirmed that the Big Mac's size has remained unchanged since 1981. Measurements from three Big Macs in Copenhagen (200g, 206g, 222g) align with a 2001 archived record of 209g and 511 calories, similar to today's 510 calories in Denmark and 590 in the US. Historical US data from 1996 (530 calories) and 2003 (216g) also show consistency. While prices have risen (from 45 cents in 1968 to $5.69 in the US and 39 kroner in Denmark in 2024), inflation accounts for most of the increase. - Verdict: The claim that the Big Mac has shrunk significantly since the 1980s is false. Evidence from McDonald's, current and historical weight/calorie data, and TjekDet's measurements confirm the burger's size has remained consistent. The price increase is largely explained by inflation, and the widely shared image lacks credible documentation to support the size reduction claim.;Verdict: The claim that McDonald's Big Mac has shrunk significantly in size since the 1980s, with some posts asserting a 40% reduction, is false. Claim: Social media posts on Facebook, widely shared in Danish and English, claim that the Big Mac has decreased significantly in size since the 1980s, with an accompanying image purportedly showing a larger 1980s Big Mac compared to a 2024 version. The posts also claim the price has increased significantly. Key Evidence: - McDonald's Denmark, through communications officer Mads Jensen, stated that the Big Mac's size has not changed since its introduction in Denmark in 1981. - TjekDet measured three Big Macs from Copenhagen restaurants, weighing 200g, 206g, and 222g, averaging close to the 209g recorded in 2001 via the Wayback Machine, with 511 calories then and 510 calories now. - US data shows a Big Mac weighed 216g in 2003 and contained 530 calories in 1996, compared to 590 calories today, indicating no reduction and possibly a slight increase in caloric content. - The image used in social media posts lacks verifiable documentation to confirm the alleged size difference. - While the price has risen (from 45 cents in 1968 to $5.69 in the US and 39 kroner in Denmark in 2024), inflation accounts for most of the increase, with 45 cents in 1968 equating to about $4 today. Justification: The evidence consistently shows that the Big Mac's size has remained stable over decades in both Denmark and the US, with weights and calorie counts aligning closely between historical and current data. The social media image lacks credible sourcing, and McDonald's official statement refutes the claim. The price increase, while notable, is largely explained by inflation, not a change in product size. Therefore, the claim of a significant size reduction is unsupported and false.

The evidence: TjekDet examined calorie and weight data from McDonald’s websites and physical purchases. Big Macs in Denmark today weigh around 200–222g, similar to the 209g recorded in 2001. Calorie counts have remained consistent over time, with slight fluctuations. McDonald's Denmark denies any size changes, and archived data from the US also shows no substantial size reduction since at least 1996.  The verdict: False – There is no credible evidence that the Big Mac has shrunk in size since the 1980s. The burger's weight and caloric content have remained largely consistent, and inflation-adjusted price increases are modest.;1. What is the claim being assessed? The claim is that McDonald’s Big Mac has significantly shrunk in size—by up to 40%—since the 1980s, while its price has increased substantially. 2. What is the verdict? False. 3. What reasoning or evidence supports this decision? Extensive research, including physical measurements of current Big Macs and archived data from 2001 and earlier, shows that the burger’s weight and calorie content have remained largely stable over the past decades. McDonald’s Denmark officially denies any size changes, citing regulations preventing such modifications. While prices have increased, the rise is moderate when adjusted for inflation. Therefore, the evidence does not support the claim of a significant size reduction.;Fact Check: Claims of Shrunken Big Macs Since the 1980s Are False;The Claim: Social media posts claim that the McDonald's Big Mac has significantly shrunk in size (some stating 40% smaller) and simultaneously increased significantly in price since the 1980s, often using a comparative image of two burgers.  The Evidence: McDonald's Denmark denies any change in Big Mac size since 1981, stating they are not allowed to do that at all. TjekDet's research using the Wayback Machine found that a Danish Big Mac in 2001 weighed 209 grams and contained 511 calories, which is consistent with current measurements (200-222 grams and 510 calories). For the US, calorie counts were 530 in 1996 and 590 currently, and weight in 2003 was 216 grams, also consistent. While the price has increased, adjusting for inflation, the 1968 price of 45 cents is equivalent to just over $4 today, compared to the current US price of $5.69, indicating a moderate increase, not a significant one when inflation is considered.  The Verdict: False. There is no indication that the Big Mac has shrunk in size since the 1980s. While the price has increased, it's not a significant increase when accounting for inflation.;Here's the final verdict based on the fact-check: 1. What is the claim being assessed? The claim being assessed is that the McDonald's Big Mac has significantly shrunk in size (some claims stating 40% smaller) since the 1980s, while simultaneously increasing significantly in price. This claim is often supported by a comparative image of a 1980s Big Mac and a 2024 Big Mac. 2. What is the verdict? False. 3. What reasoning or evidence supports this decision?  Size: McDonald's Denmark explicitly denies any change in the Big Mac's size since its introduction to Denmark in 1981, stating they are not allowed to do that at all. Further evidence from TjekDet's research using the Wayback Machine shows that a Big Mac in Denmark in 2001 weighed 209 grams and contained 511 calories, which is consistent with current measurements (200-222 grams and 510 calories). For the US, historical data from 1996 and 2003 also shows consistent calorie counts (530 in 1996, 590 currently) and weight (216 grams in 2003) compared to today, refuting the claim of significant shrinkage.  Price: While the nominal price of the Big Mac has increased, the fact-check demonstrates that when adjusted for inflation, the increase is not significant. For instance, the 1968 price of 45 cents is equivalent to just over $4 today, while a Big Mac in the USA currently costs $5.69. This shows a moderate increase, not a drastic one that would support the claim of a significant price increase in real terms.;Claim That Big Mac Has Shrunk Significantly in Size Since 1980s Is False;The claim: Social media posts claim that McDonald's Big Mac has shrunk significantly in size since the 1980s, with some claiming it's become 40% smaller, while also increasing in price. The evidence: The fact-check cites McDonald's press department denying any size change, consistent weight and calorie information from archived website data (2001 in Denmark and 1996 in the US), and physical measurements of Big Macs purchased in Copenhagen (weighing 200-222 grams, comparable to 209 grams in 2001). The price increase is acknowledged, but adjusting for inflation, it's not significant. The verdict: The claim that the Big Mac has shrunk in size is false. The evidence shows that the size and weight of the Big Mac have remained largely consistent over the years, while the price increase is not unusual when adjusted for inflation. ;Based on the fact-check, here's the final verdict: The claim being assessed: The claim is that McDonald's Big Mac has shrunk significantly in size since the 1980s, while also increasing in price, with some specific claims that it has become 40% smaller. The verdict: False Reasoning or evidence: The verdict is based on the following evidence: McDonald's press department's denial of any size change. Consistent weight and calorie information from archived website data (2001 in Denmark and 1996 in the US). Physical measurements of Big Macs purchased in Copenhagen, which showed weights (200-222 grams) comparable to archived data (209 grams in 2001). The price increase is acknowledged, but when adjusted for inflation, it's not significant, contradicting the claim of a substantial price hike without a corresponding size change. Overall, the evidence suggests that the size of the Big Mac has remained largely consistent over the years, refuting the claim that it has shrunk significantly.;No Shrinkage: False Claim That McDonald's Big Mac Is 40% Smaller Since the 1980s Debunked;"The claim: Social media posts, widely shared in Danish and English, assert that McDonald's Big Mac has shrunk by 40% in size since the 1980s while significantly increasing in price, supported by an image comparing a supposed 1980s Big Mac to a 2024 version. - The evidence: TjekDet's investigation found no evidence of size reduction, with Big Macs in Denmark weighing 200–222 grams in 2024, similar to 209 grams in 2001 (per Wayback Machine).

FC_11;Bullet point summary;Has your Big Mac gotten significantly smaller since the 1980s?; Several viral posts on social media claim that the McDonald's Big Mac has shrunk by 40 percent since 1980.      A picture of a Big Mac, supposedly from the 1980s, is used as documentation.      But TjekDets research shows that there is no indication that the popular burger has shrunk in recent decades. ;This is the fact to chek: A sure winner among hangover-stricken Danes on January 1st is McDonalds - and many probably swear by one of their signature burgers - the Big Mac. But would you have been fuller if you had sunk your teeth into a Big Mac back in the 1980s? At least that's what several posts on Facebook claim, which are currently being seen by thousands of users. The posts claim that the burger has shrunk significantly in size , while at the same time increasing significantly in price . The claim is widespread in both Danish and English Facebook posts . One of the English posts has 29,000 shares , while another has been shared more than 9,000 times . Some of the posts claim that the burger has become 40 percent smaller . As documentation, many of the posts use the same image, which shows two Big Macs. One is supposedly from the 1980s, while the other is from 2024. If the image is to be believed, then there is a significant size difference. This image is repeated in numerous posts, where it is claimed that McDonald's Big Mac has shrunk significantly since the happy 80s (Photo: Screenshot of Facebook). But while it might take two Big Macs to cure your hangover today, it wouldn't have been any different in the 1980s According to TjekDet's research, there is no indication that the Big Mac has shrunk since the 1980s. However, it has increased in price - although not very much if you take inflation into account. The price increase According to an article from the Pennsylvania Center for the Book, the Big Mac was first introduced in the 1960s by Jim Delligatti, who owned a number of McDonald's restaurants in Pittsburgh, USA. In 1968, the Big Mac was added to the menu at all McDonald's restaurants in the United States. And the price? It was 45 cents. If you use an inflation converter to calculate what 45 cents in 1968 is worth today, the answer is just over $4. Today, a Big Mac in the USA costs $5.69 - equivalent to just over 40 Danish kroner, while the normal price in Denmark is 39 kroner for one of the popular burgers. From country to country, there is virtually no difference in what a Big Mac looks like. That is why the media outlet “The Economist” has published  the “Big Mac Index” since 1986 as a way to compare price levels across borders and currencies. In 2024,  “The Economist” has calculated that Switzerland will have the world's most expensive Big Mac with a price of $8.17 - equivalent to about 58 Danish kroner. But what about the size? The price is one thing, but what happened to the size of the Big Mac? Some of the posts on social media claim that the burger has become 40 percent smaller since 1980. If you ask McDonald's press department in Denmark, they flatly deny that the Big Mac has changed size. “The size of Big Mac's has not changed since McDonald's came to Denmark in 1981. We are not allowed to do that at all,” says Mads Jensen, a communications officer at McDonald's. Today, McDonald's Danish website states that a Big Mac contains 510 calories. If you look at the American version , it contains 590 calories. But on neither the Danish nor the American website can you see how much a Big Mac weighs. Therefore, TjekDet bought three Big Mac's at three different McDonald's restaurants in Copenhagen and here the weight was 200 grams, 206 grams and 222 grams. By using the Wayback Machine, which is an internet archiving tool, TjekDet has managed to find the content description for a Big Mac in Denmark back in 2001 . Back then, a Big Mac weighed 209 grams and contained 2137 kJ, which corresponds to 511 calories. In terms of both weight and calories, the Big Mac is basically the same today as it was more than 20 years ago, so you shouldn't feel cheated when you sink your teeth into a Big Mac in 2025. However, the number of calories has varied a little. In 2019, McDonald's website stated that there were 503 calories in a Big Mac, while in 2022 there were 487 calories - and as previously mentioned - today there are 510 calories in one of the popular burgers.  In 2020, McDonald's in Denmark had a turnover of 2.7 billion kroner, McDonald's writes on its own website. Photo: Shutterstock More calories in Everything is bigger in the USA sounds like a cool phrase, but when it comes to Big Macs, there isn't much difference between Denmark and the USA. For Big Macs in the US, there are significantly more content designations to dig up than in recent decades, and there is nothing to suggest that the Big Mac has shrunk in size. The biggest difference from Denmark is the number of calories, which is generally higher in the US than in Denmark. In 1996 we can see that there were 530 calories in an American Big Mac , so there are actually more calories in the burger in 2025 than back then - namely 590 calories. In 2003, we can see that the burger weighed 216 grams, which is roughly consistent with the results that TjekDet obtained. Even though we can't go back any further than 1996 for the USA and 2001 for Denmark, there is no documentation that the popular burger has become smaller.;Least-to-most ;McDonald’s Big Mac Has Not Shrunk Since the 1980s Despite Viral Claims;1. Verdict: False — the claim that the Big Mac has shrunk significantly (by about 40%) since the 1980s is not supported by the evidence. 2. Evidence:  McDonald’s Denmark states the size of the Big Mac has not changed since 1981 and that they are not allowed to alter it.  Measurements of current Big Macs in Copenhagen show weights around 200–222 grams.  Archived data from 2001 shows a Big Mac weighed about 209 grams with 511 calories, similar to today’s 510 calories and roughly the same weight.  US data from 1996 to 2025 shows consistent or slightly increasing calorie counts and similar weights.  Price has increased since the 1960s but is roughly in line with inflation, and prices vary by country.  The viral image showing a size difference is likely misleading. 3. Claim: The viral social media posts claim that the McDonald’s Big Mac has shrunk by about 40% since the 1980s while its price has significantly increased. --- Summary: The claim circulating on social media that the Big Mac has shrunk significantly since the 1980s, with many posts showing images purportedly comparing sizes, is false. According to McDonald’s Denmark and independent measurements, the size and weight of the Big Mac have remained essentially consistent since it was introduced in Denmark in 1981. Archived data from 2001 and calorie counts over time support this. Although the price of the Big Mac has increased since its introduction in the 1960s, the rise is roughly consistent with inflation, and prices differ by country. The viral images showing a marked size difference appear misleading. Therefore, the evidence refutes the claim that the Big Mac has become smaller, concluding that the burger’s size has stayed stable over the decades.;Certainly! Here’s the verdict breakdown: 1. What is the claim being evaluated? The claim is that the McDonald’s Big Mac has shrunk by about 40% in size since the 1980s, while its price has increased significantly. 2. Based on the evidence provided, is the claim true, false, mixed or another verdict category? False. 3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict?  McDonald’s Denmark confirms the Big Mac size has not changed since 1981 and they are not allowed to alter it.  Measurements from current Big Macs in Denmark show consistent weight (\~200–222 grams) compared to archived data from 2001 (209 grams).  Calorie counts have remained roughly stable over time, indicating no significant size reduction.  US data also shows no shrinkage in size, with similar or slightly increased calorie counts.  Price increases align with inflation, and the visual evidence (viral photos) claiming shrinkage is misleading. --- Final Verdict: The claim that the Big Mac has shrunk significantly since the 1980s is false. Reliable data from McDonald’s, direct measurements, historical records, and calorie information all indicate that the size and weight of the Big Mac have remained essentially unchanged over the decades. Although prices have risen, they have done so in line with inflation, and the viral images suggesting shrinkage are misleading.;Fact Check: No, Your Big Mac Hasn't Shrunk (But It Does Cost a Bit More);1. Verdict: False. 2. Evidence: McDonald's Denmark denies any change in Big Mac size since 1981, stating they are not permitted to do so. TjekDet's own measurements of current Big Macs (200-222g) are consistent with historical data from 2001 (209g) for Denmark and 2003 (216g) for the USA. Calorie counts for the Big Mac in Denmark have remained largely consistent (510 calories today vs. 511 in 2001), and in the USA, calories have actually increased (590 today vs. 530 in 1996). While the price has increased, when adjusted for inflation, the increase is not significant. 3. Claim: The Big Mac has shrunk significantly in size (some claims suggest 40% smaller) while simultaneously increasing significantly in price since the 1980s. Summary: The claim that McDonald's Big Mac has significantly shrunk in size since the 1980s, while drastically increasing in price, is false. Evidence refutes the size reduction, with McDonald's Denmark explicitly stating the burger's size has not changed since 1981. Fact-checkers' measurements of current Big Macs align closely with historical weight and calorie data from the early 2000s for both Denmark and the USA, indicating no significant decrease in size. In fact, calorie content in US Big Macs has even increased since 1996. While the price of the Big Mac has risen, the increase is not substantial when inflation is taken into account.;"1. What is the claim being evaluated? The claim being evaluated is that the McDonald's Big Mac burger has significantly shrunk in size since the 1980s (with some posts claiming it's 40% smaller) while simultaneously increasing significantly in price. 2. Based on the evidence provided, is the claim true, false, mixed or another verdict category? False. 3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict? The evidence strongly refutes the claim. McDonald's Denmark explicitly denies any change in the Big Mac's size since 1981, stating they are not allowed to alter it. TjekDet's own measurements of current Big Macs (200-222 grams) are consistent with historical data: 209 grams in Denmark in 2001 and 216 grams in the USA in 2003. Calorie counts also show no significant decrease; a Danish Big Mac today has 510 calories compared to 511 in 2001, and an American Big Mac today has 590 calories, which is more than the 530 calories it had in 1996. While the price has increased, when adjusted for inflation, the increase is not substantial (45 cents in 1968 is equivalent to just over $4 today, while a Big Mac costs $5.69 in the USA today). Final Verdict: The claim that the McDonald's Big Mac has significantly shrunk in size while drastically increasing in price since the 1980s is false. Evidence from McDonald's itself, consistent weight measurements over decades, and calorie counts (which have either remained stable or increased) all indicate that the burger's size has not diminished. While the price has increased, it has not done so significantly when accounting for inflation.";Big Mac Not Shrinking: Claim That Burger Has Significantly Reduced in Size Since 1980s Is False;Verdict: False Evidence: McDonald's press department in Denmark denies that the Big Mac has changed size. A Big Mac weighed 209 grams in 2001 and weighs similarly today (200-222 grams in recent measurements).

Verdict: The claim is false. 2. Evidence: - McDonald's Denmark press department denies any size change in the Big Mac since 1981. - TjekDet's measurements of Big Macs in Copenhagen (2024) show weights of 200g, 206g, and 222g, compared to 209g in 2001, indicating no significant size reduction. - Calorie counts in Denmark: 511 calories in 2001, 503 in 2019, 487 in 2022, and 510 in 2024, showing minor fluctuations but no consistent decrease. - In the USA, a Big Mac weighed 216g in 2003 and has 590 calories in 2024, up from 530 in 1996, suggesting no size reduction and an increase in calories. - The widely shared image comparing a 1980s Big Mac to a 2024 one lacks verified documentation and is not supported by historical data. - The Big Mac Index by The Economist indicates consistent composition across countries, supporting standardized size. 3. Claim: The Big Mac has shrunk significantly in size (some posts claim by 40%) since the 1980s while increasing in price. Summary: The claim that McDonald's Big Mac has shrunk significantly in size since the 1980s, with some social media posts alleging a 40% reduction, is false. TjekDet's investigation found no evidence supporting a size decrease. Measurements of Big Macs in Copenhagen in 2024 (200g, 206g, 222g) align closely with the 209g weight recorded in 2001, and calorie counts in Denmark (511 in 2001, 510 in 2024) show only minor variations. In the USA, a Big Mac weighed 216g in 2003 and contains 590 calories in 2024, compared to 530 in 1996, indicating no reduction and even a slight increase in caloric content. McDonald's Denmark confirms the Big Mac's size has remained unchanged since 1981, and the Big Mac Index supports standardized composition globally. The viral image comparing a supposed 1980s Big Mac to a 2024 one lacks credible documentation. While the price has increased (from 45 cents in 1968 to $5.69 in the USA and 39 kroner in Denmark in 2024), this is largely in line with inflation. The evidence consistently refutes the claim of a smaller Big Mac, confirming the burger's size has remained stable over decades.;1. What is the claim being evaluated? The claim is that McDonald's Big Mac has shrunk significantly in size since the 1980s, with some social media posts alleging a 40% reduction, while also increasing in price. 2.

Final Verdict: The claim that the Big Mac has shrunk significantly in size since the 1980s is false. Evidence from TjekDet's measurements, historical calorie and weight data, McDonald's official statements, and the Big Mac Index shows no significant size reduction. The viral image lacks credible documentation, and price increases are largely explained by inflation, further undermining the claim.

Evidence:  McDonald’s Denmark denies any change in Big Mac size since 1981, stating it is not allowed to alter it.  Contemporary Big Macs in Denmark weigh around 200–220 grams and contain about 510 calories.  Archived data from 2001 shows a Big Mac weighed 209 grams with 511 calories, almost identical to today’s measurements.  In the US, historical data from 1996 and 2003 shows similar weight and calorie content to current Big Macs.  Price-wise, while the nominal cost of a Big Mac has increased, adjusted for inflation, the price rise is moderate (e.g., 45 cents in 1968 equals about \$4 today; the current US price is around \$5.69).  The “Big Mac Index” confirms price variations across countries but does not indicate size changes. Verdict: False. There is no credible evidence that the Big Mac has shrunk in size since the 1980s. Weight and calorie data from past decades closely match current measurements, and McDonald’s official statements confirm the size has remained consistent. The price has increased, but the increase is moderate when accounting for inflation. Therefore, claims of a significant size reduction are unsubstantiated.";1. Claim: The claim is that McDonald’s Big Mac has significantly shrunk in size—by up to 40%—since the 1980s, while its price has increased substantially. 2. Final Verdict: False. 3. Explanation: The evidence shows that the size and weight of the Big Mac have remained largely consistent over the past decades, with measurements from 2001 closely matching current sizes. McDonald’s official statements also confirm the size has not changed. While the price has increased, this rise is moderate when adjusted for inflation. Therefore, the claim that the Big Mac has shrunk significantly is not supported by the facts.;Fact Check: Claims of Shrunken Big Macs Since the 80s Are False, While Price Increases Are Largely Due to Inflation;Claim: McDonald's Big Mac has significantly shrunk in size (by as much as 40%) since the 1980s, while its price has significantly increased. Evidence:  Size: McDonald's Denmark denies any change in Big Mac size since its introduction to Denmark in 1981, stating they are not allowed to do that at all.  TjekDet's research of Big Macs purchased in Copenhagen in 2025 showed weights of 200, 206, and 222 grams.  Archived data from 2001 for a Danish Big Mac showed a weight of 209 grams and 511 calories.  US data from 2003 showed a Big Mac weighing 216 grams, consistent with current weights.  Calorie content in Denmark has varied slightly: 503 calories (2019), 487 calories (2022), and 510 calories (2025).  In the US, a Big Mac in 1996 had 530 calories, while in 2025 it has 590 calories, indicating an increase in calories, not a decrease in size.  Price: The Big Mac was introduced in the US in 1968 for 45 cents.  Adjusting for inflation, 45 cents in 1968 is equivalent to just over $4 today.  A Big Mac in the USA currently costs $5.69, and in Denmark, it costs 39 kroner (approximately $5.49).  While the price has increased in nominal terms, the increase is less significant when inflation is considered. Verdict: False. There is no indication that the Big Mac has shrunk in size since the 1980s. In terms of weight and calories, it remains largely the same or has even seen a slight increase in calories in the US. While the price has increased, it is not drastically higher when adjusted for inflation.;Claim being assessed: McDonald's Big Mac has significantly shrunk in size (by as much as 40%) since the 1980s, while its price has significantly increased. Verdict: False. Explanation: The evidence strongly refutes the claim that the Big Mac has shrunk in size. McDonald's Denmark explicitly denies any change in the burger's size since 1981. Measurements of current Big Macs in Copenhagen (200-222 grams) are consistent with archived data from 2001 (209 grams) and US data from 2003 (216 grams). Furthermore, calorie counts for US Big Macs have actually increased from 530 in 1996 to 590 in 2025, suggesting no reduction in overall content. While the nominal price of the Big Mac has increased since its 1968 introduction at 45 cents, when adjusted for inflation, the current price is not a significant increase and remains relatively consistent with its historical value.;Fact-Check: No, Big Mac Hasn't Shrunk Significantly in Size Since the 1980s;Claim: The Big Mac has shrunk significantly in size since the 1980s, with some posts claiming it has become 40% smaller. Evidence: An image circulating on Facebook comparing a Big Mac from the 1980s to one from 2024 appears to show a significant size difference. McDonald's press department in Denmark denies that the Big Mac has changed size since 1981. Research found that the weight of a Big Mac in Denmark was consistent over the past 20 years, with a weight of 209 grams in 2001 and weights ranging from 200-222 grams in 2024. The calorie count has remained relatively consistent, with 511 calories in 2001 and 510 calories in 2024. In the US, the calorie count has increased slightly from 530 calories in 1996 to 590 calories in 2024, and the weight was 216 grams in 2003. Verdict: False. The evidence shows that the size of the Big Mac has not changed significantly since the 1980s, contradicting the claim. While the price has increased, it is not disproportionate to inflation. McDonald's statements and historical data on weight and calorie count support the conclusion that the Big Mac's size has remained consistent.;Claim: The Big Mac has shrunk significantly in size since the 1980s. Verdict: False. Explanation: The evidence provided shows that the size of the Big Mac has remained consistent over the years. McDonald's press department in Denmark stated that the size of the Big Mac has not changed since 1981. Additionally, research found that the weight of a Big Mac in Denmark was 209 grams in 2001 and ranged from 200-222 grams in 2024, indicating no significant change. The calorie count has also remained relatively consistent, further supporting the conclusion that the Big Mac's size has not shrunk significantly. While an image circulating on Facebook appears to show a size difference, the factual evidence contradicts the claim, leading to a verdict of False.;No Shrinkage Here: McDonald's Big Mac Size Unchanged Since 1980s, Price Increase Aligned with Inflation;Claim: Social media posts claim that McDonald's Big Mac has shrunk by 40% in size since the 1980s while significantly increasing in price, supported by an image comparing a 1980s Big Mac to one from 2024. Evidence: - McDonald's Denmark denies any size change since 1981, stating the Big Mac recipe is standardized globally. - TjekDet's investigation found that Big Macs purchased in Copenhagen in 2024 weighed 200, 206, and 222 grams, similar to the 209 grams recorded in 2001 via the Wayback Machine, with calorie counts also consistent (511 calories in 2001 vs. 510 in 2024). - In the U.S., a Big Mac weighed 216 grams in 2003 and contains 590 calories in 2024, up from 530 in 1996, indicating no size reduction. - Price-wise, a Big Mac cost 45 cents in 1968 (about $4 today, adjusted for inflation), compared to $5.69 in the U.S. and 39 kroner in Denmark in 2024, showing a modest increase when inflation is considered. - The Big Mac Index by The Economist confirms consistent burger composition across countries. Verdict: The claim is false. Evidence shows the Big Mac has not shrunk in size since the 1980s in either Denmark or the U.S., with weights and calorie counts remaining stable. While prices have increased, the rise aligns with inflation, contradicting claims of significant price hikes. The image circulating on social media lacks verifiable evidence to support the claim of a size reduction.;Claim: Social media posts assert that McDonald's Big Mac has decreased in size by 40% since the 1980s while its price has significantly increased, supported by an image comparing a 1980s Big Mac to one from 2024. Verdict: False Explanation: The evidence refutes the claim of a 40% size reduction. In Denmark, Big Macs weighed approximately 209 grams in 2001 and 200–222 grams in 2024, with consistent calorie counts (511 in 2001 vs. 510 in 2024). In the U.S., a Big Mac weighed 216 grams in 2003 and has 590 calories in 2024, up from 530 in 1996, indicating no shrinkage. McDonald's Denmark confirms the burger’s size has not changed since 1981, and the global standardization of the Big Mac supports this. Regarding price, a 1968 U.S. Big Mac cost 45 cents (about $4 today, adjusted for inflation), compared to $5.69 in 2024, a modest increase. The viral image lacks verifiable evidence. Thus, the claim of significant size reduction and disproportionate price increase is not supported by the data.
FC_11;Bullet point summary;Has your Big Mac gotten significantly smaller since the 1980s?; Several viral posts on social media claim that the McDonald's Big Mac has shrunk by 40 percent since 1980.      A picture of a Big Mac, supposedly from the 1980s, is used as documentation.      But TjekDets research shows that there is no indication that the popular burger has shrunk in recent decades. ;This is the fact to chek: A sure winner among hangover-stricken Danes on January 1st is McDonalds - and many probably swear by one of their signature burgers - the Big Mac. But would you have been fuller if you had sunk your teeth into a Big Mac back in the 1980s? At least that's what several posts on Facebook claim, which are currently being seen by thousands of users. The posts claim that the burger has shrunk significantly in size , while at the same time increasing significantly in price . The claim is widespread in both Danish and English Facebook posts . One of the English posts has 29,000 shares , while another has been shared more than 9,000 times . Some of the posts claim that the burger has become 40 percent smaller . As documentation, many of the posts use the same image, which shows two Big Macs. One is supposedly from the 1980s, while the other is from 2024. If the image is to be believed, then there is a significant size difference. This image is repeated in numerous posts, where it is claimed that McDonald's Big Mac has shrunk significantly since the happy 80s (Photo: Screenshot of Facebook). But while it might take two Big Macs to cure your hangover today, it wouldn't have been any different in the 1980s According to TjekDet's research, there is no indication that the Big Mac has shrunk since the 1980s. However, it has increased in price - although not very much if you take inflation into account. The price increase According to an article from the Pennsylvania Center for the Book, the Big Mac was first introduced in the 1960s by Jim Delligatti, who owned a number of McDonald's restaurants in Pittsburgh, USA. In 1968, the Big Mac was added to the menu at all McDonald's restaurants in the United States. And the price? It was 45 cents. If you use an inflation converter to calculate what 45 cents in 1968 is worth today, the answer is just over $4. Today, a Big Mac in the USA costs $5.69 - equivalent to just over 40 Danish kroner, while the normal price in Denmark is 39 kroner for one of the popular burgers. From country to country, there is virtually no difference in what a Big Mac looks like. That is why the media outlet “The Economist” has published  the “Big Mac Index” since 1986 as a way to compare price levels across borders and currencies. In 2024,  “The Economist” has calculated that Switzerland will have the world's most expensive Big Mac with a price of $8.17 - equivalent to about 58 Danish kroner. But what about the size? The price is one thing, but what happened to the size of the Big Mac? Some of the posts on social media claim that the burger has become 40 percent smaller since 1980. If you ask McDonald's press department in Denmark, they flatly deny that the Big Mac has changed size. “The size of Big Mac's has not changed since McDonald's came to Denmark in 1981. We are not allowed to do that at all,” says Mads Jensen, a communications officer at McDonald's. Today, McDonald's Danish website states that a Big Mac contains 510 calories. If you look at the American version , it contains 590 calories. But on neither the Danish nor the American website can you see how much a Big Mac weighs. Therefore, TjekDet bought three Big Mac's at three different McDonald's restaurants in Copenhagen and here the weight was 200 grams, 206 grams and 222 grams. By using the Wayback Machine, which is an internet archiving tool, TjekDet has managed to find the content description for a Big Mac in Denmark back in 2001 . Back then, a Big Mac weighed 209 grams and contained 2137 kJ, which corresponds to 511 calories. In terms of both weight and calories, the Big Mac is basically the same today as it was more than 20 years ago, so you shouldn't feel cheated when you sink your teeth into a Big Mac in 2025. However, the number of calories has varied a little. In 2019, McDonald's website stated that there were 503 calories in a Big Mac, while in 2022 there were 487 calories - and as previously mentioned - today there are 510 calories in one of the popular burgers.  In 2020, McDonald's in Denmark had a turnover of 2.7 billion kroner, McDonald's writes on its own website. Photo: Shutterstock More calories in Everything is bigger in the USA sounds like a cool phrase, but when it comes to Big Macs, there isn't much difference between Denmark and the USA. For Big Macs in the US, there are significantly more content designations to dig up than in recent decades, and there is nothing to suggest that the Big Mac has shrunk in size. The biggest difference from Denmark is the number of calories, which is generally higher in the US than in Denmark. In 1996 we can see that there were 530 calories in an American Big Mac , so there are actually more calories in the burger in 2025 than back then - namely 590 calories. In 2003, we can see that the burger weighed 216 grams, which is roughly consistent with the results that TjekDet obtained. Even though we can't go back any further than 1996 for the USA and 2001 for Denmark, there is no documentation that the popular burger has become smaller.;Zero-shot;McDonald’s Big Mac Has Not Shrunk Since the 1980s — Claim Proven False;"Claim being evaluated: Social media posts claim that McDonald’s Big Mac has significantly shrunk in size (by about 40%) since the 1980s, while its price has increased substantially. Key evidence used to assess the claim:  McDonald’s Denmark denies any change in Big Mac size since their arrival in 1981.  Weights of current Big Macs in Denmark average around 200–222 grams, consistent with archived data from 2001 showing a Big Mac weighing 209 grams.  Calorie counts for the Big Mac in Denmark have remained roughly stable over the past two decades (around 500 calories).  U.S. data from 1996 and 2003 also show consistent Big Mac weights and calorie counts, with no indication of size reduction.  Price increases have occurred but align reasonably with inflation and vary by country; the U.S. price today is about \$5.69 compared to 45 cents in 1968 (which is roughly \$4 in today’s money).  The “40% smaller” size claim is not supported by physical evidence or official data. Verdict: False — There is no credible evidence that the Big Mac has shrunk significantly since the 1980s; the size has remained essentially the same, while price increases align with inflation.";1. Claim being evaluated: The claim is that McDonald’s Big Mac has shrunk significantly in size (by about 40%) since the 1980s, while its price has increased substantially. 2. Verdict: False 3. Explanation: The evidence shows that the size and weight of the Big Mac have remained consistent from the 1980s through today, supported by official statements from McDonald’s Denmark and archived data on weight and calorie content. Although the price has increased, this rise aligns with inflation and does not reflect an unusual price hike. Therefore, the claim that the Big Mac has shrunk significantly in size is not supported by the facts.;Fact Check: Big Mac Size and Price Claims Are False – No Shrinkage Since the 80s, Price Rise Aligns with Inflation;"Claim: The McDonald's Big Mac has significantly shrunk in size (by as much as 40%) since the 1980s, while also significantly increasing in price. Key Evidence:  Size:  McDonald's Denmark communications officer explicitly denies any size change since 1981, stating it's not permitted.  Comparison of Big Mac weight in Denmark: 2001 data shows 209 grams, while 2025 measurements of three Big Macs ranged from 200 to 222 grams, indicating consistent size.  Calorie content in Denmark has remained similar: 511 calories in 2001 versus 510 calories today, with minor fluctuations in between.  US Big Mac data shows no indication of shrinkage; 1996 calorie count was 530, while today it's 590, suggesting it's slightly larger. A 2003 weight of 216 grams is consistent with current Danish weights.  The Big Mac Index from The Economist (since 1986) uses the Big Mac's consistent appearance globally to compare price levels, implicitly supporting a stable size.  Price:  In 1968, a Big Mac in the US cost 45 cents, which, adjusted for inflation, would be just over $4 today.  Today, a Big Mac in the US costs $5.69, and in Denmark, it costs 39 kroner (approximately $5.50). This shows an increase in price, but not a significant one when inflation is considered. Verdict: False. There is no evidence to suggest that the Big Mac has shrunk in size since the 1980s. While the price has increased, it is largely in line with inflation.";1. Claim Being Evaluated: The claim is that the McDonald's Big Mac has significantly shrunk in size (some posts claim by 40%) since the 1980s, while simultaneously increasing significantly in price. 2. Verdict: False. 3. Brief Explanation: Evidence from McDonald's Denmark, historical weight and calorie data for Big Macs in both Denmark and the US, and the consistent use of the Big Mac as a global economic index (Big Mac Index) all indicate that the burger's size has remained largely consistent since the 1980s or early 2000s. While the price has increased, adjusting for inflation reveals that the increase is not as significant as widely claimed on social media.;Big Mac Shrunk Since 1980s? False: Fact-Check Finds No Evidence of Size Reduction;"Claim: Facebook posts claim that the McDonald's Big Mac has shrunk significantly in size since the 1980s, with some claiming a 40% reduction in size.

Verdict: False Brief explanation: The claim is false because the evidence presented in the fact-check shows that the size of the Big Mac has remained relatively consistent over the years. McDonald's press department denies any size change, and historical data on weight and calorie count supports this claim. Weight measurements of current Big Macs (ranging from 200-222 grams) are consistent with historical data from 2001 (209 grams) and 2003 (216 grams).

Explanation: Evidence shows no significant size reduction in the Big Mac. Measurements from 2024 in Denmark (200–222 grams) align closely with 2001 data (209 grams), and calorie counts remain consistent (510 calories in 2024 vs. 511 in 2001 in Denmark; 590 in 2024 vs. 530 in 1996 in the USA). McDonald's Denmark confirms no size changes since 1981. The price has increased (from 45 cents in 1968 to $5.69 in 2024 in the USA), but this is largely in line with inflation.

FC_12;Assertion;Is it true that over half of Ukrainians would give up land for peace?;Assertion The majority of the Ukrainian population now says, according to Gallup, that they want an end to the war. They want peace negotiations, cede territories, rather than continue this war. Conclusion It is true, according to the 2024 poll, that 52 percent of the population wants peace negotiations to end the war as soon as possible. However, it is not true that half the population wants to cede territories. The survey only asked respondents who already wanted peace negotiations whether they were open to ceding territories. Here again, 52 percent answered yes.;This is the fact-check: During NRK's ​​Debatten on May 20, the leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), Marielle Leraand, brought up an opinion poll conducted by the American analysis agency Gallup . The agency regularly conducts surveys in Ukraine as part of its World Poll .Leraand claimed that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country.We have reviewed the numbers to find out if her claim is true.It is true that over half (52 percent) of those surveyed said they wanted Ukraine to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible.However, it is not true that the majority have said they want to give up land. The survey only asked the question of whether Ukraine should give up land to those who responded that they wanted peace negotiations. Of these, 52 percent responded that they wanted to give up land in negotiations. 38 percent responded that they did not want this, and nine percent were unsure or refrained from answering.When asked first whether Ukraine should negotiate or continue fighting, 38 percent said the country should continue fighting until it wins the war. This is a decrease from Gallup's previous surveys from 2023 and 2022. In 2022, 73 percent were in favor of continuing to fight, and 63 percent said the same in 2023.Both VG and NRK have investigated several of the allegations that emerged during the Debate.The Gallup poll was conducted in August and October 2024, with the figures published in November of the same year. It is reported that the agency is unable to conduct the surveys in occupied territories due to lack of coverage by Ukrainian telecom operators. This means that approximately 10–12 percent of the population is excluded from the surveys.The agency has regularly conducted surveys in Ukraine. In an article, they explain the challenges involved in conducting surveys in a war zone .Professor at the Department of Political Science at the University of Oslo, Jørgen Bølstad, tells Faktisk.no that even though the surveys were conducted in a country at war, we can read something from them.Bølstad also explains that there is consistency between the surveys from Gallup and other surveys, including those from the Kyiv Institute of Sociology  (KIIS).– Findings from KIIS indicate that around 38 percent are willing to give up land to get a quick peace agreement, while 51 percent are not, says Bølstad.– This also illustrates that the wording of the questions is absolutely crucial. It is not surprising that a people at war can imagine peace. The big question is what kind of peace they want, and at what price. It is unlikely that many people want the West to stop sending aid.He also says that it is important to take into account that the surveys were conducted a few months ago, and that things may have changed in the meantime.– Difficult to explain all the detailsFOR leader Marielle Leraand writes in an email to Faktisk.no that the format of the Debate made it difficult to explain all the details of the survey.– The answer options in the survey were “Ukraine should continue fighting until it wins the war”. 38 percent thought this. The Norwegian public has created the impression that an overwhelming majority of Ukrainians will continue to fight.– But 52 percent thought that: “Ukraine should seek to negotiate an ending to the war as soon as possible”. That is what we in FOR think. We do not have a specific opinion about what the negotiation result should be.;Vanilla;Claim That Most Ukrainians Support Giving Up Land for Peace Is Misleading, Fact-Check Finds;Assertion: Marielle Leraand, leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), claimed during NRK's Debatten on May 20 that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country. Conclusion: The fact-check finds Leraand’s claim partly incorrect. While it is true that a majority (52%) of Ukrainians surveyed by Gallup in 2024 said they want peace negotiations to begin as soon as possible, only a subset of those respondents were asked about giving up land. Among them, just 52% supported territorial concessions, which does not constitute a majority of the general population. Therefore, the data does not support the claim that a majority of Ukrainians are willing to give up land in exchange for peace.;Verdict: Mixed. The claim is partly accurate but misleading. It is true that a majority (52%) of Ukrainians surveyed support starting peace negotiations. However, it is not true that a majority support giving up land to achieve peace — that question was only asked to a subset of respondents, and the percentage who supported territorial concessions does not represent the overall population. Thus, the claim combines accurate data with an incorrect interpretation.;Fact-Check: Majority of Ukrainians Want Peace Talks, But Not Necessarily to Cede Land;Assertion: The leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), Marielle Leraand, claimed that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country, citing a Gallup poll. Conclusion: Leraand's claim is partially true but misleading.  Verdict on majority want peace negotiations: True. The Gallup poll, conducted in August and October 2024, found that 52% of those surveyed wanted Ukraine to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible. This marks a decrease in support for continuing to fight until victory compared to previous years (38% in 2024, down from 73% in 2022 and 63% in 2023).  Verdict on majority want to give up land: False. While 52% of those who wanted peace negotiations said they were willing to give up land, this question was only asked to that specific group, not to the entire surveyed population. Therefore, it is incorrect to state that a majority of all Ukrainians want to give up land. The fact-check clarifies that 38% of those who wanted peace negotiations did not want to give up land, and 9% were unsure. Furthermore, other surveys, such as those from the Kyiv Institute of Sociology (KIIS), indicate that a majority of Ukrainians (around 51%) are not willing to give up land for a quick peace agreement. The wording of questions is crucial, and while a desire for peace is understandable, the price of that peace (i.e., territorial concessions) is a more nuanced and less universally supported position.;The verdict for the fact-check is Mixed. The claim that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations is true, based on the Gallup poll. However, the claim that a majority have said they want to give up land is false, as the survey only asked this question to a subset of respondents, and even within that subset, the majority wanting to give up land was not representative of the entire population.;Partial Truth in Claim About Ukrainians Wanting to Give Up Land for Peace;Assertion: Marielle Leraand, leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), claimed that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country, based on a Gallup opinion poll. Conclusion: The fact-check verdict is that Leraand's claim is partially true but misleading. It's true that over half (52%) of those surveyed want Ukraine to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible. However, it's not true that a majority of Ukrainians want to give up land. Among those who supported negotiations, 52% were willing to give up land, while 38% were not, and 9% were unsure. The fact-check highlights the importance of question wording and notes that survey results may have changed since the poll was conducted in August and October 2024 ¹.;Verdict: Mixed/Partially True The claim is partially true in that a majority (52%) of Ukrainians surveyed want peace negotiations. However, the claim is misleading regarding giving up land, as the survey shows that among those who want negotiations, 52% are willing to give up land, not a majority of all Ukrainians surveyed. Meta AI response: Verdict: Mixed/Partially True The claim is partially true in that a majority (52%) of Ukrainians surveyed want peace negotiations. However, the claim is misleading regarding giving up land, as the survey shows that among those who want negotiations, 52% are willing to give up land, not a majority of all Ukrainians surveyed.;Ukrainian Peace Talks Support Misstated: Majority Favor Negotiations, But Not Land Concessions, Gallup Poll Shows;Assertion: Marielle Leraand, leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), claimed during NRK's Debatten on May 20 that a Gallup poll showed a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country. Conclusion: The claim is partially true. The Gallup poll from August and October 2024, published in November 2024, confirms that 52% of Ukrainians surveyed favored peace negotiations as soon as possible. However, the claim that a majority want to give up land is inaccurate. Only 52% of those who supported negotiations (not the overall sample) were willing to cede land, while 38% opposed it, and 9% were unsure. Additionally, 38% of all respondents preferred continuing the fight until victory, a decline from 73% in 2022 and 63% in 2023. The survey’s limitations, such as excluding occupied territories and the timing of the data, add context, and other surveys (e.g., KIIS) show varied willingness to cede land, highlighting the importance of question wording.;Verdict: Mixed The claim is partially true. The Gallup poll confirms that 52% of Ukrainians surveyed favored peace negotiations as soon as possible. However, the claim that a majority want to give up land is inaccurate, as only 52% of those supporting negotiations (not the overall sample) were willing to cede land, with 38% opposing and 9% unsure.

In an article, they explain the challenges involved in conducting surveys in a war zone .Professor at the Department of Political Science at the University of Oslo, Jørgen Bølstad, tells Faktisk.no that even though the surveys were conducted in a country at war, we can read something from them.Bølstad also explains that there is consistency between the surveys from Gallup and other surveys, including those from the Kyiv Institute of Sociology  (KIIS).– Findings from KIIS indicate that around 38 percent are willing to give up land to get a quick peace agreement, while 51 percent are not, says Bølstad.– This also illustrates that the wording of the questions is absolutely crucial. It is not surprising that a people at war can imagine peace. The big question is what kind of peace they want, and at what price. It is unlikely that many people want the West to stop sending aid.He also says that it is important to take into account that the surveys were conducted a few months ago, and that things may have changed in the meantime.– Difficult to explain all the detailsFOR leader Marielle Leraand writes in an email to Faktisk.no that the format of the Debate made it difficult to explain all the details of the survey.– The answer options in the survey were “Ukraine should continue fighting until it wins the war”. 38 percent thought this. The Norwegian public has created the impression that an overwhelming majority of Ukrainians will continue to fight.– But 52 percent thought that: “Ukraine should seek to negotiate an ending to the war as soon as possible”. That is what we in FOR think. We do not have a specific opinion about what the negotiation result should be.;Ask-me-anything;Claim That Most Ukrainians Support Peace Talks Even if It Means Giving Up Land Is Misleading;Assertion: Marielle Leraand, leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), claimed during NRK’s Debatten on May 20 that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country. Conclusion: Mixed. It is true that a majority (52%) of Ukrainians surveyed by Gallup want peace negotiations to begin as soon as possible. However, it is false that a majority support giving up land. That specific question was only asked to those who favored negotiations, and among them, 52% said they were willing to give up territory, while 38% were not. The survey did not show overall majority support for territorial concessions. Additionally, the survey had limitations, such as excluding populations in occupied areas.;1. What is the claim being verified? Marielle Leraand claimed that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country. 2. What is the final verdict? Mixed. 3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict?  A majority (52%) of Ukrainians surveyed by Gallup support peace negotiations starting as soon as possible — this part of the claim is true.  However, only those who supported negotiations were asked whether Ukraine should give up land. Among them, only 52% were in favor of territorial concessions, which does not amount to a majority of all Ukrainians — making this part of the claim false.  The survey excluded around 10–12% of the population living in occupied areas, which may also affect the overall representativeness of the results.  Expert commentary emphasized that wording matters significantly and that Ukrainians can support peace without necessarily accepting loss of territory. Therefore, the claim is partially accurate but misrepresents the full picture, leading to a mixed verdict.;Claim of Majority Ukrainian Support for Peace-for-Land Deal is Mixed;Assertion: Marielle Leraand, leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), claimed during NRK's Debatten that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country, based on a Gallup poll. Conclusion: The claim is mixed.  It is true that over half (52 percent) of those surveyed by Gallup wanted Ukraine to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible.  However, it is false that a majority of all Ukrainians surveyed said they wanted to give up land. The question about giving up land was only asked to the 52% who already expressed a desire for peace negotiations. Of that subgroup, 52% (or 27% of the total surveyed) were willing to give up land, while 38% of that subgroup (or 20% of the total surveyed) were not.  Additionally, 38 percent of the total surveyed wanted the country to continue fighting until it wins the war. The fact-check also highlights that the wording of survey questions is crucial and that while many Ukrainians desire peace, the type and cost of that peace are significant factors. Findings from other surveys, like KIIS, also indicate that a significant portion are not willing to give up land.;Here's the verdict of the fact-check: 1. What is the claim being verified? Marielle Leraand, leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), claimed that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country, based on a Gallup poll. 2. What is the final verdict (true/false/mixed)? Mixed. 3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict?  Partial Truth: It is true that 52 percent of the total Ukrainians surveyed by Gallup stated they wanted Ukraine to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible.  False Aspect: It is not true that a majority of all Ukrainians surveyed said they wanted to give up land. The question about ceding territory was only posed to the subgroup of respondents who had already indicated a desire for peace negotiations. Of this specific subgroup (52% of the total respondents), 52 percent were willing to give up land, while 38 percent were not. This means only about 27% of the total surveyed population was willing to give up land.  Additional Context: The fact-check also points out that 38 percent of the total surveyed population wanted the country to continue fighting until it wins the war. Furthermore, expert opinion (Professor Jørgen Bølstad) and other surveys (Kyiv Institute of Sociology - KIIS) suggest that while Ukrainians desire peace, the specific terms and willingness to cede land are nuanced and vary depending on question wording. KIIS findings, for example, show around 38% willing to give up land for a quick peace, while 51% are not.;Mixed Verdict: Ukrainians Support Peace Talks, but Claim About Land Concessions Exaggerated;Assertion: Marielle Leraand claimed that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country. Conclusion: The verdict is Mixed. The claim is partially true in that 52% of Ukrainians surveyed want to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible. However, it's not true that a majority of Ukrainians want to give up land. Among those who support negotiations, 52% are willing to give up land, while 38% are not, and 9% are unsure. The surveys also show 38% of respondents favor continuing to fight until Ukraine wins the war, down from 73% in 2022 and 63% in 2023. The consistency between Gallup's surveys and other surveys, like those from the Kyiv Institute of Sociology, adds credibility to the findings ¹.;1. Claim being verified: The claim being verified is that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country, as stated by Marielle Leraand, the leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR). 2. Final Verdict: Mixed 3. Evidence or Reasoning: It's true that 52% of those surveyed want Ukraine to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible. However, the survey only asked about giving up land to those who responded in favor of peace negotiations, and among them, 52% supported giving up land, 38% opposed it, and 9% were unsure. Additionally, 38% of all respondents favored continuing to fight until Ukraine wins the war. This mixed verdict arises because while a majority supports negotiations, the evidence doesn't support the claim that a majority of Ukrainians are willing to give up land as part of those negotiations.

Conclusion: The claim is partially true. The Gallup poll from August and October 2024, published in November 2024, confirms that 52% of surveyed Ukrainians favored peace negotiations as soon as possible. However, the claim that a majority want to give up land is false. Only 52% of those who supported negotiations (not the overall sample) were willing to cede land, while 38% opposed it, and 9% were unsure. Additionally, 38% of all respondents wanted to continue fighting until victory, and the survey excluded 10–12% of the population in occupied territories. The complexity of question wording and the context of a war zone further nuance the interpretation, as highlighted by Professor Jørgen Bølstad and corroborated by similar findings from the Kyiv Institute of Sociology.;1. Claim Being Verified: Marielle Leraand, leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), claimed during NRK's Debatten on May 20 that a Gallup poll showed a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country. 2. Final Verdict: Mixed. 3. Evidence or Reasoning Supporting the Verdict: - The Gallup poll conducted in August and October 2024, published in November 2024, supports part of Leraand’s claim: 52% of surveyed Ukrainians favored peace negotiations as soon as possible. - However, the claim that a majority want to give up land is incorrect. The poll showed that only 52% of those who supported negotiations (not the overall sample) were willing to cede land, with 38% opposing and 9% unsure. - Additionally, 38% of all respondents preferred continuing to fight until victory, a decrease from 73% in 2022 and 63% in 2023. - The survey excluded 10–12% of the population in occupied territories due to logistical constraints. - Professor Jørgen Bølstad noted consistency with other surveys (e.g., Kyiv Institute of Sociology) and emphasized that question wording significantly affects responses, indicating that the desire for peace does not necessarily equate to willingness to cede territory.
FC_12;Assertion;Is it true that over half of Ukrainians would give up land for peace?;Assertion The majority of the Ukrainian population now says, according to Gallup, that they want an end to the war. They want peace negotiations, cede territories, rather than continue this war. Conclusion It is true, according to the 2024 poll, that 52 percent of the population wants peace negotiations to end the war as soon as possible. However, it is not true that half the population wants to cede territories. The survey only asked respondents who already wanted peace negotiations whether they were open to ceding territories. Here again, 52 percent answered yes.;This is the fact-check: During NRK's ​​Debatten on May 20, the leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), Marielle Leraand, brought up an opinion poll conducted by the American analysis agency Gallup . The agency regularly conducts surveys in Ukraine as part of its World Poll .Leraand claimed that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country.We have reviewed the numbers to find out if her claim is true.It is true that over half (52 percent) of those surveyed said they wanted Ukraine to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible.However, it is not true that the majority have said they want to give up land. The survey only asked the question of whether Ukraine should give up land to those who responded that they wanted peace negotiations. Of these, 52 percent responded that they wanted to give up land in negotiations. 38 percent responded that they did not want this, and nine percent were unsure or refrained from answering.When asked first whether Ukraine should negotiate or continue fighting, 38 percent said the country should continue fighting until it wins the war. This is a decrease from Gallup's previous surveys from 2023 and 2022. In 2022, 73 percent were in favor of continuing to fight, and 63 percent said the same in 2023.Both VG and NRK have investigated several of the allegations that emerged during the Debate.The Gallup poll was conducted in August and October 2024, with the figures published in November of the same year. It is reported that the agency is unable to conduct the surveys in occupied territories due to lack of coverage by Ukrainian telecom operators.

Conclusion: The claim is partially misleading. While it is true that a majority (52%) of Ukrainians surveyed said they want peace negotiations to begin as soon as possible, it is not accurate to say that a majority are willing to give up land. Only those who supported negotiations were asked about territorial concessions, and among them, 52% were willing to give up land, 38% were not, and 9% were unsure. Therefore, it is incorrect to generalize that a majority of all Ukrainians support territorial concessions. Furthermore, experts stress that the phrasing of questions and the timing of surveys in a war context are critical to interpreting the results accurately.;1. What is the claim being evaluated? Marielle Leraand claimed that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country. 2. What is the verdict? Mixed. 3. Justify the decision based on key supporting evidence:  It is true that 52% of Ukrainians surveyed by Gallup in late 2024 said they want Ukraine to negotiate an end to the war as soon as possible.  However, it is not true that a majority of all Ukrainians support giving up territory. Only those in favor of negotiations were asked about this, and among them, 52% supported giving up land, 38% opposed it, and 9% were unsure.  This means the percentage of all respondents supporting territorial concessions is significantly less than a majority.  Additionally, polling experts point out that question wording and timing in a war setting strongly influence results.  The survey did not include people in Russian-occupied areas, which account for 10–12% of the population, further limiting representativeness. Conclusion: The claim contains elements of truth (support for negotiations), but overstates support for giving up territory.;Ukrainian Peace Talks and Land: Majority Wants Negotiations, But Ceding Territory is a Mixed Bag, Fact-Check Finds;Assertion: Marielle Leraand, leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), claimed during NRK's Debatten that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations even if it means giving up parts of the country, citing a Gallup poll from August-October 2024. Conclusion: Leraand's claim is partially true but misleading.  Partially True: The Gallup poll did find that over half (52 percent) of those surveyed wanted Ukraine to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible.  Misleading: It is not true that the majority of all Ukrainians surveyed expressed a willingness to give up land. The question about giving up land was only asked to the 52 percent who wanted peace negotiations. Of that subset, 52 percent responded that they would be willing to give up land. This means that only approximately 27% (52% of 52%) of the total surveyed population expressed willingness to give up land. Furthermore, 38 percent of the total surveyed population explicitly stated that Ukraine should continue fighting until it wins the war. Other surveys, such as those from the Kyiv Institute of Sociology (KIIS), also indicate that a majority of Ukrainians are not willing to give up land for peace. The nuance of the survey questions and the specific phrasing are crucial, and Leraand's assertion conflated the desire for negotiations with a majority willingness to cede territory.;1. What is the claim being evaluated? Marielle Leraand, leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), claimed that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations even if it means giving up parts of the country, based on a Gallup poll conducted in August and October 2024. 2. What is the verdict (true/false/mixed)? Mixed. 3. Justify the decision based on key supporting evidence. The claim is mixed because while a significant portion of Leraand's statement is supported by the Gallup poll, a crucial part of her assertion is misleading due to misinterpretation of the survey's methodology and results.  Supporting Evidence (True aspects):  The Gallup poll indeed found that 52% of Ukrainians surveyed desired Ukraine to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible. This is a majority of the respondents.  This figure represents a notable decrease in support for continued fighting compared to previous Gallup surveys (73% in 2022, 63% in 2023), indicating a growing war weariness and desire for a resolution.  Countering Evidence (False/Misleading aspects):  Leraand's assertion that a majority of Ukrainians want to give up land is incorrect. The question about territorial concessions was only asked to the 52% who had already stated they wanted peace negotiations. Of this subset, 52% said they were willing to give up land. This means that only approximately 27% (52% of the 52% who wanted negotiations) of the total surveyed population expressed a willingness to concede territory.  Conversely, 38% of the total respondents initially stated that Ukraine should continue fighting until it wins the war, indicating a substantial portion of the population is not in favor of immediate peace at any cost, especially territorial concessions.  Professor Jørgen Bølstad from the University of Oslo highlights that other consistent surveys, like those from the Kyiv Institute of Sociology (KIIS), show that around 51% of Ukrainians are not willing to give up land for a quick peace agreement, further contradicting the idea of a majority willing to cede territory.  The fact-check emphasizes that the wording of survey questions is absolutely crucial, and Leraand's statement did not accurately reflect the conditional nature of the giving up land response within the Gallup poll.;Ukrainians on Peace Negotiations: Partly True, Partly False - Majority Want Talks, But Not Necessarily Land Concessions;Assertion: The core claim being evaluated is Marielle Leraand's statement that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country. Conclusion: The verdict is partly true and partly false. Here's the breakdown ¹: It's true that over half (52%) of Ukrainians surveyed want Ukraine to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible. However, it's not true that a majority of Ukrainians want to give up land. The survey asked only those who wanted peace negotiations about giving up land, and of those, 52% were in favor, while 38% were against, and 9% were unsure. The survey also showed that 38% of respondents believed Ukraine should continue fighting until it wins the war, down from 73% in 2022 and 63% in 2023. Professor Jørgen Bølstad notes that the wording of questions is crucial and that findings from other surveys, like the Kyiv Institute of Sociology, indicate around 38% are willing to give up land for a quick peace agreement, while 51% are not. The Gallup poll's reliability is somewhat supported by its consistency with other surveys, but its limitations include excluding approximately 10-12% of the population in occupied territories due to lack of telecom coverage.;Claim being evaluated: Marielle Leraand's claim that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country. Verdict: Mixed (Partly true, partly false) Justification: The claim is partly true because over half (52%) of those surveyed said they wanted Ukraine to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible. The claim is partly false because it's not true that a majority of Ukrainians want to give up land. Among those who wanted peace negotiations, 52% were in favor of giving up land, but this doesn't represent a majority of all respondents. In fact, the survey showed that 38% of all respondents wanted to continue fighting, and among those who wanted negotiations, 38% were against giving up land. Additional evidence from the Kyiv Institute of Sociology supports the nuance, indicating around 38% are willing to give up land for a quick peace agreement, while 51% are not.

Mixed Verdict on Gallup Poll Claim;Assertion: Marielle Leraand, leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), claimed during NRK's Debatten on May 20 that a Gallup poll showed a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country. Conclusion: The claim is partially true. The Gallup poll from August and October 2024, published in November, confirms that 52% of Ukrainians surveyed favored peace negotiations as soon as possible, supporting Leraand’s claim about wanting negotiations. However, her assertion that a majority want to give up land is inaccurate. The poll showed that only among those favoring negotiations (52% of the total), 52% were willing to cede land, which translates to about 27% of the total respondents. Additionally, 38% of all respondents wanted to continue fighting until victory, and 38% of those favoring negotiations opposed giving up land, with 9% unsure. The surveys, consistent with findings from the Kyiv Institute of Sociology, were conducted in a war zone, excluding 10–12% of the population in occupied territories, and question wording significantly influences results. Leraand noted the debate format limited her ability to clarify these nuances.;1. Claim Being Evaluated: Marielle Leraand, leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), claimed during NRK's Debatten on May 20 that a Gallup poll showed a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country. 2. Verdict: Mixed 3. Justification: - Supporting Evidence for Negotiations: The Gallup poll conducted in August and October 2024, published in November, found that 52% of respondents wanted Ukraine to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible, confirming Leraand’s claim that a majority favor negotiations. - Inaccuracy on Giving Up Land: The claim that a majority want to give up land is not supported. The poll asked about ceding land only to those favoring negotiations (52% of total respondents). Of those, 52% supported giving up land, equating to roughly 27% of the total sample, not a majority. Additionally, 38% of negotiation supporters opposed ceding land, and 9% were unsure. - Contextual Evidence: The poll also showed 38% of all respondents favored continuing the fight until victory, a decline from 73% in 2022 and 63% in 2023. Other surveys, like those from the Kyiv Institute of Sociology, align with Gallup’s findings, showing about 38% willingness to cede land for peace. The surveys excluded 10–12% of the population in occupied territories, and question wording significantly impacts results, as noted by Professor Jørgen Bølstad. - Additional Context: Leraand acknowledged the debate format limited her ability to clarify the survey’s nuances, but her claim overstated the support for ceding land.

Conclusion: Mixed. It is true that a majority (52%) of Ukrainians surveyed by Gallup want peace negotiations as soon as possible. However, it is false that a majority of Ukrainians support giving up territory to achieve peace. Only those who supported negotiations were asked about territorial concessions, and among them, 52% said they would accept giving up land—meaning this view represents only a subset of the total population. Therefore, Leraand's statement misrepresents the broader survey results.;1. Claim being assessed: Marielle Leraand’s claim that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations even if it means giving up parts of the country. 2. Verdict: Mixed 3. Reasoning/Evidence:  It is true that a majority (52%) of Ukrainians surveyed want to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible.  However, only those who supported negotiations were asked if they would accept giving up land, and among them, 52% agreed to territorial concessions. This does not represent a majority of all Ukrainians, only of the subgroup wanting negotiations.  Additionally, 38% of the overall population still support continuing to fight until victory.  Independent surveys (e.g., KIIS) show similar patterns, with a majority opposed to giving up land.  The fact-check highlights that the wording and context of the questions are crucial, and the claim oversimplifies complex survey results.;Ukrainian Desire for Peace Negotiations: Majority Wants Talks (True), But Willingness to Cede Land is Mixed.;Assertion: Marielle Leraand, leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), claimed during NRK's Debatten on May 20 that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country, based on a Gallup World Poll conducted in August and October 2024. Conclusion: Mixed. It is true that the Gallup poll found a majority of Ukrainians (52 percent) want Ukraine to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible. This marks a shift from previous Gallup surveys in 2022 (73 percent wanted to continue fighting) and 2023 (63 percent). However, it is false that the majority of all Ukrainians surveyed said they wanted to give up land. The question about giving up land was only asked to the 52 percent who responded that they wanted peace negotiations. Of this specific group, 52 percent responded that they wanted to give up land in negotiations, while 38 percent did not, and nine percent were unsure or refrained. This means that only approximately 27% (52% of 52%) of the total surveyed population expressed a willingness to give up land for peace. Therefore, while a majority desired peace negotiations, it's not accurate to claim a majority of all Ukrainians surveyed were willing to cede territory. The nuances of the survey questions and the specific subgroups asked are crucial to the interpretation. The fact-check also notes consistency with other surveys, like KIIS, which indicated around 38 percent are willing to give up land for a quick peace agreement, while 51 percent are not.;Here's the verdict for the fact-check: 1. What is the claim being assessed? Marielle Leraand, leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), claimed that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations even if it means giving up parts of the country, based on a Gallup opinion poll. 2. What is the verdict (true/false/mixed)? Mixed. 3. What reasoning or evidence supports the conclusion?  True Part: The Gallup poll (conducted August-October 2024, published November 2024) does show that over half (52 percent) of those surveyed wanted Ukraine to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible. This represents a significant shift from previous Gallup surveys in 2022 (73% favored continuing to fight) and 2023 (63% favored continuing to fight).  False Part: It is not true that a majority of all Ukrainians surveyed said they wanted to give up land. The question about giving up land was only posed to the subgroup of respondents (52% of the total) who had already indicated a desire for peace negotiations. Of this subgroup, 52 percent did respond that they wanted to give up land in negotiations. However, 38 percent of this subgroup did not want to give up land, and 9 percent were unsure. This means that only approximately 27% (52% of the 52% who wanted negotiations) of the total surveyed population explicitly expressed a willingness to cede territory for peace.  Supporting Nuance: The fact-check also highlights that 38 percent of the total surveyed population still believed Ukraine should continue fighting until it wins. Professor Jørgen Bølstad of the University of Oslo also points out that other surveys, such as those from the Kyiv Institute of Sociology (KIIS), indicate around 38 percent are willing to give up land for a quick peace agreement, while 51 percent are not, reinforcing that the wording of questions is crucial and the desire for peace does not automatically equate to a willingness to concede territory.;Claim About Ukrainians Backing Land Concessions for Peace is Mixed;Assertion: Marielle Leraand, leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), claimed that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country, based on a Gallup opinion poll. Conclusion: The verdict is Mixed. The claim is partially true in that over half (52%) of those surveyed want Ukraine to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible. However, it's not true that a majority of Ukrainians want to give up land. Among those who supported negotiations, 52% were willing to give up land, while 38% were not, and 9% were unsure. To understand the full picture, it's crucial to consider the survey's nuances and the context of a country at war, where opinions on peace terms can be complex and varied ¹.;"Fact-Check Verdict Claim being assessed: Marielle Leraand claimed that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country, based on a Gallup opinion poll. Verdict: Mixed Reasoning/Evidence: It's true that over half (52%) of those surveyed want Ukraine to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible. However, the claim that a majority want to give up land is not supported; among those who wanted peace negotiations, 52% were willing to give up land (which doesn't represent a majority of all surveyed), while 38% of all respondents wanted to continue fighting until Ukraine wins the war. The survey's nuances and the context of a war zone are crucial for understanding the results.

Conclusion: The claim is partially true. The Gallup poll from August and October 2024, published in November 2024, confirms that 52% of respondents wanted Ukraine to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible, supporting the first part of Leraand’s claim. However, the claim that a majority want to give up land is false. Only 52% of those who favored negotiations (not the entire survey sample) supported giving up land, while 38% opposed it, and 9% were unsure. Additionally, 38% of all respondents preferred continuing to fight until victory, and surveys from the Kyiv Institute of Sociology (KIIS) indicate 51% are unwilling to cede land for peace. The surveys’ limitations, such as excluding occupied territories and the timing of the data, further contextualize the findings. Leraand’s claim oversimplifies the nuanced survey results, particularly regarding territorial concessions.;1. Claim Being Assessed: Marielle Leraand, leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), claimed during NRK's Debatten on May 20 that a Gallup poll showed a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country. 2. Verdict: Mixed. 3. Reasoning and Evidence: The Gallup poll conducted in August and October 2024, published in November 2024, supports part of Leraand’s claim: 52% of respondents favored Ukraine entering peace negotiations as soon as possible. However, the claim that a majority want to give up land is false. The poll shows that only 52% of those who supported negotiations (not the entire sample) were willing to cede land, with 38% opposing it and 9% unsure. Additionally, 38% of all respondents preferred continuing to fight until victory, a decline from 73% in 2022 and 63% in 2023. Surveys from the Kyiv Institute of Sociology (KIIS) corroborate that 51% are unwilling to give up land for peace. The surveys’ limitations, such as excluding occupied territories (10–12% of the population) and the timing of the data, add nuance. Leraand’s claim inaccurately implies broad support for territorial concessions, misrepresenting the poll’s findings.
FC_12;Assertion;Is it true that over half of Ukrainians would give up land for peace?;Assertion The majority of the Ukrainian population now says, according to Gallup, that they want an end to the war. They want peace negotiations, cede territories, rather than continue this war. Conclusion It is true, according to the 2024 poll, that 52 percent of the population wants peace negotiations to end the war as soon as possible. However, it is not true that half the population wants to cede territories. The survey only asked respondents who already wanted peace negotiations whether they were open to ceding territories. Here again, 52 percent answered yes.;This is the fact-check: During NRK's ​​Debatten on May 20, the leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), Marielle Leraand, brought up an opinion poll conducted by the American analysis agency Gallup . The agency regularly conducts surveys in Ukraine as part of its World Poll .Leraand claimed that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country.We have reviewed the numbers to find out if her claim is true.It is true that over half (52 percent) of those surveyed said they wanted Ukraine to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible.However, it is not true that the majority have said they want to give up land. The survey only asked the question of whether Ukraine should give up land to those who responded that they wanted peace negotiations. Of these, 52 percent responded that they wanted to give up land in negotiations. 38 percent responded that they did not want this, and nine percent were unsure or refrained from answering.When asked first whether Ukraine should negotiate or continue fighting, 38 percent said the country should continue fighting until it wins the war. This is a decrease from Gallup's previous surveys from 2023 and 2022. In 2022, 73 percent were in favor of continuing to fight, and 63 percent said the same in 2023.Both VG and NRK have investigated several of the allegations that emerged during the Debate.The Gallup poll was conducted in August and October 2024, with the figures published in November of the same year. It is reported that the agency is unable to conduct the surveys in occupied territories due to lack of coverage by Ukrainian telecom operators. This means that approximately 10–12 percent of the population is excluded from the surveys.The agency has regularly conducted surveys in Ukraine. In an article, they explain the challenges involved in conducting surveys in a war zone .Professor at the Department of Political Science at the University of Oslo, Jørgen Bølstad, tells Faktisk.no that even though the surveys were conducted in a country at war, we can read something from them.Bølstad also explains that there is consistency between the surveys from Gallup and other surveys, including those from the Kyiv Institute of Sociology  (KIIS).– Findings from KIIS indicate that around 38 percent are willing to give up land to get a quick peace agreement, while 51 percent are not, says Bølstad.– This also illustrates that the wording of the questions is absolutely crucial. It is not surprising that a people at war can imagine peace. The big question is what kind of peace they want, and at what price. It is unlikely that many people want the West to stop sending aid.He also says that it is important to take into account that the surveys were conducted a few months ago, and that things may have changed in the meantime.– Difficult to explain all the detailsFOR leader Marielle Leraand writes in an email to Faktisk.no that the format of the Debate made it difficult to explain all the details of the survey.– The answer options in the survey were “Ukraine should continue fighting until it wins the war”. 38 percent thought this. The Norwegian public has created the impression that an overwhelming majority of Ukrainians will continue to fight.– But 52 percent thought that: “Ukraine should seek to negotiate an ending to the war as soon as possible”. That is what we in FOR think. We do not have a specific opinion about what the negotiation result should be.;Least-to-most ;Majority of Ukrainians Want Peace Talks, But Not Majority Ready to Give Up Land;Assertion: Marielle Leraand, leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), claimed that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country. Conclusion: The claim is partly true but misleading. It is correct that 52% of Ukrainians surveyed want to start peace negotiations soon. However, it is not true that a majority want to give up land—only 52% of those wanting negotiations (which is about half of that group) were willing to concede land, meaning overall fewer than half support giving up territory. The survey also showed 38% want to continue fighting until victory. The wording of questions and the survey’s timing affect interpretation, and similar surveys show consistent results. The complexity and nuances mean Leraand’s simplified claim doesn’t capture the full picture.;1. What is the claim? Marielle Leraand claimed that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country. 2. What is the final verdict? The claim is partially true but misleading. While a majority want peace negotiations, it is not true that a majority support giving up land. 3. What evidence supports this verdict?  52% of surveyed Ukrainians want to enter peace negotiations soon.  Only 52% of that subgroup (those wanting negotiations) are willing to give up land, which is roughly half of half, so not a majority overall.  38% want to continue fighting until victory.  Other surveys (e.g., Kyiv Institute of Sociology) align with these findings, showing similar splits in opinion.  The survey excluded occupied territories (about 10–12% of the population), which may affect results.  Experts emphasize that question wording and timing influence responses, highlighting complexity beyond the simplified claim.;Claim of Majority Ukrainian Support for Peace-With-Land-Concessions: Mixed Verdict, Key Detail Misrepresented;Assertion: Marielle Leraand, leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), claimed during NRK's Debatten on May 20 that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country, citing a Gallup poll. Conclusion: The claim is partially true but mostly false based on the evidence presented.  Verdict (Partially True): It is true that 52 percent of those surveyed by Gallup wanted Ukraine to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible.  Verdict (Mostly False): It is not true that a majority of all Ukrainians surveyed expressed a willingness to give up land. The question about giving up land was only asked to the 52 percent who wanted peace negotiations. Of that subset, 52 percent (which is 27% of the total respondents) were willing to give up land.  Further Evidence:  38 percent of the total respondents stated Ukraine should continue fighting until it wins, a decrease from previous years (73% in 2022, 63% in 2023).  Surveys were conducted in August and October 2024, excluding occupied territories.  Consistency with other surveys like KIIS, which found around 38 percent willing to give up land for quick peace, and 51 percent not.  Experts emphasize the crucial role of question wording and the difference between wanting peace and defining its terms.;Here's the breakdown of the fact-check:What is the claim?Marielle Leraand, leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), claimed that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country.What is the final verdict?The claim is partially true but misleading. While a majority of Ukrainians do want peace negotiations, it is not true that a majority of all Ukrainians surveyed want to give up land.What evidence supports this verdict?Evidence for majority want peace negotiations: A Gallup poll conducted in August and October 2024 found that 52% of Ukrainians surveyed wanted their country to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible.Evidence against majority want to give up land:The question about giving up land was only asked to the 52% who had already expressed a desire for peace negotiations. Of this subgroup, 52% said they were willing to give up land. This means only a portion of the overall population surveyed expressed this willingness.When asked whether Ukraine should negotiate or continue fighting, 38% of all respondents said the country should continue fighting until it wins the war.This overall picture is consistent with other surveys, such as those from the Kyiv Institute of Sociology (KIIS), which indicate that around 38% are willing to give up land for a quick peace agreement, while 51% are not.The fact-check also highlights that the wording of questions is crucial and that surveys could not be conducted in occupied territories (10-12% of the population).;Partial Truth in Claim That Ukrainians Want Peace at Any Price;Assertion: The main claim made by Marielle Leraand, leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), is that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country. Conclusion: The verdict is that Leraand's claim is partially true. Evidence shows that over half (52%) of Ukrainians surveyed by Gallup want Ukraine to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible. However, it's not true that a majority of Ukrainians want to give up land. Among those who support peace negotiations, 52% would accept territorial compromises, but this doesn't represent a majority of all surveyed Ukrainians.

Conclusion: The claim is partially true. The Gallup poll from August and October 2024, published in November 2024, confirms that 52% of respondents favored Ukraine entering peace negotiations as soon as possible. However, the claim that a majority want to give up land is inaccurate.

Final Verdict: The claim is partially true. It is accurate that a majority (52%) of Ukrainians surveyed by Gallup supported peace negotiations as soon as possible. However, the claim that a majority want to give up land is false, as only 52% of those favoring negotiations (not the entire sample) supported ceding land. 3. Evidence Supporting the Verdict: - Gallup Poll Data: Conducted in August and October 2024, published in November 2024, the poll found 52% of respondents wanted Ukraine to negotiate peace quickly, while 38% favored continuing to fight until victory. This is a shift from 73% in 2022 and 63% in 2023 supporting continued fighting. - Land Concession Question: The question about giving up land was only asked of those who supported negotiations. Of these, 52% agreed to ceding land, 38% opposed it, and 9% were unsure, meaning no overall majority supported giving up land. - Poll Limitations: The survey excluded occupied territories (10–12% of Ukraine’s population) due to lack of telecom coverage, potentially skewing results. - Corroboration: Professor Jørgen Bølstad noted consistency with other surveys, like those from the Kyiv Institute of Sociology, which found 38% willing to cede land for peace and 51% opposed. - Context: Bølstad highlighted that question wording and timing (surveys conducted months earlier) influence results. Leraand noted the debate format limited her ability to clarify the survey’s details.

Mixed — The claim is partially true but also misleading. 3. What evidence supports this decision?  Survey data show that 52% of Ukrainians want peace negotiations as soon as possible, confirming the first part of the claim.  However, only among those who want negotiations, 52% are willing to give up land. This group represents a smaller portion of the overall population, meaning it is incorrect to say a majority of all Ukrainians want to give up territory.  Additionally, 38% of Ukrainians still support continuing the fight until victory.  Other surveys (e.g., from Kyiv Institute of Sociology) corroborate these mixed attitudes, highlighting the importance of question wording and the complexity of public opinion during wartime.  The survey excludes occupied territories and was conducted several months ago, which may affect representativeness and current relevance.;Fact Check: Norwegian Politician's Claim on Ukrainian Peace Poll Mixed Verdict: While a recent Gallup poll shows a majority of Ukrainians now desire peace talks, the claim that a majority are willing to cede territory for peace is false.;Assertion: Marielle Leraand, leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), claimed during NRK's Debatten on May 20 that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country, citing a Gallup World Poll. Conclusion: Mixed. The claim is partially true regarding the desire for peace negotiations but false regarding the majority's willingness to cede land.  True Part: The Gallup poll, conducted in August and October 2024 and published in November 2024, indeed found that 52% of those surveyed wanted Ukraine to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible. This represents a significant shift from previous Gallup surveys in 2022 (73%) and 2023 (63%) where a majority favored continuing to fight.  False Part: Leraand's assertion that a majority of Ukrainians want to give up land is incorrect. The survey only asked the question of territorial concessions to the 52% who had already stated they wanted peace negotiations. Of that subgroup, 52% (which is 52% of 52% of the total surveyed, approximately 27% of the total) responded that they were willing to give up land in negotiations.

The survey's question about giving up land was only posed to the subgroup of respondents (the initial 52%) who had already indicated a desire for peace negotiations. Of this specific subgroup, 52% were open to territorial concessions. This means that only approximately 27% (52% of 52%) of the overall surveyed population expressed willingness to give up land.

Conclusion: The verdict is Mixed. The evidence supports that 52% of Ukrainians surveyed want Ukraine to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible. However, it's not true that a majority have said they want to give up land. Among those who want peace negotiations, 52% are willing to give up land, while 38% are not, and 9% are unsure. This translates to roughly 27% of the total respondents (52% of 52%) willing to give up land for peace negotiations, not a majority of the total respondents.

Claim: Marielle Leraand claimed that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country. 2. Verdict: False/Misleading. While a majority (52%) of Ukrainians surveyed want Ukraine to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible, the evidence does not support that a majority of Ukrainians are willing to give up land to achieve peace. 3. Evidence: 52% of respondents want Ukraine to seek peace negotiations, but this does not necessarily mean giving up land. Among those who want peace negotiations (52% of respondents), 52% are willing to give up land, 38% are not, and 9% are unsure.

Conclusion The claim is partially true. The Gallup poll conducted in August and October 2024 confirms that 52 percent of respondents favored Ukraine entering peace negotiations as soon as possible, supporting Leraand’s claim about a majority wanting negotiations. However, her assertion that the majority want to give up land is misleading. The poll indicates that only among those who supported negotiations (52 percent of the total sample), 52 percent were willing to cede land, which translates to roughly 27 percent of the overall population surveyed. Meanwhile, 38 percent of the total respondents preferred continuing to fight until victory, and 38 percent of negotiation supporters opposed giving up land. The claim overstates the willingness to cede territory, as it does not reflect a majority of all Ukrainians but a subset of those favoring negotiations. Additionally, the poll’s limitations, such as excluding 10–12 percent of the population in occupied territories and potential changes in sentiment since the survey, add context to interpreting the results. Consistency with other surveys, like those from the Kyiv Institute of Sociology, further suggests varied public opinion on territorial concessions.;Fact-Check Summary Claim: Marielle Leraand, leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), stated during NRK's Debatten on May 20 that a Gallup poll showed a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country. Verdict: Partially true. Evidence Supporting the Decision: The Gallup poll, conducted in August and October 2024 and published in November 2024, found that 52 percent of respondents supported Ukraine entering peace negotiations as soon as possible, confirming Leraand’s claim about a majority favoring negotiations. However, the claim that a majority want to give up land is misleading. The poll asked about ceding land only to those who supported negotiations (52 percent of the total sample). Of this group, 52 percent were willing to give up land, equating to approximately 27 percent of the overall surveyed population, not a majority. Meanwhile, 38 percent of negotiation supporters opposed ceding land, and 9 percent were unsure. Additionally, 38 percent of all respondents favored continuing to fight until victory, a decline from 73 percent in 2022 and 63 percent in 2023, indicating shifting sentiments. The poll’s limitations include its exclusion of 10–12 percent of the population in occupied territories due to lack of telecom coverage, which may skew results. Supporting evidence from the Kyiv Institute of Sociology (KIIS) shows 38 percent willingness to cede land for peace, with 51 percent opposed, aligning with Gallup’s findings and highlighting the importance of question wording. Professor Jørgen Bølstad noted that while surveys in war zones have challenges, they remain informative, though public opinion may have shifted since the survey period. Leraand acknowledged the debate format limited her ability to clarify details, but her claim overstates the extent of support for territorial concessions.
FC_12;Assertion;Is it true that over half of Ukrainians would give up land for peace?;Assertion The majority of the Ukrainian population now says, according to Gallup, that they want an end to the war. They want peace negotiations, cede territories, rather than continue this war. Conclusion It is true, according to the 2024 poll, that 52 percent of the population wants peace negotiations to end the war as soon as possible. However, it is not true that half the population wants to cede territories. The survey only asked respondents who already wanted peace negotiations whether they were open to ceding territories. Here again, 52 percent answered yes.;This is the fact-check: During NRK's ​​Debatten on May 20, the leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), Marielle Leraand, brought up an opinion poll conducted by the American analysis agency Gallup . The agency regularly conducts surveys in Ukraine as part of its World Poll .Leraand claimed that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country.We have reviewed the numbers to find out if her claim is true.It is true that over half (52 percent) of those surveyed said they wanted Ukraine to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible.However, it is not true that the majority have said they want to give up land. The survey only asked the question of whether Ukraine should give up land to those who responded that they wanted peace negotiations. Of these, 52 percent responded that they wanted to give up land in negotiations. 38 percent responded that they did not want this, and nine percent were unsure or refrained from answering.When asked first whether Ukraine should negotiate or continue fighting, 38 percent said the country should continue fighting until it wins the war. This is a decrease from Gallup's previous surveys from 2023 and 2022. In 2022, 73 percent were in favor of continuing to fight, and 63 percent said the same in 2023.Both VG and NRK have investigated several of the allegations that emerged during the Debate.The Gallup poll was conducted in August and October 2024, with the figures published in November of the same year. It is reported that the agency is unable to conduct the surveys in occupied territories due to lack of coverage by Ukrainian telecom operators. This means that approximately 10–12 percent of the population is excluded from the surveys.The agency has regularly conducted surveys in Ukraine. In an article, they explain the challenges involved in conducting surveys in a war zone .Professor at the Department of Political Science at the University of Oslo, Jørgen Bølstad, tells Faktisk.no that even though the surveys were conducted in a country at war, we can read something from them.Bølstad also explains that there is consistency between the surveys from Gallup and other surveys, including those from the Kyiv Institute of Sociology  (KIIS).– Findings from KIIS indicate that around 38 percent are willing to give up land to get a quick peace agreement, while 51 percent are not, says Bølstad.– This also illustrates that the wording of the questions is absolutely crucial. It is not surprising that a people at war can imagine peace. The big question is what kind of peace they want, and at what price. It is unlikely that many people want the West to stop sending aid.He also says that it is important to take into account that the surveys were conducted a few months ago, and that things may have changed in the meantime.– Difficult to explain all the detailsFOR leader Marielle Leraand writes in an email to Faktisk.no that the format of the Debate made it difficult to explain all the details of the survey.– The answer options in the survey were “Ukraine should continue fighting until it wins the war”. 38 percent thought this. The Norwegian public has created the impression that an overwhelming majority of Ukrainians will continue to fight.– But 52 percent thought that: “Ukraine should seek to negotiate an ending to the war as soon as possible”. That is what we in FOR think. We do not have a specific opinion about what the negotiation result should be.;Zero-shot;Majority of Ukrainians Want Peace Talks, But Not Necessarily to Give Up Land ;Assertion: Marielle Leraand, leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), claimed that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country. Conclusion: Mixed. It is true that a majority (52%) of Ukrainians surveyed want peace negotiations as soon as possible. However, it is false that a majority want to give up land—only 52% of those wanting negotiations (which is about half of the total) support giving up land, while 38% oppose it. Additional surveys (like KIIS) support similar results, showing the importance of question wording and context. The surveys exclude occupied territories and are a few months old, so the situation may have evolved.;1. What is the claim? Marielle Leraand claimed that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of Ukraine. 2. What is the final verdict? The claim is partly true and partly false (mixed). 3. What reasoning supports this decision?  It is true that a majority (52%) of Ukrainians surveyed want to start peace negotiations as soon as possible.  However, among those who want negotiations, only about half (52%) support giving up land, which does not translate to a clear majority of the total population.  A significant portion (38%) oppose giving up territory, and some are unsure.  Other surveys, like those from KIIS, show similar mixed opinions.  The survey excludes occupied areas and is a few months old, so it may not fully represent current opinions.  The wording of questions is critical, and the complexity of wartime opinions means simple claims can be misleading.;Ukrainians and Peace Talks: Majority Wants Negotiations, But Not All Support Ceding Land (Mixed Verdict);Assertion Marielle Leraand, leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), claimed during NRK's Debatten that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country. This claim was based on a Gallup opinion poll conducted in Ukraine. ---  Conclusion The verdict on Leraand's claim is mixed.  It is true that over half (52 percent) of those surveyed by Gallup said they wanted Ukraine to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible.  However, it is not true that the majority have said they want to give up land. The survey only asked about giving up land to those who already responded they wanted peace negotiations. Of these respondents, 52 percent (which is 52% of the 52% who want peace negotiations) indicated a willingness to cede territory, while 38 percent did not. Additional evidence supporting this conclusion includes:  When initially asked whether Ukraine should negotiate or continue fighting, 38 percent said the country should continue fighting until it wins the war. This shows a significant portion still prefers continued conflict.  Professor Jørgen Bølstad from the University of Oslo noted consistency between Gallup's findings and other surveys, such as those from the Kyiv Institute of Sociology (KIIS). KIIS findings indicate that around 38 percent are willing to give up land for a quick peace agreement, while 51 percent are not, further highlighting that a majority do not want to give up land.  Bølstad emphasized that the wording of questions is crucial and that while people may desire peace, the price of that peace (i.e., giving up land) is a different matter.  The Gallup poll was conducted in August and October 2024, with results published in November 2024, and did not include occupied territories.;Here's the verdict for the fact-check: 1. What is the claim? Marielle Leraand, leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), claimed that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country. 2. What is the final verdict? Mixed. 3. What reasoning supports this decision?  True Part: The Gallup poll did find that 52 percent of Ukrainians surveyed want Ukraine to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible. This supports the first part of Leraand's claim that a majority desire peace talks.  False Part: The claim that a majority want to give up parts of the country is not supported by the full context of the poll. The question about giving up land was only asked to the 52 percent who expressed a desire for peace negotiations. Of that specific group, 52 percent were open to territorial concessions. This means that a majority of all Ukrainians do not necessarily support giving up land. Furthermore, 38 percent of the overall respondents stated they wanted to continue fighting until victory, and other surveys like KIIS show a strong majority (51%) are not willing to give up land for a quick peace agreement, and 81% believe Ukraine can succeed with Western support. The wording of the question is crucial, and the overall data does not indicate a majority of all Ukrainians are willing to cede territory.;Claim About Majority of Ukrainians Wanting to Give Up Land for Peace is Partially True, Partially False;Assertion: Marielle Leraand claimed that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country. Conclusion: The claim is partially true, but also partially false. The verdict is Mixed. Here's the evidence: 52% of Ukrainians surveyed by Gallup want Ukraine to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible, which supports Leraand's claim about wanting peace negotiations. However, among those who want peace negotiations, 52% are willing to give up land in negotiations, while 38% are not, and 9% are unsure. This doesn't constitute a majority of all Ukrainians surveyed wanting to give up land. Additionally, 38% of respondents want Ukraine to continue fighting until it wins the war, showing a divided opinion among Ukrainians. Professor Jørgen Bølstad notes that survey results from KIIS show around 38% are willing to give up land for a quick peace agreement, while 51% are not, further highlighting the complexity of Ukrainian public opinion ¹.;Claim: Marielle Leraand claimed that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country. Final Verdict: Partially True/ Mixed Reasoning: The claim is partially true because a majority (52%) of Ukrainians surveyed by Gallup do want Ukraine to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible. However, the claim is also partially false because it is not true that a majority of Ukrainians want to give up land. Among those who want peace negotiations, 52% are willing to give up land, but this doesn't represent a majority of all Ukrainians surveyed. The survey's results show divided opinions, and the claim misrepresents the nuances of the survey's findings. Meta AI response: Claim: Marielle Leraand claimed that a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country. Final Verdict: Partially True/ Mixed Reasoning: The claim is partially true because a majority (52%) of Ukrainians surveyed by Gallup do want Ukraine to enter peace negotiations as soon as possible. However, the claim is also partially false because it is not true that a majority of Ukrainians want to give up land. Among those who want peace negotiations, 52% are willing to give up land, but this doesn't represent a majority of all Ukrainians surveyed. The survey's results show divided opinions, and the claim misrepresents the nuances of the survey's findings.;Ukrainian Peace Talks Claim Partially True: Majority Favor Negotiations, But Not Land Concessions;Assertion: During NRK's Debatten on May 20, Marielle Leraand, leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), claimed that a Gallup poll showed a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country. Conclusion: The claim is mixed. - True: The Gallup poll (conducted August–October 2024, published November 2024) confirms 52% of Ukrainians surveyed wanted peace negotiations as soon as possible. - False: The claim that a majority want to give up land is incorrect. Only 52% of those who supported negotiations (not the entire sample) were willing to cede land, with 38% opposed and 9% unsure. The survey did not ask the entire sample about giving up land. - Supporting Evidence: - Gallup’s World Poll shows 38% favored continuing the fight until victory, down from 63% in 2023 and 73% in 2022. - The Kyiv Institute of Sociology (KIIS) found 38% willing to cede land for quick peace, with 51% opposed, aligning with Gallup’s findings. - Surveys exclude 10–12% of the population in occupied territories due to telecom limitations. - Professor Jørgen Bølstad notes consistency across surveys but highlights that question wording and timing affect results, and public sentiment may have shifted since the survey.;1. Claim: Marielle Leraand, leader of the Peace and Justice Party (FOR), stated during NRK's Debatten on May 20 that a Gallup poll showed a majority of Ukrainians want peace negotiations, even if it means giving up parts of the country. 2. Final Verdict: Mixed. 3. Reasoning: - True Aspect: The Gallup poll (conducted August–October 2024, published November 2024) confirms that 52% of Ukrainians surveyed supported entering peace negotiations as soon as possible, aligning with part of Leraand’s claim. - False Aspect: The claim that a majority of Ukrainians want to give up land is inaccurate. The Gallup poll only asked about ceding land to those who favored negotiations (52% of that group supported it, 38% opposed, 9% were unsure), not the entire sample. Thus, it does not represent a majority of all Ukrainians. - Supporting Evidence: - Additional data from the Kyiv Institute of Sociology (KIIS) shows 38% willingness to cede land for quick peace, with 51% opposed, consistent with Gallup’s findings. - The surveys exclude 10–12% of the population in occupied territories, and question wording and timing may influence results, as noted by Professor Jørgen Bølstad. - Leraand acknowledged the debate format limited her ability to clarify details, but her claim overstated the poll’s findings regarding land concessions.

It is safe to drink, and a water filter is not necessary. PFAS can occur in drinking water, but the levels are well below safe limits.;According to influencer and artist Thomas Thrap Huse (Pimp Lotion), and the company Vannrenser.no, Oslo's drinking water from Maridalen is so polluted that we are advised to purchase a water filter to purify our drinking water. TikTok user @vannrenser.no is apparently advertising the website of the same name , where you can purchase the filters. According to the website, the so-called reverse osmosis filter is supposed to remove absolutely all contaminants, which in turn can lead to increased energy levels and help us get rid of brain fog. The website Vannrenser.no mentions the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) several times on its website.

Steinberg clarifies above Faktisk.no what FHI's advice regarding drinking water is:  – It is not necessary to purify drinking water from a waterworks with a filter or other post-treatment. The vast majority of people get their drinking water from a waterworks, which treats the water so that it is safe to drink. But could there be something to be said for a water filter like Pimp Lotion claims in the video posted by the company?

This is done in accordance with the requirements set for water utility owners in the Drinking Water Regulations.– Found everywhereIn the aforementioned podcast, Thomas Thrap Huse focuses particularly on PFAS (see fact box) in drinking water as one of the main reasons why he believes it is wise to use a reverse osmosis filter. PFAS are substances that are very stable and are therefore referred to as forever chemicals. Cathrine Brecke Gundersen, who researches environmental chemicals at the Norwegian Institute for Water Research (NIVA), tells Faktisk.no. “PFAS are often added to the surface of a product and can be washed off during use and washing. Because PFAS have so many different uses, we find the substances almost everywhere, both outdoors and indoors,” says Gundersen.She points out that virtually all people have PFASs in their blood because some of these substances are found almost everywhere. We do not have thorough data on the harmful effects of all types of PFAS, but several types have been linked to harmful effects that can, among other things, disrupt the immune system, reduce the effectiveness of vaccines, inhibit fetal development and be carcinogenic. Very low levelsThe level of PFAS in drinking water has recently been investigated in Southern Norway, including in Maridalsvannet. Cathrine Brecke Gundersen has a PhD in environmental chemistry and is a researcher at the Norwegian Institute for Water Resources (NIVA). Photo: NIVA. – Not surprisingly, PFAS was found, but at low levels that are below the most stringent international drinking water limits. PFAS in drinking water from public waterworks in southern parts of Norway is low and therefore drinking water is not considered a significant source,  says Gundersen.This is also confirmed by Toril Giske from the Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration. At the same time, she says that it is true that PFAS can be found in some types of ski lubricant: – We regularly monitor water quality and analyze, among other things, for PFAS, which can be found in certain types of ski lubricant. When it comes to PFAS, we analyze quarterly for 17 different compounds at both of our raw water sources, Maridalsvannet and Elvåga. According to Giske, none of these compounds were detected in samples taken at Elvåga in 2024. – In samples from Maridalsvannet, we have found a few of these (3 out of 17), but these are very low values that are well below the prescribed limit value for PFAS compounds in the new drinking water regulations. Giske tells Faktisk.no that the water quality is safe and is continuously monitored.Drinking water not the main sourceShe says that the most important source of PFAS for humans is the food we eat. This is also stated by the EU's EFSA, which carries out risk assessments on the levels of PFAS that humans can ingest. Cathrine Brecke Gundersen at NIVA therefore believes that it is generally not necessary to use a reverse osmosis filter in Norway. – To reduce exposure to PFAS, it is recommended to be aware of which products you buy and surround yourself with. Products marked with the Nordic Ecolabel guarantee to be free of PFAS, says Gundersen.The researcher believes that places where such a filter might be appropriate are at private water sources, such as a well, located near a firefighting training area or at places where PFAS has previously been produced. But Gundersen adds that the water utility is responsible for ensuring that public water supplies are of sufficiently good quality.;Vanilla;Oslo’s Drinking Water Is Safe — No Need for Reverse Osmosis Filters, Fact-Check Finds;Assertion: The main claim being evaluated is that Oslo’s drinking water from Maridalen is so polluted—especially with harmful PFAS chemicals—that residents should buy reverse osmosis water filters (such as those sold by Vannrenser.no) to purify their water and improve health by removing all contaminants. Conclusion: The fact-check finds the claim to be false and misleading. Oslo’s drinking water, including from Maridalsvannet, is safe, regularly tested, and meets all regulatory standards. PFAS chemicals are detected only at very low levels well below safety limits, and drinking water is not considered a significant source of PFAS exposure. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health and Water and Sewage Administration advise that no filtration is necessary for public water supplies. The company’s use of FHI’s name and logo was inappropriate and has been moderated following requests. Overall, the water quality is good, and the advertised filters are not necessary for the general population.;The verdict for the fact-check is False. The claim that Oslo’s drinking water from Maridalen is so polluted that people need to buy reverse osmosis filters to purify it is not supported by evidence. The water is safe, well-regulated, and contains only very low, safe levels of contaminants like PFAS.;Claim That Oslo's Drinking Water Is Polluted and Needs Filtering Is False;Assertion: Influencer Thomas Thrap Huse (Pimp Lotion) and the company Vannrenser.no claim that Oslo's drinking water from Maridalen is so polluted, particularly with PFAS, that it necessitates the purchase of a reverse osmosis filter to purify it, leading to benefits like increased energy and reduced brain fog. Conclusion: The claim is false. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) and the Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration confirm that Oslo's drinking water from Maridalen is safe, meets all drinking water regulations, and does not require additional filtering. While PFAS are present in the environment and in Oslo's water, the levels are very low, well below international limits, and drinking water is not considered a significant source of PFAS exposure for humans. FHI explicitly states that it is not necessary to purify public drinking water with a filter. Vannrenser.no has also been asked by FHI to moderate its references to the institute due to misleading impressions.;The verdict for the fact-check is False.;False Alarm: Oslo's Drinking Water Not in Need of Extra Filtering;Assertion: The main claim being evaluated is that Oslo's drinking water from Maridalen is so polluted that it's necessary to purchase a water filter to purify it, as claimed by influencer Thomas Thrap Huse (Pimp Lotion) and the company Vannrenser.no. Conclusion: The verdict of the fact-check is that this claim is unfounded. According to the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) and the Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration, Oslo's drinking water is safe and meets all requirements. While PFAS substances are found in the water, the levels are very low and below international drinking water limits. Experts agree that using a reverse osmosis filter is not necessary for public water supplies, and the main source of PFAS exposure is food, not drinking water.;Based on the fact-check, the verdict would be: False. The claim that Oslo's drinking water from Maridalen is so polluted that it's necessary to purchase a water filter to purify it is deemed false because: The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) states that it's not necessary to purify drinking water from a waterworks with a filter or other post-treatment. The Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration confirms that the drinking water in Oslo is safe and meets all requirements. Experts find that while PFAS substances are present in the water, the levels are very low and below international drinking water limits. Overall, the evidence suggests that the claim is unfounded and misleading.;Oslo's Drinking Water Safe, No Filter Needed Despite Claims, Fact-Check Finds;Assertion: Influencer Thomas Thrap Huse (Pimp Lotion) and Vannrenser.no claim that Oslo's drinking water from Maridalen is so polluted, particularly with PFAS, that a reverse osmosis filter is necessary to purify it, citing benefits like increased energy and reduced brain fog. The website references the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) to support its claims. Conclusion: The fact-check concludes that the claim is misleading and not supported by evidence. Oslo's drinking water, including from Maridalsvannet, is safe and meets all regulatory standards, as confirmed by the Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration through frequent testing. PFAS levels in the water are very low, well below international limits, and drinking water is not a significant source of PFAS exposure compared to food. FHI has stated that no additional purification is needed for water from public waterworks, and they have asked Vannrenser.no to remove their logo and moderate references to avoid misrepresentation. Experts, including Cathrine Brecke Gundersen from NIVA, note that reverse osmosis filters are unnecessary for public water supplies in Norway, though they may be relevant for private wells near contaminated sites.;Verdict: False The claim that Oslo's drinking water from Maridalen is so polluted that a reverse osmosis filter is necessary is false. Oslo's drinking water meets all regulatory standards, with very low PFAS levels well below international limits, as confirmed by the Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration and NIVA. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) states no additional purification is needed for public water supplies, and drinking water is not a significant source of PFAS exposure.

Claim being verified: Oslo’s drinking water from Maridalen is so polluted that people need to buy reverse osmosis filters (like those sold by Vannrenser.no) to remove contaminants such as PFAS and improve health. 2. Final verdict: False / Misleading 3. Evidence and reasoning supporting the verdict:  The Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration confirms Oslo’s drinking water is safe and regularly tested to meet strict standards.  PFAS levels detected in Maridalen water are very low, below stringent international limits, and not considered a significant source of exposure.  The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) requested removal of their logo and references from Vannrenser.no’s site because the company’s claims misrepresent FHI’s stance.  Experts agree reverse osmosis filtration is unnecessary for public water supplies in Norway and only recommended for private water sources with known contamination.  The main source of PFAS exposure for humans is food, not drinking water. --- If you want, I can help draft a short summary for easy sharing too!;Claim that Oslo's Tap Water is Polluted and Needs Filters is False;"Assertion: Influencer Thomas Thrap Huse (Pimp Lotion) and the company Vannrenser.no claim that Oslo's drinking water from Maridalen is so polluted, particularly with PFAS, that a water filter (specifically a reverse osmosis filter) is necessary to purify it. They assert that this purification can lead to increased energy and reduced brain fog. Conclusion: False. Oslo's drinking water from Maridalen is safe to drink and meets all requirements in the drinking water regulations. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) states that it is not necessary to purify drinking water from a waterworks with a filter. Tests conducted weekly and quarterly by the Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration consistently show that the water quality is high and levels of PFAS in Maridalsvannet are very low, well below prescribed limits. Experts from FHI and NIVA confirm that drinking water is not a significant source of PFAS exposure for humans; food is the main source. Therefore, there is no scientific basis to support the claim that a water filter is needed for Oslo's public drinking water.";"1. What is the claim being verified? The claim being verified is that Oslo's drinking water from Maridalen is so polluted, particularly with PFAS, that it necessitates the purchase of a water filter (specifically a reverse osmosis filter) to purify it, which can then lead to health benefits like increased energy and reduced brain fog. This claim is promoted by influencer Thomas Thrap Huse (Pimp Lotion) and the company Vannrenser.no. 2. What is the final verdict (true/false/mixed)? False. 3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict?  Safety of Public Water Supply: The Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration confirms that Oslo's drinking water, including from Maridalsvannet, is safe, meets all requirements in drinking water regulations, and is subject to frequent testing (weekly at treatment plants and in the network, quarterly for PFAS).  Expert Opinion (FHI): The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) explicitly states that it is not necessary to purify drinking water from a waterworks with a filter or other post-treatment because waterworks treat the water to be safe to drink. FHI also asked Vannrenser.no to remove references and its logo due to misleading content.  PFAS Levels are Low: Researchers from the Norwegian Institute for Water Research (NIVA) and the Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration confirm that while PFAS are present in Maridalsvannet, the levels are very low and well below the prescribed limit value for PFAS compounds in the new drinking water regulations.  Drinking Water Not Primary Source of PFAS: Experts state that drinking water is not considered a significant source of PFAS exposure for humans; the most important source of PFAS for humans is the food we eat.  No General Need for Filters: Cathrine Brecke Gundersen from NIVA believes it is generally not necessary to use a reverse osmosis filter in Norway for public water supplies, suggesting they might only be appropriate for specific private water sources near known contamination sites.";False: No Need for Water Filters for Oslo's Tap Water ;Assertion: The claim being verified is that Oslo's drinking water from Maridalen is so polluted that it's necessary to purchase a water filter to purify it, as claimed by influencer Thomas Thrap Huse (Pimp Lotion) and the company Vannrenser.no. Conclusion: The verdict is False. The key evidence that led to this conclusion is: The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) states that it's not necessary to purify drinking water from a waterworks with a filter or other post-treatment. The Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration confirms that Oslo's drinking water is safe and meets all requirements, with frequent tests conducted to ensure high quality. Researchers from the Norwegian Institute for Water Research (NIVA) found low levels of PFAS in Maridalsvannet, but below the most stringent international drinking water limits, and consider drinking water not to be a significant source of PFAS exposure.

Vannrenser.no also references the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) to support its claims. Conclusion: False. The claims are not supported by evidence. The Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration and FHI confirm that Oslo's drinking water, including from Maridalsvannet, is safe, meets regulatory standards, and undergoes frequent testing. PFAS levels in Maridalsvannet are very low, well below international limits, and drinking water is not a significant source of PFAS exposure. FHI has distanced itself from Vannrenser.no, requesting removal of its logo and references due to misleading use. Experts, including NIVA researcher Cathrine Brecke Gundersen, state that reverse osmosis filters are generally unnecessary for public water supplies in Norway, as food, not water, is the primary PFAS exposure source.;1. Claim being verified: Influencer Thomas Thrap Huse (Pimp Lotion) and Vannrenser.no claim that Oslo's drinking water from Maridalen is heavily polluted, particularly with PFAS, requiring a reverse osmosis filter to purify it for safe consumption, with purported benefits like increased energy and reduced brain fog. Vannrenser.no also references the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) to bolster its claims. 2. Final verdict: False. 3. Evidence and reasoning: - Water quality assurance: The Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration, through Toril Giske, confirms that Oslo's drinking water, including from Maridalsvannet, is safe and complies with drinking water regulations. Weekly sampling and quarterly PFAS testing show either no detectable PFAS or levels well below regulatory limits. - Expert testimony: Cathrine Brecke Gundersen from the Norwegian Institute for Water Research (NIVA) states that PFAS levels in Maridalsvannet are low and not a significant exposure source compared to food, as confirmed by the EU's EFSA. She notes that reverse osmosis filters are generally unnecessary for public water supplies in Norway. - FHI’s stance: FHI, through senior advisor Marianne Steinberg, clarifies that drinking water from public waterworks does not require purification. FHI requested Vannrenser.no to remove its logo and moderate references, as they were misleading and gave a false impression of FHI’s endorsement. - Misleading claims: The claims about health benefits like increased energy and reduced brain fog lack scientific backing, and the focus on PFAS in drinking water exaggerates its significance relative to other exposure sources like food.

It is safe to drink, and a water filter is not necessary. PFAS can occur in drinking water, but the levels are well below safe limits.;According to influencer and artist Thomas Thrap Huse (Pimp Lotion), and the company Vannrenser.no, Oslo's drinking water from Maridalen is so polluted that we are advised to purchase a water filter to purify our drinking water. TikTok user @vannrenser.no is apparently advertising the website of the same name , where you can purchase the filters. According to the website, the so-called reverse osmosis filter is supposed to remove absolutely all contaminants, which in turn can lead to increased energy levels and help us get rid of brain fog.

PFAS are substances that are very stable and are therefore referred to as forever chemicals. Cathrine Brecke Gundersen, who researches environmental chemicals at the Norwegian Institute for Water Research (NIVA), tells Faktisk.no. “PFAS are often added to the surface of a product and can be washed off during use and washing. Because PFAS have so many different uses, we find the substances almost everywhere, both outdoors and indoors,” says Gundersen.She points out that virtually all people have PFASs in their blood because some of these substances are found almost everywhere. We do not have thorough data on the harmful effects of all types of PFAS, but several types have been linked to harmful effects that can, among other things, disrupt the immune system, reduce the effectiveness of vaccines, inhibit fetal development and be carcinogenic. Very low levelsThe level of PFAS in drinking water has recently been investigated in Southern Norway, including in Maridalsvannet. Cathrine Brecke Gundersen has a PhD in environmental chemistry and is a researcher at the Norwegian Institute for Water Resources (NIVA).

PFAS in drinking water from public waterworks in southern parts of Norway is low and therefore drinking water is not considered a significant source,  says Gundersen.This is also confirmed by Toril Giske from the Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration. At the same time, she says that it is true that PFAS can be found in some types of ski lubricant: – We regularly monitor water quality and analyze, among other things, for PFAS, which can be found in certain types of ski lubricant. When it comes to PFAS, we analyze quarterly for 17 different compounds at both of our raw water sources, Maridalsvannet and Elvåga. According to Giske, none of these compounds were detected in samples taken at Elvåga in 2024. – In samples from Maridalsvannet, we have found a few of these (3 out of 17), but these are very low values that are well below the prescribed limit value for PFAS compounds in the new drinking water regulations. Giske tells Faktisk.no that the water quality is safe and is continuously monitored.Drinking water not the main sourceShe says that the most important source of PFAS for humans is the food we eat. This is also stated by the EU's EFSA, which carries out risk assessments on the levels of PFAS that humans can ingest. Cathrine Brecke Gundersen at NIVA therefore believes that it is generally not necessary to use a reverse osmosis filter in Norway. – To reduce exposure to PFAS, it is recommended to be aware of which products you buy and surround yourself with. Products marked with the Nordic Ecolabel guarantee to be free of PFAS, says Gundersen.The researcher believes that places where such a filter might be appropriate are at private water sources, such as a well, located near a firefighting training area or at places where PFAS has previously been produced.

The company Vannrenser.no was asked to stop misleadingly referencing public health authorities, as their claims lack scientific support.;Here’s the verdict structured clearly: 1. Claim being assessed: Oslo’s drinking water from Maridalen is heavily polluted with contaminants like PFAS, so residents should buy reverse osmosis filters (sold by Vannrenser.no) to purify their drinking water and improve health. 2. Verdict: False. 3. Reasoning/evidence:  The Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration tests Oslo’s water weekly, confirming it meets all drinking water regulations and is safe.  PFAS levels detected in Maridalsvannet are very low, well below the strictest international limits, posing no significant health risk via drinking water.  The Norwegian Institute of Public Health does not recommend additional filtration of municipal water.  PFAS exposure mainly comes from food, not tap water.  Vannrenser.no was asked to remove misleading references to public health authorities, as their claims are not scientifically substantiated. Let me know if you want this in an even more concise or detailed format!;Oslo Drinking Water Pollution Claim: False;Assertion: Influencer Thomas Thrap Huse (Pimp Lotion) and the company Vannrenser.no claim that Oslo's drinking water from Maridalen is so polluted, particularly with PFAS, that a water filter (specifically a reverse osmosis filter) is necessary to purify it, leading to increased energy levels and reduced brain fog. Vannrenser.no also implies endorsement from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI). Conclusion: False. The claim that Oslo's drinking water is polluted and requires a filter is false. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) explicitly states that it is not necessary to purify drinking water from a waterworks with a filter, as it is already treated to be safe. The Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration confirms that Oslo's drinking water, including from Maridalsvannet, is safe, meets all regulatory requirements, and is frequently tested. While PFAS are present in the environment and in Maridalsvannet, the levels found are very low and well below stringent international drinking water limits. Experts from NIVA state that drinking water from public waterworks is not considered a significant source of PFAS, and the main source for humans is food. Furthermore, Vannrenser.no has been asked by FHI to remove references and logos that give a misleading impression of FHI's endorsement.;Here's the verdict for the fact-check: 1. What is the claim being assessed? Influencer Thomas Thrap Huse (Pimp Lotion) and the company Vannrenser.no claim that Oslo's drinking water from Maridalen is so polluted, particularly with PFAS, that a water filter (specifically a reverse osmosis filter) is necessary to purify it. They also suggest that using such a filter can lead to increased energy and alleviate brain fog. Vannrenser.no also implies endorsement from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI). 2. What is the verdict (true/false/mixed)? False. 3. What reasoning or evidence supports the conclusion?  Official Statements: The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) explicitly advises that it is not necessary to purify drinking water from a waterworks with a filter or other post-treatment because the water is already treated to be safe. Toril Giske, from the Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration, confirms that Oslo's drinking water, including from Maridalsvannet, is safe and meets all requirements in the drinking water regulations.  Testing and Monitoring: The Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration conducts weekly sampling at water treatment plants and in the pipeline network to ensure high water quality. For PFAS specifically, they analyze quarterly for 17 different compounds at their raw water sources.  PFAS Levels: While PFAS are detected in Maridalsvannet, they are at very low values that are well below the prescribed limit value for PFAS compounds in the new drinking water regulations. Cathrine Brecke Gundersen from NIVA confirms these are low levels that are below the most stringent international drinking water limits and states that drinking water from public waterworks in southern Norway is not considered a significant source of PFAS.  Main Source of PFAS: Experts like Cathrine Brecke Gundersen at NIVA and the EU's EFSA indicate that the most important source of PFAS for humans is the food we eat, not drinking water from public supplies.  FHI's Disassociation: Vannrenser.no used FHI's name and logo in a misleading way, implying endorsement. FHI has corresponded with the company, asking them to remove references and the logo because they give the wrong impression of what they inform about. Despite some moderation, FHI still believes the company has not fully complied.  Filter Necessity: Cathrine Brecke Gundersen at NIVA generally believes it is not necessary to use a reverse osmosis filter in Norway for public water supplies, suggesting it might only be appropriate for private water sources near specific contamination sites.;False: Claim that Oslo's drinking water requires filtering due to pollution;Assertion: The claim being assessed is that Oslo's drinking water from Maridalen is so polluted that it's advisable to purchase a water filter to purify drinking water, as claimed by influencer Thomas Thrap Huse (Pimp Lotion) and the company Vannrenser.no. Conclusion: The verdict is False. The evidence from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI), the Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration, and the Norwegian Institute for Water Research (NIVA) confirms that Oslo's drinking water is safe and meets all requirements. While PFAS substances are found in the water, the levels are very low and below international drinking water limits, making drinking water not a significant source of PFAS exposure. Experts recommend that using a reverse osmosis filter is not necessary for public water supplies, but may be considered for private water sources in specific circumstances.;Here is the verdict for the fact-check: Claim being assessed: The claim that Oslo's drinking water from Maridalen is so polluted that it's advisable to purchase a water filter to purify drinking water, as claimed by influencer Thomas Thrap Huse (Pimp Lotion) and the company Vannrenser.no.

Experts agree that using a reverse osmosis filter is not necessary for public water supplies, but may be considered for private water sources in specific circumstances. The company Vannrenser.no's references to FHI on their website were deemed misleading by FHI itself, and the company's claims do not provide a balanced or fact-based picture of water quality in Oslo.;Claim That Oslo’s Maridalen Drinking Water Is Polluted and Needs Filtering Proven False;Assertion: Influencer Thomas Thrap Huse (Pimp Lotion) and the company Vannrenser.no claim that Oslo's drinking water from Maridalen is so polluted, particularly with PFAS, that residents should purchase a reverse osmosis water filter to purify it, which they claim can remove all contaminants and improve energy levels and reduce brain fog. Conclusion: The claim is false. Evidence from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI), the Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration, and researcher Cathrine Brecke Gundersen at the Norwegian Institute for Water Research (NIVA) confirms that Oslo’s drinking water, including from Maridalsvannet, is safe and meets all regulatory requirements. Weekly testing ensures high water quality, and while low levels of PFAS were detected, they are well below international safety limits. Drinking water is not a significant source of PFAS exposure compared to food, and FHI states that filtering public water supplies is unnecessary. The claims about health benefits like increased energy and reduced brain fog lack scientific support. Additionally, FHI has distanced itself from Vannrenser.no, criticizing the company for misleading references to FHI on its website.;1. Claim Being Assessed: Influencer Thomas Thrap Huse (Pimp Lotion) and Vannrenser.no claim that Oslo's drinking water from Maridalen is heavily polluted, particularly with PFAS, necessitating the use of a reverse osmosis water filter to remove all contaminants, which they assert can boost energy levels and alleviate brain fog. 2. Verdict: False 3. Reasoning and Evidence: - Water Safety: The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) and the Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration confirm that Oslo’s drinking water, including from Maridalsvannet, is safe and complies with all drinking water regulations. Weekly testing at water treatment plants and pipelines ensures high quality. - PFAS Levels: Research by Cathrine Brecke Gundersen at the Norwegian Institute for Water Research (NIVA) shows that PFAS is present in Maridalsvannet but at very low levels, well below international safety limits. Drinking water is not a significant source of PFAS exposure compared to food, as supported by the EU’s EFSA risk assessments. - Health Claims: No scientific evidence supports the claim that reverse osmosis filters increase energy or reduce brain fog. FHI states that filtering public water supplies in Norway is unnecessary. - Misleading Marketing: FHI has criticized Vannrenser.no for misusing its name and logo, creating a false impression of endorsement. Despite requests to remove these references, the company only partially complied, further undermining its credibility. - Expert Consensus: Both FHI and NIVA experts, including Toril Giske and Cathrine Brecke Gundersen, emphasize that public water supplies in Norway, including Oslo’s, are safe without additional filtration, except in specific cases like private wells near contaminated sites.

Products marked with the Nordic Ecolabel guarantee to be free of PFAS, says Gundersen.The researcher believes that places where such a filter might be appropriate are at private water sources, such as a well, located near a firefighting training area or at places where PFAS has previously been produced. But Gundersen adds that the water utility is responsible for ensuring that public water supplies are of sufficiently good quality.;Role;Claim That Oslo’s Drinking Water Is Polluted and Requires Filters Is False, Officials Confirm Water Is Safe;Assertion: Influencer Thomas Thrap Huse (Pimp Lotion) and the company Vannrenser.no claim that Oslo’s drinking water from Maridalen is heavily polluted, requiring consumers to buy reverse osmosis water filters to remove contaminants such as PFAS. They suggest that untreated tap water can cause issues like low energy and brain fog, and that the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) supports or is referenced to validate these claims. --- Conclusion: False. Extensive evidence from multiple authoritative sources, including the Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, confirms that Oslo’s drinking water, including that from Maridalsvannet, is safe and meets all regulatory standards. Regular and frequent testing shows contaminant levels, including PFAS, to be very low and well below international limits. FHI has explicitly requested Vannrenser.no to remove references and logos implying endorsement, stating that post-treatment filters are unnecessary for water from public waterworks. Scientific experts emphasize that PFAS exposure from drinking water in Oslo is minimal, with food being a much more significant source. Reverse osmosis filters are generally only recommended in specific cases such as private wells near known contamination sites, not for public water supplies like Oslo’s. --- If you want, I can help draft a brief social media post or a more detailed report as well!;Certainly! Here’s a concise fact-check verdict structured as requested: --- 1. What is the claim? Oslo’s drinking water from Maridalen is so polluted that residents need to buy reverse osmosis water filters (as promoted by influencer Thomas Thrap Huse and Vannrenser.no) to remove contaminants like PFAS, with implied support from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. --- 2. What is the verdict? False. --- 3. What evidence supports this decision?  The Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration regularly tests Oslo’s drinking water, including Maridalsvannet, and confirms it meets all drinking water quality regulations.  PFAS levels detected in the water are very low, well below international safety limits, and do not pose a significant health risk.  The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) explicitly requested Vannrenser.no to remove references and logos suggesting FHI endorsement, stating that post-treatment filters are unnecessary for public water supplies.  Experts confirm that PFAS exposure mainly comes from food, not drinking water in Oslo, and that water utilities are responsible for maintaining safe water quality.  Reverse osmosis filtration is generally only recommended for private water sources in specific contamination scenarios, not for public waterworks like those serving Oslo. --- Let me know if you want a more detailed breakdown or a simplified version!;Fact Check: Claim of Polluted Oslo Drinking Water Requiring Filters is False;"Assertion: Influencer and artist Thomas Thrap Huse (Pimp Lotion) and the company Vannrenser.no claim that Oslo's drinking water from Maridalen is so polluted, particularly with PFAS, that a reverse osmosis filter is necessary to purify it, leading to increased energy levels and reduced brain fog. Vannrenser.no also implies endorsement from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) for their filters. Conclusion: False. The claim that Oslo's drinking water from Maridalen is polluted to the extent that a filter is necessary is false. Evidence supporting this conclusion:  The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) explicitly states that it is not necessary to purify drinking water from a waterworks with a filter, as waterworks treat the water to make it safe. FHI has also requested Vannrenser.no to remove references and their logo, indicating no endorsement.  Toril Giske, functional manager for water quality at the Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration, confirms that Oslo's drinking water, including from Maridalsvannet, is safe, meets all requirements in drinking water regulations, and is frequently tested. She states that the claims made are not balanced or fact-based.  While PFAS are present in the environment, Cathrine Brecke Gundersen, a researcher at the Norwegian Institute for Water Research (NIVA), states that PFAS levels in drinking water from public waterworks in Southern Norway, including Maridalsvannet, are very low and well below stringent international drinking water limits.  Both Giske and Gundersen agree that drinking water is not a significant source of PFAS exposure for humans; the primary source is food.  Gundersen generally deems reverse osmosis filters unnecessary in Norway, suggesting their potential use only for private water sources near specific contamination sites, not for public water supplies.";1. What is the claim? Influencer Thomas Thrap Huse (Pimp Lotion) and the company Vannrenser.no assert that Oslo's drinking water from Maridalen is significantly polluted, specifically with PFAS, necessitating the use of a reverse osmosis water filter to purify it. They also claim that using such a filter can lead to increased energy levels and the elimination of brain fog, and imply that the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) endorses their product. 2. What is the verdict? False. 3. What evidence supports this decision?  Safety of Oslo's Drinking Water: Toril Giske, from the Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration, unequivocally states that Oslo's drinking water, including from Maridalsvannet, is safe, meets all regulatory requirements, and undergoes weekly testing to ensure high quality. She explicitly refutes the podcast's claims as not providing a balanced or fact-based picture of water quality.  PFAS Levels: Cathrine Brecke Gundersen, a researcher at the Norwegian Institute for Water Research (NIVA), confirms that while PFAS are present in Maridalsvannet, they are at very low levels that are below the most stringent international drinking water limits. She further clarifies that drinking water is not considered a significant source of PFAS exposure in Southern Norway. Tests in Maridalsvannet detected only 3 out of 17 PFAS compounds, all at values well below the prescribed limit in new drinking water regulations.  Necessity of Filters: Both the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) and Cathrine Brecke Gundersen from NIVA state that it is generally not necessary to filter public drinking water in Norway. FHI advises that The vast majority of people get their drinking water from a waterworks, which treats the water so that it is safe to drink. Gundersen suggests filters might only be appropriate for private wells near specific contamination sources, not for public supplies.  FHI Endorsement: FHI has explicitly asked Vannrenser.no to remove their logo and moderate references on their website, indicating no endorsement of the company or its claims. The company's continued use of FHI's name in capital letters, despite requests, does not constitute endorsement.  Health Benefits: The claims of increased energy and reduced brain fog from filtering already safe drinking water are unsubstantiated by the provided information. The primary source of PFAS for humans is food, not public drinking water, making a water filter for this purpose largely ineffective in reducing overall PFAS exposure.;False Claim: Oslo's Tap Water Not So Polluted It Requires Filter, Say Health and Water Authorities;"Assertion The claim being assessed is that Oslo's drinking water from Maridalen is so polluted that it is advisable to purchase a water filter to purify the drinking water, as stated by influencer Thomas Thrap Huse (Pimp Lotion) and the company Vannrenser.no. Conclusion The verdict is False. The evidence from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI), the Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration, and the Norwegian Institute for Water Research (NIVA) confirms that: Oslo's drinking water is safe and meets all requirements in the drinking water regulations.

Vannrenser.no advertises these filters, claiming they remove all contaminants, leading to increased energy levels and reduced brain fog. The website also references the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) to support its claims. Conclusion Verdict: False The evidence overwhelmingly contradicts the claim that Oslo's drinking water from Maridalen is so polluted that it requires filtration. According to Toril Giske from the Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration, Oslo's drinking water, including from Maridalsvannet, is safe and meets all requirements of the Drinking Water Regulations, with weekly sampling and quarterly PFAS testing showing either no detectable PFAS or levels well below regulatory limits. Cathrine Brecke Gundersen from the Norwegian Institute for Water Research (NIVA) confirms that PFAS levels in Maridalsvannet are low and not a significant exposure source compared to food, which is the primary source of PFAS for humans, as supported by the EU's EFSA. Marianne Steinberg from FHI clarifies that no additional purification is necessary for water from public waterworks, and FHI has asked Vannrenser.no to remove misleading references to their organization, indicating the company's claims lack FHI's endorsement. While PFAS are present in the environment, the levels in Oslo’s drinking water are not high enough to warrant the use of reverse osmosis filters for public water supplies. The claims about increased energy and reduced brain fog lack scientific backing in this context, further undermining the assertion.;1. What is the claim?

FC_13;Assertion;Claims that ski wax pollutes Oslo's drinking water;Assertion:In areas where a lot of ski lubrication is used, there is extra PFAS (a type of synthetic substance). It ends up in Maridalsvannet and is not cleaned. I can guarantee you that the water you get from the tap contains a lot of crap.Thomas Thrap Huse (Pimp Lotion), republished by @vannrenser.no on TikTokConclusion:The drinking water in Oslo undergoes rigorous testing, is monitored weekly, and meets all requirements of the Drinking Water Regulations. It is safe to drink, and a water filter is not necessary. PFAS can occur in drinking water, but the levels are well below safe limits.;According to influencer and artist Thomas Thrap Huse (Pimp Lotion), and the company Vannrenser.no, Oslo's drinking water from Maridalen is so polluted that we are advised to purchase a water filter to purify our drinking water. TikTok user @vannrenser.no is apparently advertising the website of the same name , where you can purchase the filters. According to the website, the so-called reverse osmosis filter is supposed to remove absolutely all contaminants, which in turn can lead to increased energy levels and help us get rid of brain fog. The website Vannrenser.no mentions the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) several times on its website. Faktisk.no has obtained access to emails between Vannrenser.no and FHI, in which the latter asks the company to moderate the references on its website and remove the FHI logo. Get Faktisk.no straight to your inbox.  Click here to sign up for our weekly newsletter . This is what one of the places on the website Vannrenser.no looks like where FHI's name is used. Screenshot Vannrenser.noFollowing the email correspondence, Vannrenser.no has moderated the text somewhat and they have removed the logo and instead written FHI in capital letters - along with other logos.As Marianne Steinberg, senior advisor at FHI, sees it, the company has not complied with FHI's requirements. – In the correspondence a few months ago, FHI asked the website to remove the reference to us through the logo and previous comments on some of Vannrenser.no's professional content that FHI believes gives the wrong impression of what they inform about, says Steinberg. Steinberg clarifies above Faktisk.no what FHI's advice regarding drinking water is:  – It is not necessary to purify drinking water from a waterworks with a filter or other post-treatment. The vast majority of people get their drinking water from a waterworks, which treats the water so that it is safe to drink. But could there be something to be said for a water filter like Pimp Lotion claims in the video posted by the company? The user @vannrenser.no on TikTok uses a clip of Thomas Thrap Huse talking about water quality and water filtration. Screenshot TikTokTests weekly– The drinking water in Oslo, including from Maridalsvannet, is safe and meets all requirements in the drinking water regulations . This is what Toril Giske, functional manager for water quality at the Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration, tells Faktisk.no. She explains that they conduct frequent tests to ensure that the quality of drinking water is always high.– The claims made in the podcast do not provide a balanced or fact-based picture of water quality in Oslo. The Water and Wastewater Agency relies on extensive monitoring and scientific documentation to ensure that the drinking water supplied to Oslo's population is safe and good. She adds: The Norwegian Institute of Public Health:These are PFASPFAS are a large group of man-made synthetic substances, of which there are approximately 10,000.PFAS have been used for over 50 years in a variety of products, including food packaging, non-stick coatings for pots and pans, textile impregnation agents, fire-fighting foams, cleaning products, cosmetics, paints, varnishes and some types of ski lubricants. In addition, fire-fighting foams have been found to be an important source of PFAS in the environment in Norway.PFAS are not produced in Norway. Everything that is traded is imported, either in the form of chemical-technical products or as a component in solid processed products.PFAS are widely distributed in the environment. Animals at the top of the food chain have higher amounts of a number of these substances in their bodies than animals further down the food chain.Source: NIPH and NIVA– This involves weekly sampling at the water treatment plants and in the pipeline network. This is done in accordance with the requirements set for water utility owners in the Drinking Water Regulations.– Found everywhereIn the aforementioned podcast, Thomas Thrap Huse focuses particularly on PFAS (see fact box) in drinking water as one of the main reasons why he believes it is wise to use a reverse osmosis filter. PFAS are substances that are very stable and are therefore referred to as forever chemicals. Cathrine Brecke Gundersen, who researches environmental chemicals at the Norwegian Institute for Water Research (NIVA), tells Faktisk.no. “PFAS are often added to the surface of a product and can be washed off during use and washing. Because PFAS have so many different uses, we find the substances almost everywhere, both outdoors and indoors,” says Gundersen.She points out that virtually all people have PFASs in their blood because some of these substances are found almost everywhere. We do not have thorough data on the harmful effects of all types of PFAS, but several types have been linked to harmful effects that can, among other things, disrupt the immune system, reduce the effectiveness of vaccines, inhibit fetal development and be carcinogenic. Very low levelsThe level of PFAS in drinking water has recently been investigated in Southern Norway, including in Maridalsvannet. Cathrine Brecke Gundersen has a PhD in environmental chemistry and is a researcher at the Norwegian Institute for Water Resources (NIVA). Photo: NIVA. – Not surprisingly, PFAS was found, but at low levels that are below the most stringent international drinking water limits. PFAS in drinking water from public waterworks in southern parts of Norway is low and therefore drinking water is not considered a significant source,  says Gundersen.This is also confirmed by Toril Giske from the Norwegian Water and Sewage Administration. At the same time, she says that it is true that PFAS can be found in some types of ski lubricant: – We regularly monitor water quality and analyze, among other things, for PFAS, which can be found in certain types of ski lubricant. When it comes to PFAS, we analyze quarterly for 17 different compounds at both of our raw water sources, Maridalsvannet and Elvåga. According to Giske, none of these compounds were detected in samples taken at Elvåga in 2024. – In samples from Maridalsvannet, we have found a few of these (3 out of 17), but these are very low values that are well below the prescribed limit value for PFAS compounds in the new drinking water regulations. Giske tells Faktisk.no that the water quality is safe and is continuously monitored.Drinking water not the main sourceShe says that the most important source of PFAS for humans is the food we eat. This is also stated by the EU's EFSA, which carries out risk assessments on the levels of PFAS that humans can ingest. Cathrine Brecke Gundersen at NIVA therefore believes that it is generally not necessary to use a reverse osmosis filter in Norway. – To reduce exposure to PFAS, it is recommended to be aware of which products you buy and surround yourself with. Products marked with the Nordic Ecolabel guarantee to be free of PFAS, says Gundersen.The researcher believes that places where such a filter might be appropriate are at private water sources, such as a well, located near a firefighting training area or at places where PFAS has previously been produced.

False 3.

Another viral video, claimed to show the Fordow attack, was previously circulated in December 2024 and shows an Israeli strike on Tartus, Syria. It was used by media outlets like The Daily Mail in that context.

What is the verdict (true/false/mixed)? False. 3. Justify the decision based on key supporting evidence. The fact-check thoroughly debunks each video using reverse image searches:  Video purporting to show US attack on Fordow (1.5 million views on TikTok): This video is identified as likely showing a Ukrainian attack on a Russian ammunition depot in Toropets, Tver region, in September 2024. This event was so powerful it affected seismometers in Norway and was reported by international and Norwegian media including Reuters, NRK, TV2, The Guardian, and CNN in connection with the Ukrainian attack.  Another video also purporting to show the Fordow attack: This video has been shared multiple times in December 2024, including by Belgian EU MP Marc Botenga on X. It allegedly shows an Israeli attack on the Syrian coastal city of Tartus, following the fall of the Assad regime, and was used by media outlets like the Daily Mail in their coverage of that event.  Video claimed to show Iranian attacks against Israel: A reverse image search revealed this video is from the celebration of the Algerian football club Mouloudia Club's 103rd anniversary. A simple Google search confirms this, showing other posts with the same video from the celebration. Therefore, none of the viral videos actually depict the claimed attacks. While actual US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities did occur on June 22, 2025, and there have been ongoing tensions and attacks between Israel and Iran, the specific videos circulating on social media are miscontextualized or entirely unrelated.;Videos Claiming to Show US Bombing of Iran's Nuclear Facilities Are Actually Footage from Other Events;Social media videos claiming to show the US bombing of Iranian nuclear facilities on June 22 are actually footage from unrelated events, including a Ukrainian attack on a Russian ammunition depot and an Israeli attack on Syria, as well as a celebration of an Algerian football club's anniversary.;Here's the verdict of the fact-check: Claim being evaluated: The US bombed Iranian nuclear facilities on June 22, and videos circulating on social media show the attacks.

Reverse image searches revealed that the videos are actually from different events, such as: A Ukrainian attack on a Russian ammunition depot in September 2024. An Israeli attack on the Syrian coastal city of Tartus. A celebration of an Algerian football club's 103rd anniversary. There's no verified evidence provided to support the claim that the US bombed Iranian nuclear facilities on June 22, and Iranian authorities deny serious damage.

Claim Being Evaluated: Videos circulating on social media, purportedly showing U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities in Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan on June 22, as well as Iranian attacks on Israel, are claimed to depict recent military actions. 2. Verdict: False. 3. Justification Based on Key Supporting Evidence: - A widely shared video claimed to show a U.S. attack on the Fordow facility was identified through reverse image search as depicting a Ukrainian attack on a Russian ammunition depot in Toropets, Tver region, in September 2024. This was corroborated by international media outlets like Reuters, NRK, TV2, The Guardian, and CNN, which used the video in coverage of the Ukrainian attack. - Another video, alleged to show the Fordow attack, was traced via reverse image search to December 2024, showing an Israeli attack on Tartus, Syria, following the fall of the Assad regime, as reported by media like the Daily Mail and shared by Belgian EU MP Marc Botenga on X. - A third video, claimed to depict Iranian attacks on Israel, was identified through reverse image search and Google search as footage from the 103rd anniversary celebration of the Algerian football club Mouloudia Club, confirmed by multiple posts related to the event. - The misattribution of these videos to recent U.S. or Iranian military actions is unsupported by evidence, as they clearly originate from unrelated events, locations, and times.

Claim being assessed: Videos circulating on social media purportedly show recent U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities at Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan. 2. Verdict: False. 3. Reasoning/Evidence: Reverse image and video searches reveal that these viral clips are unrelated to the claimed attacks—one shows a Ukrainian strike on a Russian ammunition depot in 2024, another depicts an Israeli attack on Syria’s Tartus city, and a third is footage from an Algerian football club’s anniversary celebration. Multiple reputable international media outlets have verified the true origins of these videos, disproving their connection to any U.S. strike on Iran.;Fact Check: Viral Videos Purporting to Show US Bombing of Iranian Nuclear Facilities on June 22 Are Misleading.;Amidst claims of the United States bombing Iranian nuclear facilities on June 22 and circulating dramatic videos, a fact-check reveals that many of these clips are miscontextualized, depicting unrelated events such as a Ukrainian attack in Russia, an Israeli strike in Syria, or a football club celebration in Algeria.;Here's the verdict for the fact-check: 1. What is the claim being assessed? The core claim being assessed is that the United States bombed the three Iranian nuclear facilities of Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan on the night of Sunday, June 22, and that widely shared dramatic videos on social media purportedly show these attacks. 2. What is the verdict (true/false/mixed)? Mixed, but largely False regarding the videos. 3. What reasoning or evidence supports the conclusion?  Regarding the US attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities: The fact-check implicitly accepts that US attacks on these facilities occurred on June 22. This is supported by multiple news reports and official statements (as seen in the search results) confirming strikes by the United States on Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan on June 22, 2025. There's an ongoing debate about the extent of the damage, with the US claiming obliteration and Iran downplaying the severity, but the strikes themselves are confirmed.  Regarding the videos purporting to show the attacks: This is where the claim is False. The fact-check explicitly states that many of these clips turn out to be from completely different times and events. It provides concrete evidence for three specific widely shared videos:  One video, widely shared on TikTok as a US attack on Fordow, probably shows a Ukrainian attack on a Russian ammunition depot in September 2024 in Toropets, Russia. This was found via reverse image search and corroborated by media outlets like NRK, TV2, The Guardian, and CNN.  Another video purporting to show the Fordow attack actually has been shared several times in December 2024 and allegedly shows an Israeli attack on the Syrian coastal city of Tartus following the fall of the Assad regime, as reported by outlets like the Daily Mail.  A third video claimed to show Iranian attacks against Israel is, in fact, from the celebration of the Algerian football club Mouloudia Club's 103rd anniversary, confirmed by reverse image search and a simple Google search. Therefore, while the actual US attacks on Iran's nuclear facilities on June 22 are a confirmed event, the dramatic videos circulating on social media purporting to show these specific attacks are largely misleading and depict unrelated events.;Videos Claiming to Show US Attacks on Iran Are Actually from Other Incidents;Videos circulating on social media purporting to show US attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities and Iranian attacks on Israel have been debunked as misinformation, with the clips actually showing unrelated events such as a Ukrainian attack on a Russian ammunition depot and a celebration of an Algerian football club.;The claim being assessed is that certain videos on social media show the US attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities (specifically Fordow) and Iranian attacks on Israel. The verdict is: False. The reasoning or evidence that supports the conclusion is: Reverse image searches revealed that the videos were not of the claimed events but of other incidents, such as a Ukrainian attack on a Russian ammunition depot and a celebration of an Algerian football club. The videos were previously used by reputable media outlets in different contexts, unrelated to the US-Iran conflict. The geolocation and timing of the events in the videos do not match the claimed events.;Videos Claiming U.S. Attacks on Iranian Nuclear Facilities Are False, Show Unrelated Events;Social media videos claiming to depict U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities in June 2025 are misleading, as they actually show unrelated events, including a Ukrainian attack on a Russian depot, an Israeli strike in Syria, and an Algerian football celebration.; Fact-Check Verdict 1. Claim Being Assessed: Social media videos claim to depict U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities (Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan) on June 22, 2025, Iranian attacks against Israel, and related military actions. 2. Verdict: False 3. Reasoning and Evidence Supporting the Conclusion: - Video Purporting to Show U.S. Attack on Fordow: A widely shared video, viewed 1.5 million times on TikTok, was identified through a reverse image search as footage from a Ukrainian attack on a Russian ammunition depot in Toropets, Tver region, in September 2024. This attack was significant enough to affect seismometers in Norway and was reported by reputable outlets like Reuters, NRK, TV2, The Guardian, and CNN, none of which connect it to Iran. - Video Allegedly Showing Another Fordow Attack: Another video circulating on TikTok, also claiming to depict the Fordow attack, was traced via reverse image search to posts from December 2024, including one by Belgian EU MP Marc Botenga on X. It likely shows an Israeli attack on Tartus, Syria, following the fall of the Assad regime, as reported by the Daily Mail and other media. - Video Claiming Iranian Attacks on Israel: A third video, shared on social media as evidence of Iranian attacks on Israel, was found on YouTube with an Arabic title indicating it is footage from the 103rd anniversary celebration of the Algerian football club Mouloudia Club. A Google search confirmed this context through multiple posts about the celebration. - Conclusion: None of the videos show U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities or Iranian attacks on Israel. Instead, they depict unrelated events from different times and locations, verified through reverse image searches and credible media reports. The claims are therefore false, as the videos are misattributed and do not represent the events they are claimed to depict.

The legitimate organization has 16,000 followers, while the imposter page has only 900. The real Swedish Diabetes Association explicitly states they do not recommend, certify, or endorse products, services, or medicines.  Scam Link: The link provided on the fake page leads to a site mimicking the Swedish Diabetes Association's branding, offering the dietary supplement for 700 kronor with a promise of 60 kilos weight loss – a claim deemed a total fake by medical experts.  AI-Generated Images: The before and after photo of the sisters appears to be AI-generated and has no other online presence.  Fake Testimonials: The comments section is filled with fake profiles using stolen before and after photos from legitimate weight loss success stories on platforms like Reddit. For example, Maja Karlsson and Elin Andersson use pictures from individuals in other parts of the world.  Page History: The scammers' Facebook page was created in 2023 as The KING Photography and only changed its name to Diabetesförbundet in April 2025, indicating a deceptive rebranding. The page is controlled from Hong Kong and China, which explains why fake profiles have friends exclusively from Asian countries.  Expert Testimony:  Fredrik Nyström, professor researching risk factors for cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes at Linköping University: States there are no dietary supplements that have these effects, it is a total fake. He also notes that if a dietary supplement could cause such significant weight loss, pharmaceutical companies would have acquired it long ago.  Åke Lernmark, senior professor in experimental diabetes at Lund University: Confirms that dietary supplements such as pills do not lead to weight loss.  Exploitation of Public Figures: The scammers have used names and images of various Swedish heart and obesity researchers, including Fredrik Nyström himself, and Olivia Wigzell, Director General of the Public Health Agency, in their fake advertisements without permission.

The images used in the post appear to be AI-generated and not real. Experts, including professors of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, confirm that there is no dietary supplement that can achieve the promised weight loss results.

What is the final verdict? False. 3. What evidence or reasoning supports this verdict? - The Facebook page is a fake, mimicking the real Swedish Diabetes Association.

They note that legitimate weight-loss medications exist, but pharmaceutical companies would have acquired any effective supplement, and the product in question lacks credible evidence. - The scam site linked in the ad uses the Swedish Diabetes Association’s logo without permission and offers the supplement for 700 kronor, a tactic typical of fraudulent schemes promising unrealistic results. - The use of deep-faked or stolen identities of public figures, such as Swedish researchers and officials, further undermines the claim’s credibility.

Their Facebook page has just over 900 followers and if you search Facebook's search function for Diabetesförbundet you will find the real organization, with 16,000 followers.The Swedish Diabetes Association neither recommends, certifies nor endorses products, services or medicines, writes Bjørn Ehlin, chairman of the real interest organization, to the Source Criticism Agency:In 2025, we have seen an increase in the number of advertisements on social media where advertisers use the names and logos of various organizations and authorities without permission, including the Swedish Diabetes Association and the Swedish Medical Products Agency.We take seriously the creation of accounts and pages on social media with our name and logo, as well as websites;Chain-of-Thought;Fake Facebook Page Falsely Claims Swedish Diabetes Association Endorses Weight-Loss Supplement — Verdict: False;A viral Facebook post falsely claiming to be from the Swedish Diabetes Association promotes a weight-loss dietary supplement using a fabricated story and AI-generated images. The claim is false—the real association has no connection to the ad and warns against scams misusing its name and logo.;1. What is the claim being evaluated? The claim is that the Swedish Diabetes Association endorses a dietary supplement that helped a woman lose weight after her sister's death, as featured in a Facebook post using before-and-after images and a personal story. 2. What is the verdict? False. 3. Justify the decision based on key supporting evidence:  The Facebook page is fake: It superficially mimics the Swedish Diabetes Association's branding but was previously named The KING Photography and only recently changed its name.  The real Swedish Diabetes Association has disavowed the product and any involvement, explicitly stating they do not endorse or sell dietary supplements.  The story and images are fabricated: The photos appear to be AI-generated or stolen from unrelated sources, and the commenters praising the product are from fake profiles using stolen images from other websites like Reddit.  Experts confirm the product is a scam: Professors Fredrik Nyström and Åke Lernmark have both stated there is no evidence that such dietary supplements work, and that reputable treatments for weight loss are prescribed medications, not miracle pills.  The scam has broader implications: Similar fake ads are exploiting the names and likenesses of Swedish public figures and institutions using AI-generated media, showing a pattern of deliberate deception.;False: Swedish Diabetes Association Promotes Fake Weight Loss Supplement with Stolen Stories;A Facebook page impersonating the Swedish Diabetes Association is promoting a weight loss supplement with a fabricated story and stolen images. This is a scam, as the real Swedish Diabetes Association does not endorse products, and experts confirm the advertised supplement has no weight-loss properties.;Here's the verdict of the fact-check: 1. What is the claim being evaluated? The claim being evaluated is that a dietary supplement, promoted by a Facebook page falsely claiming to be the Swedish Diabetes Association, can lead to significant weight loss (e.g., 60 kilos) and is a legitimate product endorsed by a reputable health organization. The claim also implies that the personal weight loss stories shared in the comments are genuine. 2. What is the verdict (true/false/mixed)? False. 3. Justify the decision based on key supporting evidence. The decision is justified by several key pieces of evidence:  Impersonation and Lack of Endorsement: The Facebook page Diabetesförbundet is a copy of the real Swedish Diabetes Association's page, using their name and logo without permission. The real Swedish Diabetes Association explicitly states that it neither recommends, certifies nor endorses products, services or medicines.  Expert Consensus on Dietary Supplements: Professors Fredrik Nyström (Linköping University) and Åke Lernmark (Lund University), experts in cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes, unequivocally state that there are no dietary supplements that have these effects, it is a total fake. They further emphasize that dietary supplements such as pills do not lead to weight loss.  Fabricated Testimonials and AI-Generated Images: The before and after photos of the sisters in the main post appear to be AI-generated and have not been published elsewhere. The supposed testimonials in the comments section, attributed to individuals like Maja Karlsson and Elin Andersson, use images stolen from genuine weight loss success stories on platforms like Reddit.  Fake Profiles and Origin of Scam: The Facebook profiles posting these fake testimonials are demonstrably false, with limited activity, generic profile pictures, and friends predominantly from Asian countries, aligning with the cloned page's control from Hong Kong and China.  Page Transparency: The scam page's transparency section reveals it was originally named The KING Photography and only changed its name to Diabetesförbundet in April of the current year (2025), indicating a deceptive rebranding.  Misuse of Public Figures: The scammers have exploited the names and images, and even deep-faked videos, of various Swedish heart and obesity researchers and public health officials (like Fredrik Nyström and Lars Wallentin) to lend false credibility to their advertisements.;False: Dietary Supplement Ads Claiming 60kg Weight Loss Using Swedish Diabetes Association;A Facebook page impersonating the Swedish Diabetes Association has been promoting a dietary supplement with exaggerated weight loss claims, using AI-generated images and fake testimonials.

Verdict: False Justification: The Swedish Diabetes Association has denied any involvement with the product and stated that they do not recommend or endorse any dietary supplements or medicines. Experts in diabetes and obesity research, such as Fredrik Nyström and Åke Lernmark, have stated that there is no dietary supplement that can lead to significant weight loss as claimed, and that such claims are likely fake. Investigation revealed that the Facebook page is a scam, using AI-generated images, fake profiles, and stolen images of public figures to deceive potential buyers. The page's history and administration also suggest a scam, with the page being controlled from Hong Kong and China, and having previously been used for unrelated purposes.;Fake Swedish Diabetes Association Page’s Claim of Dietary Supplement Causing 60-Kilo Weight Loss Proven False;A Facebook page posing as the Swedish Diabetes Association claims a dietary supplement helped a woman lose significant weight after her sister’s death, but the page is a scam using stolen images and false claims. Investigations reveal the page is not affiliated with the legitimate organization, and experts confirm the supplement’s weight loss promises are fake. This fact-check exposes the deceptive tactics behind the fraudulent campaign.;1. Claim Being Evaluated: The claim is that a dietary supplement, promoted by a Facebook page posing as the Swedish Diabetes Association, enabled a woman to lose significant weight (60 kilos) as depicted in a before-and-after photo, accompanied by a story about two sisters, one of whom died from a heart attack related to weight issues. 2. Verdict: False 3. Justification Based on Key Supporting Evidence: - Fake Facebook Page: The Facebook page claiming to be the Swedish Diabetes Association is not affiliated with the legitimate organization. The real Swedish Diabetes Association has 16,000 followers, while the scam page has only 900. The page was originally named “The KING Photography” and rebranded to “Diabetesförbundet” in April 2025, with administrators based in Hong Kong and China, indicating fraudulent intent. - Stolen and AI-Generated Content: The before-and-after images are either AI-generated or stolen from unrelated weight loss stories on platforms like Reddit, not depicting the individuals claimed in the post. Comments supporting the product’s efficacy come from fake profiles with stolen images and connections primarily from Asian countries. - Expert Testimony: Professors Fredrik Nyström and Åke Lernmark, experts in obesity and diabetes research, confirm that no dietary supplement can achieve the claimed weight loss of 60 kilos. Nyström notes that such a product, if effective, would be widely known and acquired by pharmaceutical companies, dismissing the supplement as a fake. - Official Statement: Björn Ehlin, chairman of the real Swedish Diabetes Association, states that the organization does not endorse or recommend any products, including dietary supplements. The association warns against scams using their name and logo, urging source criticism. - Deceptive Advertising Tactics: The scam page links to a fraudulent website mimicking the Swedish Diabetes Association, offering the supplement for 700 kronor. The use of stolen images, fabricated stories, and fake endorsements from public figures like researchers and health officials further confirms the deceptive nature of the claim. The combination of a fraudulent page, falsified content, expert dismissal of the product’s efficacy, and the legitimate organization’s disavowal conclusively demonstrates that the claim is false.

The page was originally named The KING Photography and changed its name to mimic the Swedish Diabetes Association, indicating fraudulent intent.

The Swedish Diabetes Association does not endorse any such product. 3. What evidence supports this decision? - Fake Facebook Page: The page claiming to be the Swedish Diabetes Association is a scam, as confirmed by Björn Ehlin, chairman of the real Swedish Diabetes Association.

Nyström notes that such a product, if real, would be widely known and acquired by pharmaceutical companies. - Swedish Diabetes Association Statement: The real Swedish Diabetes Association explicitly states it does not recommend, certify, or endorse products, services, or medicines.

Final Verdict: False. 3. Reasoning:  Impersonation and Deception: The Facebook page is a fraudulent copy of the real Swedish Diabetes Association. It uses the legitimate organization's name, address, and even links to its actual website to create a false sense of credibility. The real Swedish Diabetes Association explicitly states that it does not recommend, certify, or endorse products, services, or medicines, and has warned about an increase in such deceptive advertisements.  Fabricated Story and Imagery: The emotional story of the two sisters and the before-and-after photos are entirely fabricated. The images of the women appear to be AI-generated, and the success stories in the comments section use stolen before-and-after pictures from genuine weight-loss journeys shared on platforms like Reddit.  No Scientific Basis for Product Claims: Experts, including Professor Fredrik Nyström from Linköping University and Professor Åke Lernmark from Lund University, unequivocally state that there are no dietary supplements with the claimed drastic weight-loss effects. They dismiss the product as a total fake and a miracle pill hoax. While prescription medications for weight loss exist, this dietary supplement does not possess those properties, and if it did, it would be a well-known pharmaceutical, not an obscure supplement.  Fake Profiles and Origin of Scam: The comments section is populated by fake profiles, often with friends from Asian countries, mirroring the discovery that the cloned page is controlled from Hong Kong and China. The page's history further reveals its deceptive nature, as it was originally a photography page and only changed its name to Diabetesförbundet in April of the current year.

The claim is false; the page is a scam using stolen images, fake profiles, and unauthorized branding, with no evidence supporting the supplement’s effectiveness. This fact-check exposes the deceptive tactics of a fraudulent campaign exploiting the Swedish Diabetes Association’s identity to sell a nonexistent weight-loss product.";1. What is the claim? The claim is that a dietary supplement, promoted by a Facebook page posing as the Swedish Diabetes Association, enabled significant weight loss for a woman, as illustrated by a before-and-after photo and a story about two sisters, one of whom died. The post suggests the supplement is endorsed by the Swedish Diabetes Association and can lead to dramatic weight loss, such as 60 kilos, for 700 kronor. 2. What is the final verdict? The claim is false. 3. What reasoning supports this decision? - Fake Identity and Unauthorized Branding: The Facebook page claiming to be the Swedish Diabetes Association is a fraudulent copy, not affiliated with the real organization, which has 16,000 followers compared to the scam page’s 900. The Swedish Diabetes Association, through its chairman Bjørn Ehlin, explicitly states it does not endorse or recommend products, services, or medicines, and has noted an increase in such unauthorized uses of its name and logo. - Stolen and AI-Generated Content: The before-and-after images are either AI-generated or stolen from unrelated weight-loss stories on platforms like Reddit, not depicting the individuals claimed in the post. The comments section is filled with fake profiles, many linked to Asian countries, further indicating a coordinated scam. - No Evidence for Supplement’s Efficacy: Experts, including Professor Fredrik Nyström and Professor Åke Lernmark, confirm that no dietary supplement can achieve the claimed weight loss (e.g., 60 kilos). Such claims are typical of scams, as legitimate pharmaceutical companies would have commercialized any effective product. Existing weight-loss medications work differently and are regulated, unlike the unverified supplement in the ad. - Scam Tactics and Origins: The page, originally named “The KING Photography” and renamed in April 2025, is controlled from Hong Kong and China, and its ads exploit public figures and authorities without permission. The linked website mimics the Swedish Diabetes Association’s branding to deceive users, a common tactic in fraudulent schemes.
